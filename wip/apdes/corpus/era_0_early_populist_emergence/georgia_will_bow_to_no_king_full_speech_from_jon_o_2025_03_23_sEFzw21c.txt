Atlanta,
Atlanta, give it up again for our
Senator, Reverend Raphael Waro.
Atlanta, you look beautiful.
You look beautiful.
Thank you, Gerald.
These are serious times. Atlanta
with open contempt for the law.
This president has launched a power grab
unprecedented in our history,
abusing his power
and trying to poison our democracy with
fear and intimidation.
In his first 100 days, he set free
criminals who did violence on his
behalf.
He purged independent watchd dogs across
the government who investigate
corruption and abuse.
He stacked the most powerful offices
with personal loyalists and then called
on those same loyalists to investigate
and prosecute his opponents.
He's undermined the freedom of the
press. He's retaliated against lawyers
who have opposed him in court. He's
defied and threatened federal judges.
And he's given massive and unaccountable
power to the richest man in the world
who spent $300 million to elect him
president of the United States.
Now,
Atlanta, Atlanta, this is not a drill.
Atlanta, this is not a bad dream.
As citizens, this is the test of our
lifetime. So tell me, Atlanta, are you
ready to fight?
Let's
go. Are you ready to fight, Atlanta?
It is truly wonderful to see you all
here.
And I'd like to ask first of all every
veteran in the building, please re raise
your hands and be honored by all of us
here. Thank you for your service. Thank
you. Thank
you. Thank you.
Thank
you. And please know that Raphael and I
are both so grateful for every one of
you for your hard work over so many
years. So many years we've been working
together. Take a moment and turn to your
neighbor. Turn to your neighbor.
Introduce yourself for a moment.
Say to your neighbor.
Say to your neighbor, "Say, we're in
this together."
Say, "We're in this together."
Say, "We're in this together." We're in
this together. Say, "We're in this
together." We're in this together.
We We've been in this fight a long time
together.
And you'll
recall five years ago we faced a
different sort of crisis. It was the
deadliest pandemic since
1918. Thousands died per day. Tens of
millions were out of
work. The lines for the food banks, do
you remember? They ran for
miles. And Donald Trump was president
then, too.
thinking out loud about whether we
should inject ourselves with bleach.
You remember that?
And at that moment of
crisis, we held here in Georgia one of
the most consequential Senate elections
of all time. It was two for one. Two for
one.
It was the Jewish kid and the black
pastor running together with all of you
alongside us.
They said we couldn't win. Do you
remember?
But we built one of the most powerful
movements in Georgia's history. And you
picked me up and you picked Raphael up
and you carried us on your shoulders.
And now it is our deepest honor to
represent you in the Senate. Do you all
remember how it felt to fight and to win
Atlanta?
You remember Bentley?
Look, maybe right now you feel maybe
right now you feel surrounded by
darkness.
You might be a little numb. You might be
wondering if there's a way out.
But Atlanta, we don't have the luxury of
despair because there are so many
counting on us. Children and pregnant
women who rely on Medicaid. Veterans who
have earned their care and benefits.
Children in our public schools. Cancer
patients counting on the next big
breakthrough.
An entire world
hoping the United States has not given
up on freedom.
my little
girl, my little girl and all our
children who deserve to grow up in a
kind and fair and decent country.
And the truth
is, beyond personal revenge, there's not
much to this president's agenda.
It's tax breaks for the rich and
rounding up immigrants. That's the whole
program. We've seen the bill in Ukraine
paid for by blowing out the deficit,
cutting Medicaid, and trying to close
the new factories we helped open that
make chips and solar panels and electric
vehicles. That's the whole agenda.
Let me ask you, yes or no? Will your
family's life improve because we borrow
trillions of dollars to cut taxes for
the wealthiest people in the country?
Will your family's life Will your
family's life improve because our
military bases become prison camps for
immigrants?
When Medicaid covers nearly half of the
births in our state, twothirds of all
seniors in nursing homes, 40% of
children, will your family's life
improve because they got Medicaid? No.
See, part of the shame of this useless
spiral into chaos and
revenge is that we really face so many
urgent challenges and there are so many
problems that we can
solve. Our prisons are full of violence
and abuse. Women die needlessly from
pregnancy and child birth, especially
here in Georgia.
Hospitals continue to close. Seniors
can't afford glasses and hearing aids
because Medicare won't cover them.
Veterans can't get VA coverage for
dental care.
Families live paycheck to paycheck. The
federal debt keeps growing, but top
earners wind up paying less than
firefighters and public school teachers.
Now, look, I'm I'm not saying these
problems are cheap and easy to solve.
But we could solve them
and we must solve them.
And none of this is on the
administration's agenda. They just do
not
care. They do not care.
Trump's cabinet is worth like $60
billion. That's not even including
Elon. They are literally the elites they
pretend to hate.
The president is not at his palace in
Florida thinking about whether you can
afford daycare for your daughter or how
to stop insurance companies from denying
your claim or anything that matters to
our daily lives. When is the last time
you even heard Donald Trump talk about
healthare or childare?
He's talking about invading Greenland.
He's handing your data over to Elon
Musk.
By the way, I'm all for government
efficiency.
And government programs aren't sacred.
They have to work. But when you randomly
fire tens of thousands of people, no
matter what role they fill, no matter
how well they're performing, and then
you have to scramble to fire them back
because you accidentally fired the
people who run the veterans crisis line,
and you accidentally fired the people
who watch out for Ebola at the CDC, and
you accidentally fired the people who
fight bird flu on our poultry farms, and
the people who protect our nuclear
weapons.
When you when you shut down research
into Alzheimer's treatments and cures
for childhood cancer, that's not
efficiency. That's just cruelty and
chaos.
Nazis.
See, and then and then on top of the
chaos, you have the corruption.
It was just reported that dinner with
the president at Mara Lago
is on sale
for just $5 million.
And really the the whole royal family is
cashing
in. Don Jr. is setting up a new business
empire. Jared's investment firm got $2
billion from the Saudi royal family.
Like Hunter Biden should have been more
ambitious. $2 billion from the Saudi
royal family.
The president was already selling those
Bibles made in
China. But now they have their own meme
coins. Did y'all see that?
They literally stopped enforcing the law
that prohibits bribery of foreign
officials.
Secretary of Commerce is pumping up
Tesla stock. The White House has been
converted into a Tesla showroom. While
Elon's money, Elon's money is what keeps
Republican senators in check.
But the truth is
the truth is that corruption in America
runs a lot deeper than Donald Trump.
He's not just a beneficiary of it. His
rise is a symptom
of it.
Citizens United was the most destructive
court decision in modern American
history.
The entire political system is just
overrun by outside money.
Members of Congress live in fear of
these super PACs. It's not just
Elon. Senators get threatened with five,
25, $50 million of opposition over
individual votes on a whole range of
issues.
And see, this is why things don't work
for ordinary people. It's not because of
trans kids or woke college students.
It's not
It's not because of our new arch enemy,
Canada.
The
corruption is why you pay a fortune for
prescriptions.
The corruption is why your insurance
claim keeps getting denied.
The corruption is why hedge funds get to
buy up all the houses in your
neighborhood and Congress doesn't do
anything about it.
See, this is why so many have lost faith
in our system.
Because the system really is rigged.
But Trump's not unrigging it. He's
rerigging it for himself.
But right now, even more corrosive than
the chaos and the
corruption is the fear.
This administration is trying to poison
our democracy with fear and
intimidation. His goal is not just
revenge. He wants to use the government
to crush the opposition.
And this is actually something we have
never faced before.
Not like this.
Before you elected me, I led a team that
exposed corruption and war crimes. We
expose the truth in places where
criticizing the government is
dangerous, where whistleblowers and
witnesses will only meet in
secret, where protest carries the risk
of
prosecution. And the atmosphere in
America under Donald Trump reminds me
more and more of those places.
I've heard it in my office from some of
the most powerful to some of the
least. They say we don't need a federal
investigation.
They say we're not sticking our necks
out right now. They say we don't want
any trouble.
See, Americans
Americans are now living in fear of
their own government.
And it's not just here at home. People
from around the world who want to do
business and research and tourism here
are now being advised by their
governments not to visit the United
States because civil rights and civil
liberties are eroding here so swiftly.
When I first ran for Congress eight
years ago, it was because I saw the
election of someone so unfit for the
presidency as a danger to the country.
And you all got behind me because you
saw the same thing.
And when we won the Senate, it was
because we still understood together the
urgency and the necessity of the moment.
And we knew Georgia could lead the way.
And now each morning when I look at my
beautiful three-year-old girl and her
sweetness and that magical hopeful
innocence and potential, I realize we
have no choice but to keep going.
Georgia,
we have no
choice because
Because I don't want my little girl to
grow up in a hopelessly divided country
where citizens fear their own
government which has become an
instrument of repression and revenge. I
don't want her to grow up in a world
where freedom is in retreat.
I want her to grow up in an America that
continues to lead the free world,
where diversity is celebrated instead of
mocked.
with
leaders with leaders who bring us
together and inspire us to be honest and
decent and kind.
The measure of our success is not how
many of the poorest and most vulnerable
families we hunt down and shackle and
imprison and deport. The measure of our
success is whether each generation
achieves greater health and prosperity
than the last and whether we live up to
the promise of equal justice for all.
Senator Waro and I are on your team.
We're pushing back every day. When they
cut HB.CU scholarships, we fought back
and we won.
And we
won. Republicans in Congress are already
feeling the heat on Medicaid. We are
pushing back every single day. We
understand the assignment
and please trust us when we assure you
that if we all do our part as citizens,
we will overcome this.
We will overcome this.
In my Senate office, just over my desk,
there's a portrait of Congressman Lewis.
And I promise you, his spirit is with us
in this place
right now.
Right now.
The power is still with the people.
Atlanta, Atlanta, are you ready to get
in good trouble?
Atlanta, Atlanta, are you ready to speak
out?
Atlanta, are you ready to organize?
Atlanta, are you ready to march?
Georgia will bow to no king.
And Georgia will lead the way again.
Thank you all. Thank you, Georgia. Thank
you so much. Thank you. Thank you.
I like the way you move.
I like the way you move.
