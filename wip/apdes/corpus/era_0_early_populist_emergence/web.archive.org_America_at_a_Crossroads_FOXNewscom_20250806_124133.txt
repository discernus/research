At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer. View the web archive through the Wayback Machine . Collection: Wide Crawl started March 2011 Web wide crawl with initial seedlist and crawler configuration from March 2011. This uses the new HQ software for distributed crawling by Kenji Nagahashi. What’s in the data set: Crawl start date: 09 March, 2011 Crawl end date: 23 December, 2011 Number of captures: 2,713,676,341 Number of unique URLs: 2,273,840,159 Number of hosts: 29,032,069 The seed list for this crawl was a list of Alexa’s top 1 million web sites, retrieved close to the crawl start date. We used Heritrix (3.1.1-SNAPSHOT) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives. The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites. However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed URLs to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the URLs for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them). We also included repeated crawls of some Argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed. We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available “warts and all” for people to experiment with. We have also done some further analysis of the content . If you would like access to this set of crawl data, please contact us at info at archive dot org and let us know who you are and what you’re hoping to do with it. We may not be able to say “yes” to all requests, since we’re just figuring out whether this is a good idea, but everyone will be considered.

This is what Americans from all points of the political compass meant when they called for change, because it was the American people. The reason why change worked is because -- it didn't come from Barack Obama. It didn't come from a political genius. It came from a focus group. And everybody was saying the same things. That's why all the politicians were saying it. We've got to change. So, now, what do we do? Because time is passing us by. I told you last year prepare. But I'm not a "hunker down" kind of guy. I'm not going to be sitting in a bunker with, you know, food storage. That's not who I am. If -- I was on vacation this holiday. And I was sitting on the beach. And I thought, man, I don't know, I should just move here. Here's the reason -- because I was born at this time for a reason -- and so were you. This country has afforded me all kinds of opportunity. Fifteen years ago, I didn't have a dollar to my name. I'm a -- I'm a well- off guy now. I didn't have formal education. Nobody in my family, I'm the first ever to go to college and I went for one semester because that's all I could afford. Only in America. We're not going to hunker down. And I'm not going to go live on a beach. I owe the idea of America to my children. After spending years and quite frankly, thousands of man hours in research over the last few years and reflection, and prayer, my team and I have come to realize that when I said a couple of years ago that a fundamental transformation of America was not needed, I was wrong. It is required. But it is the polar opposite and far more powerful than what President Obama meant when he called for transformation of America. President Obama and the progressive ruling class both believe that the parties are the solution. That the politicians, they believe in a collective plan society. I believe America's answers are not to be found in Washington. But they are to be found with, by, and in the individual American honestly, pursuing happiness. Not in any 2,000-page bill. If you want to look for those collective base solutions, you can find them. In this phrase: "America is great because America is good." De Tocqueville said this. When we beg for somebody to fix something, we're begging our politicians or our political parties: make us good. They can't. Try as they may, they cannot make us good. But we can. As individuals, we can. We must. And beginning today, we will. The secret our founders understood is that America is good, because the individual American is honest, just, thrifty, responsible, educated, charitable and God-fearing. America is great because America is good. It's not just some trite slogan. It is a deep and well thought out philosophy that has quite frankly over 200 years of evidence -- 200 years of evidence of its truth. Yet, we are being told that it's all a lie. From every level, from our classrooms to our news rooms: America is not good. And she's never been great. My fellow citizens, this country will not survive much longer if that lie continues to be believed. So, what do we do? Well, I have been thinking about this for quite some time. I have been telling you to prepare and I've also been telling you over the last few months, you wait until the beginning of the year. Well, today -- beginning today, we are going to take a page from our own history. History of the Alamo -- we're going to do what they did in the Alamo. And they are going to say, "I'm drawing a line in the sand. If you are with me, you stand on this line." The line is: you must decide on who you are. You must know what you are capable of. And we must look to the heavens to chart our course again. Do we return to the ideas of the past? Or do we continue west to the yet unrealized and unfulfilled promises laid out by these guys? Our founding ideals, the founding ideas. We must choose as individuals. And then most importantly put those choices in action. We have to demonstrate to our children, to our neighbors and to ourselves, most importantly, demonstrate that it is not policies. It's not politicians. It's not parties, but people that make the nation what it is for better and for worse. It is people. This is a set. This is a set. This is the only thing that's real on the set. This isn't connected. It looks like it, but it's not. This would ring if you would have ever called. We have to get to real life. This year, I want to talk to you about what I am going to do and invite you to join me. This year, as an individual, as Glenn Edward Lee Beck who was born in Everett, Washington, in 1964, just like you, a private citizen, not a talk show host -- I stand at the same crossroads that you are standing at now, that our country, every citizen, it's not a collective thing. It is individual. I stand here today and boldly declare my choice. I will not accept that America's best days are behind her. I will no longer accept that there is no such thing as American exceptionalism. There was. There is again when we choose to be exceptional people. I will not stand silently by as the most charitable nation in the history of mankind, now apparently needs the IRS to act as our charitable collection basket. I refuse to believe that Eric Holder is right when he states that we're a nation of cowards when it comes to race. We are not. Look at our history! Look where we have come! My gosh, can anybody put it in context? I will admit our wrongdoings. Have you seen a show talked about manifest destiny before? This one has. But I will also not be a constant apologist for our nation's mistakes. I'll put us up against anybody else -- maybe not so much anymore because we're becoming just like everyone else. I will look to history for the path forward, for the mistakes and context. I believe that while many Americans may be ignorant of even the basics of our history, Americans are waking up in record numbers and they are educating themselves like never before. And when they do, one of the first things they'll learn is that when Americans wake up, Americans change the world for the better. You know, I said the other day, it's time to take the tie and jacket off and time to roll up the sleeves. That is true. I am tired of waiting around for a George Washington or a Ronald Reagan to appear. If they appear? Great, great. I hope they appear down the road because we're moving forward. I will no longer look to others for leadership or answers. We're out of time. I will lead. Me. My family. And I will teach my family and myself to be independent, honorable, educated, self-reliant and charitable. And with firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, I choose to refound this amazing nation by rediscovering it within myself and sharing it within the circle of my own influence. The principles and the ethics that define American exceptionalism -- when we rediscover them as individuals, we'll be exceptional again. In the last 12 months, we have talked about these things. We have talked about faith, hope and charity. But it is time to expand that idea. Will you change this? It is time to put things into practice. We can't just be philosophical. Over the next 12 months, all of the divisions of my company, which I run, called Mercury Radio Arts will focus now on what I call the E-4 solution. The four Es. They're over here. E-1 is enlightenment. "I am that I am." Who are you in relation to everything? Education -- how did we get here? What did people sacrifice? What were the mistakes? Empowerment -- do you know the power that you have as an individual? You're in America. Stop sniveling. Stand up. You were born at this time with the skills you have for a reason.
