================================================================================

35th president of the united states of
america
president donald j trump
hey
media will not show the magnitude of
this crowd even i
turned on today i looked and i saw
thousands of people here but you don't
see hundreds of thousands of people
behind you because they don't want to
show that
we have hundreds of thousands of people
here and i just want them to be
recognized
by the fake news media turn your cameras
please
and show what's really happening out
here because
these people are not going to take it
any longer
they're not going to take it any longer
go ahead turn your cameras please would
you show
they came from all over the world
actually but they came from all over our
country
i just really want to see what they do i
just want to see how they cover it i've
never seen anything like it
but it would be really great if we could
be covered fairly by the media the media
is the biggest problem we have as far as
i'm concerned single biggest
problem the fake news and the big tech
big tech is now coming into their own we
beat them four years ago we surprised
them we took them by surprise and this
year
they rigged an election they rigged it
like they've never rigged an election
before and by the way
they didn't do a bad job either if you
notice
i'm honest just and and i just again i
want to thank you it's uh just a great
honor to have this kind of
crowd and to be before you and
hundreds of thousands of american
patriots are committed to
the honesty of our elections and the
integrity
of our glorious republic all of us here
today do not
want to see our election victory stolen
by emboldened radical left democrats
which is what they're doing
and stolen by the fake news media that's
what they've done and what they're doing
we will never give up we will never
concede it doesn't happen you don't
concede when there's
theft involved
our country has had enough we will not
take it anymore and that's what this is
all about
and to use a favorite term that all of
you people really came up with
we will stop the steal
i will lay out just some of the evidence
proving that we won this election
and we won it by a landslide this was
not a close election
you know i say sometimes jokingly but
there's no
joke about it i've been in two elections
i won them both and the second one
i won much bigger than the first okay
almost 75 million people voted for our
campaign the most of
any incumbent president by far in the
history of our country
12 million more people
than four years ago
and i was told by the real pollsters we
do have real pulsers they know that
we were going to do well and we were
going to win but i was told if i went
from 63 million which we had
four years ago to 66 million
there was no chance of losing well we
didn't go to 66
we went to 75 million and they say we
lost we didn't lose
and by the way does anybody believe that
joe
had 80 million votes does anybody
believe that
he had 80 million computer votes
it's a disgrace there's never been
anything like that
you could take third world countries
just take a look take
third world countries their elections
are more honest than what we've been
going through in this country
it's a disgrace it's a disgrace
you look at last night they're all
running around like chickens with their
heads cut off with
boxes and nobody knows what the hell is
going on there's never been anything
like this
we will not let them silence your voices
we're not going to let it happen
not going to let it happen
thank you
and i'd love to have if those tens of
thousands of people would be allowed
the military the secret service and we
want to thank you and the police law
enforcement great you're doing a great
job
but i'd love it if they could be allowed
to come up here with us
is that possible can you just let them
come up please
and rudy you did a great job
he's got guts you know what he's got
guts unlike a lot of people in the
republican party
he's got guts he fights he fights ed
i'll talk thank you very much john
fantastic job i watched
that's a tough act to follow those two
john is one of the most brilliant
lawyers in the country and he looked at
this and he said
what an absolute disgrace that this
could be happening to our constitution
and he looked at mike pence and i hope
mike is going to do the right thing i
hope so
i hope so because if mike pence does the
right thing
we win the election all he has to do
all in this is this is from the number
one or certainly one of the top
constitutional lawyers in our country he
has the absolute right to do it
we're supposed to protect our country
support our country
support our constitution and protect our
constitution
states want to revoke the states
got defrauded they were given false
information
they voted on it now they want to
recertify they want it back
all vice president pen do is send it
back to the states
to recertify and we become
president and you are the happiest
people
and i actually i just spoke to mike
i said mike that doesn't take courage
what takes courage
is to do nothing that takes courage
and then we're stuck with a president
who lost the election by a lot
and we have to live with that for four
more years we're just not going to let
that happen
many of you have traveled from all
across the nation
to be here and i want to thank you for
the extraordinary love that's what it is
there's never been a movement like this
ever ever
for the extraordinary love for this
amazing country
and this amazing movement thank you
by the way this goes all the way back
past the washington monument do you
believe this look at this
unfortunately they gave the press
the prime seats i can't stand that
no but you look at that behind i wish
they'd flip those cameras and look
behind you
that is the most amazing sight
when they make a mistake you get to see
it on television
amazing all the way back
and don't worry we will not take the
name off
the washington monument we will now
cancel culture
you know they wanted to get rid of the
jefferson memorial
either take it down or just put somebody
else in there i don't think that's going
to happen
it damn well better not although with
this administration if this happens
it could happen you'll see some really
bad things happen
they'll knock out lincoln too by the way
they've been taking his statue down but
then we signed a little law
you hurt our monuments you hurt our
heroes you go to jail for 10 years and
everything stopped you notice that
it stopped it all stopped
and they could use rudy back in new york
city rudy
they could use you your city's going to
hell
they want rudy giuliani back in new york
we'll get a little younger version of
rudy is that okay rudy
we're gathered together in the heart of
our nation's capital for one
very very basic and simple reason
to save our democracy
you know most candidates on election
evening and of course
this thing goes on so long i don't have
any idea what the votes are we still
have congressional seats
under review they have no idea they've
totally lost control
they've used the pandemic as a way of
defrauding the people
in a proper election but you know
you know when you see this and when you
see what's happening
number one they all say sir we'll never
let it happen again i said that's good
but what about eight weeks ago you know
they try and get you to go
they say sir in four years you're
guaranteed i said i'm not interested
right now do me a favor go back
eight weeks i want to go back eight
weeks let's go back eight weeks
we want to go back and we want to get
this right because we're gonna have
somebody in there that should not be in
there and our country
will be destroyed and we're not going to
stand for that
for years democrats have gotten away
with election fraud and
weak republicans and that's what they
are there's so many weak republicans and
we have great ones jim jordan and some
of these guys they're out there fighting
the house guys are fighting
but it's uh it's incredible many of the
republicans i helped them get in i
helped them
get elected i helped mitch get elected
i helped i could name
24 of them
i won't bore you with it and then all of
a sudden you have something like this
that is like oh
gee maybe i'll talk to the president
sometime later
no it's amazing the weak republicans
they're pathetic republicans and that's
what happens
if this happened to the democrats
there'd be hell all over the country
going on
there'd be hell all over the country but
just remember this
you're stronger you're smarter you've
got more going than anybody
and they try and demean everybody having
to do with us
and you're the real people you're the
people that built this nation
you're not the people that tore down our
nation
the weak republicans and that's it i
really believe it i think i'm going to
use the term the weak
republicans you've got a lot of them and
you've got a lot of great ones but
you've got a lot of weak ones
they've turned to bly eye even as
democrats enacted policies
that shipped away our jobs weakened our
military
threw open our borders and put america
last
did you see the other day where joe
biden said i want to get rid of the
america first policy what's that all
about get rid of
how do you say i want to get rid of
america
even if you're going to do it don't talk
about it right
unbelievable what we have to go through
what we have to go through and you have
to get your people
to fight and if they don't fight we have
to primary the hell out of the ones that
don't fight
you primary them we're gonna we're gonna
let you know who they are
i can already tell you frankly but this
year using the pretext of the china
virus and the scam of
mail-in ballots democrats attempted the
most brazen and outrageous election
theft and there's never been anything
like this it's a pure theft
in american history everybody knows it
that election
our election was over at ten o'clock in
the evening
we're leading pennsylvania michigan
georgia by hundreds of thousands of
votes
and then late in the evening or early in
the morning
boom these explosions of
and all of a sudden
all of a sudden it started to happen
don't forget when romney got beat romney
did you see his
i wonder if he enjoyed his flight in
last night
but when romney got you know he stands
up like
you're more typical to congratulate
the victoria the victor who is the
victor mitt
i'd like to congratulate they don't go
and look at the facts no i don't know
he got he got slaughtered probably maybe
it was okay
maybe it was that's what happened but we
look at the facts
and our election was so corrupt that in
the history of this country we've never
seen anything like it you can go all the
way back
you know america is blessed with
elections all over the world they talk
about our elections you know what the
world says about us now
they say we don't have free and fair
elections and you know what else we
don't have a free
and fair press our media is not free
it's not fair it suppresses thought
it suppresses speech and it's become
the enemy of the people it's become the
enemy
of the people it's a it's the biggest
problem we have in this country
no third world countries would even
attempt
to do what we caught them doing
and you'll hear about that in just a few
minutes republicans are
republicans are constantly fighting
and we want to be so nice
we want to be so respectful of everybody
including
bad people and we're going to have to
fight much harder
and mike pence is going to have to come
through for us and if he doesn't
that will be a sad day for our country
because you're sworn to uphold
our constitution
now it is up to congress to confront
this egregious assault
on our democracy and after this
we're going to walk down and i'll be
there with you we're going to walk down
we're going to walk down anyone you want
but
and we're going to cheer on our brave
senators and congressmen and women
and we're probably not going to be
cheering so much for
some of them because you'll
never take back our country with
weakness
you have to show strength and you have
to be strong
we have come to demand that congress
do the right thing and only count the
electors who have been lawfully
slated lawfully slated
i know that everyone here will soon be
marching over to the capitol building
to peacefully and patriotically make
your voices heard
today we will see whether republicans
stand strong
for integrity of our elections
but whether or not they stand strong for
our country
our country our country has been under
siege
for a long time far longer than this
four-year period
we on a much straighter course a much
and we
i thought you know four more years i
thought it would be easy
we created the greatest economy in
history we rebuilt our military we get
you
the biggest tax cuts in history right we
got you the biggest regulation cuts
there's no president whether it's four
years eight years or in one case more
got anywhere near the regulation cut she
used to take 20 years to get a highway
approved
now we're down to two i want to get it
down to one
but we're down to two and it may get
rejected for environmental or safety
reasons
but we got it down to safety we created
space force we
look at what we did our military has
been totally rebuilt
so we create space force which by and of
itself
is a major achievement for an
administration
and with us it's one of so many
different things
right to try everybody know about right
to try we did things
that nobody ever thought possible we
took care of our vets
our vets the va now has the highest
rating 91
the highest rating that it's had
from the beginning 91 approval rating
always you watch the va it was on
television every night people
living in a horrible horrible manner
we got that done we got accountability
done
we got it so that now in the va you
don't have to wait for four weeks six
weeks eight weeks
four months to see a doctor if you can't
get a doctor you go
outside you get the doctor you have them
taken care of
and we pay the doctor and we've not only
made life wonderful for so many people
we've saved tremendous amounts of money
far secondarily but we've saved a lot of
money
and now we have the right to fire bad
people in the va we had 9 000 people
that treated our veterans horribly
in prime time they would not have
treated our veterans badly
but they treated our veterans horribly
and we have what's called the account of
a va
accountability act and the
accountability
says if we see somebody in there that
treat our vets well or they steal
they rob they do things badly we say joe
you're fired get out of here before you
couldn't do that
you couldn't do that before so we've
taken care of things we've done things
like nobody's ever thought possible
and that's part of the reason that many
people don't like us
because we've done too much but we've
done it quickly and
we were going to sit home and watch a
big victory and everybody had us down
for a victory it was going to be great
and now we're out here fighting i said
to somebody i was going to take a few
days
and relax after our big electoral
victory
10 o'clock it was over but i was going
to take a few days and i can say this
since our election i believe
which was such a catastrophe when i
watched and even these guys knew what
happened they know what happened
they're saying wow pennsylvania's
insurmountable
wow wisconsin look at the big leads we
had right even though the press said
we're going to lose wisconsin by 17
points
even though the press said ohio is going
to be close we set a record
florida's going to be close we set a
record texas is going to be close
texas is going to be close we set a
record and we set a record with hispanic
with the black community we set a record
with everybody
today we see a very important event
though because right over there
right there we see the event going to
take place
and i'm going to be watching because
history is going to be made
we're going to see whether or not we
have great and courageous leaders or
whether or not
we have leaders that should be ashamed
of themselves
throughout history throughout eternity
they'll be ashamed
and you know what if they do the wrong
thing
we should never ever forget that they
did
never forget we should never ever forget
with only three of the seven states in
question
we win the presidency of the united
states
and by the way it's much more important
today
than it was 24 hours ago because and
don't
i spoke to david perdue what a great
person and kelly lefler two great people
but it was a setup and you know i said
no backline anymore the only back line
the only
line of demarcation the only line that
we have
is the veto of the president of the
united states
so this is now what we're doing a far
more important election than it was two
days ago
i want to thank the more than 140
members of the house those are warriors
they're over there working like you've
never seen before
studying talking actually going all the
way back
studying the roots of the constitution
because they know we have the right to
send a bad vote
that was illegally gotten they gave
these people
bad things to vote for and they voted
because what did they know and then when
they found out a few weeks later
again it took them four years to devise
this screen
and the only unhappy person in the
united states single most unhappy
is hillary clinton because she said why
didn't you do this for me four years
ago why didn't you do this for me four
years ago
changed the votes ten thousand in
michigan
you could have changed the whole thing
but uh she's not too happy you notice
she
you don't see her anymore what happened
where's hillary
where is she but i want to thank all of
those congressmen
and women i also want to thank our 13
most courageous members of the u.s
senate senator
senator ron johnson senator josh hawley
kelly lafleur and kelly lefla i'll tell
you she has been
she's been so great she worked so hard
so
let's give her and david a little
special head because it was rigged
against him let's give
her and david kelly left david perdue
they fought a good race they never had a
shot
that equipment should never have been
allowed to be used and i was telling
these people
don't let them use this stuff marsha
blackburn terrific person mike braun
indiana
steve danes great guy bill hagerty
john kennedy james lankford cynthia
lumps
tommy tuberville to the coach and roger
marshall we want to thank them senators
have stepped up we want to thank them
i actually think though it takes again
more courage
not to step up and i think a lot of
those people are going to find that out
and you better start looking at your
leadership because your leadership has
led you down the tubes
you know we don't want to give two
thousand dollars to people we want to
give them six hundred dollars oh great
how does that play politically pretty
good and this has nothing to do with
politics
play politically china
destroyed these people we didn't disrupt
china destroyed them totally destroyed
them we want to give them six hundred
dollars
and they just wouldn't change i said
give them two thousand dollars
we'll pay it back we'll pay it back fast
you already owe 26 trillion give them a
couple of bucks let them live
give them a couple of bucks
and some of the people here disagree
with me on that but i i just say
look you got to let people live and how
does that play though okay number one
it's the right thing to do
but how does that play politically i
think it's the primary reason one of the
primary reasons
the other was just pure cheating that
was the primary super primary reason
but you can't do that got to use your
head as you know the media has
constantly asserted the outrageous lie
that there was
no evidence of widespread food you ever
see these people
while there is no evidence of fraud or
really
well i'm going to read you pages i hope
you don't get bored listening to it
promise
don't get bored listening to it all
those hundreds of thousands of people
back there
move them up please yeah all the
all these people don't get bored don't
get angry at me because you're going to
get bored
because it's so much the american people
do not believe
fake news anymore they have ruined their
reputation
but you know it used to be that they'd
argue with me i'd fight so i'd fight
they'd fight i'd fight they'd fight
bullpup you'd believe me you'd believe
them somebody comes out you know
they had their point of view i had my
point of view but you'd have an argument
now what they do is they go silent it's
called suppression
and that's what happens in a communist
country
that's what they do they suppress you
don't fight with them anymore
unless it's a bad serve they have a
little bad story about me they make it
ten times worse and it's a major
headline
but hunter biden they don't talk about
him what happened to hunter where's
hunter
where's hunter they don't talk about him
now watch all the sets will go off well
they can't do that because they get good
ratings
their ratings are too good now where's
hunter
you know and and how come joe was
allowed to
give a billion dollars of money to get
rid of the prosecutor in ukraine how
does that
happen i'd ask you that question how
does that happen
can you imagine if i said that if i said
that it would be a whole different
ballgame
and how come hunter gets three
million dollars from the mayor of
moscow's wife
and gets hundreds of thousands of
dollars to sit on an energy board even
though he admits he has
no knowledge of energy and millions of
dollars up front
and how come they go into china and they
leave with billions of dollars to manage
have you managed money before no i
haven't oh that's good here's about 3
billion
no they don't talk about that no we have
a corrupt media
they've gone silent they've gone dead i
now realize how good
it was if you go back 10 years i
realized
how good even though i didn't
necessarily
love them i realized how good it was
like a cleansing motion right
but we don't have that anymore we don't
have
a fair media anymore it's suppression
and you have to be very careful with
that
and they've lost all credibility in this
country we will not
be intimidated into accepting the
hoaxes and the lies that
we've been forced to believe over the
past several weeks we've amassed
overwhelming evidence about a fake
election
this is the presidential election last
night was a little bit better because of
the fact that we had a lot of eyes
watching one specific
was in the united states and you know
when i
endorsed him i didn't know this guy at
the request of david perdue he said
a friend of mine is running for governor
what's his name
and you know the rest he was in fourth
place
fifth place i don't know he was wait he
was doing poorly
i endorsed him he went like a rocket
ship that he won
and then i had to beat stacey abrams
with this guy
brian kemp i had to beat stacy abrams
and i had to beat oprah used to be a
friend of mine you know i was on her
last show or last week
she picked the five outstanding people i
don't think she thinks that anymore
once i ran for president i didn't notice
there were too many calls coming in from
oprah
believe it or not she used to like me
but i was one of the five outstanding
people
and i had a campaign against michelle
obama and barack hussein obama
against stacy and i had brian
kemp he weighs 130 pounds he said he
played offensive line in football i'm
trying to figure that out
i'm still trying to figure that out so
that the
offensive lineman i'm saying really that
must have been a very small team
but i look at that and i look at what's
happened
and he turned out to be a disaster this
stuff happens you know
look i'm not happy with the supreme
court they love to rule
against me i picked three people
i fought like hell for him one in
particular i thought
they all said sir cut him loose he's
killing the senators you know very loyal
senators they're very loyal people
sir cut him loose he's killing us sir
cut him loose sir nev i must have gotten
half of the senators i said no i can't
do that it's unfair to him and it's
unfair to the family
he didn't do anything wrong they made up
stories they were all made made-up
stories he didn't do anything wrong
caught a blue sir i said no i won't do
that we got them through
and you know what they couldn't give a
damn they couldn't give a damn
let them rule the right way but it
almost seems that they're all going out
of their way to hurt all of us
and to hurt our country to hurt our
country
you know i read a story in one of the
newspapers recently
how i control the three supreme court
justices
told them they're puppets i read it
about bill barr that he's my personal
attorney
that he'll do anything for me and i said
you know it really is
genius because what they do is that and
it makes it really impossible for them
to ever give you a victory
because all of a sudden billboard
changed if you hadn't noticed
i like bill barr but he changed because
he didn't want to be considered my
personal attorney
and the supreme court they rule against
me so much you know why
because the story is i haven't spoken to
any of them
any of them since virtually they got in
but the story is
that they're my puppet right that
they're puppets
and now the only way they can get out of
that because they hate that it's not
good on the social circuit
and the only way they get out is to rule
against trump
so let's rule against trump and they do
that so i want to congratulate them
but it shows you the media's genius
in fact probably if i was the media i'd
do it the same way i hate to say it
but we got to get them straightened out
today for the sake of our democracy
for the sake of our constitution and for
the sake of our children
we lay out the case for the entire world
to hear
do you want to hear it in every single
swing state
local officials state officials almost
all democrats made
illegal and unconstitutional changes
to election procedures without the
mandated approvals by the state
legislatures
that these changes pave the way for
fraud or to scale
never seen before and i think we can go
a long way outside of our country when i
say that
so just in a nutshell you can't make a
change
on voting for a federal election unless
the state legislature approves it no
judge can do it nobody can do it only a
legislature
so as an example in pennsylvania or
whatever
you have a republican legislature you
have a democrat mayor
and you have a lot of democrats all over
the place they go to the legislature
the legislature laughs at them says
we're not going to do that
they say thank you very much then they
go and make the
way changes that's totally illegal
that's totally illegal you can't do that
in pennsylvania the democrat secretary
of state
and the democrat state supreme court
justices
illegally abolished the signature
verification requirements
just 11 days prior to the election so
think of what they did
no longer is there signature
verification oh that's okay
we want voter id by the way but no
longer
is there signature verification 11 days
before the election they say we don't
want it
you know why they don't want to because
they want to cheat
that's the only reason who would even
think of that we don't want to verify a
signature
there were over 205 000 more ballots
counted
in pennsylvania now think of this you
had 205
000 more ballots
than you had voters that means you had
two
where did they come from you know where
they came from somebody's imagination
whatever they needed
so in pennsylvania you had 205
000 more votes than you had voters
and it's the number is actually much
greater than that now
that was as of a week ago and this is a
mathematical impossibility
unless you want to say it's a total
fraud so pennsylvania was defrauded
over 8 000 ballots in pennsylvania were
cast by people
whose names and dates of birth match
individuals who died
in 2020 and prior to the election
think of that dead people lots of dead
people thousands
and some dead people actually requested
an application that bothers me
not only are they voting they want an
application to vote one of them was 29
years ago died
it's incredible over 14 000 ballots were
cast
by out of state voters so these are
voters that don't live in the state
and by the way these numbers are
what they call outcome determinative
meaning these numbers far surpass i lost
by a very little bit
these numbers are massive massive more
than 10
000 votes in pennsylvania
were illegally counted even though they
were received
after election words
they were received after election day
let's count them anyway
and what they did in many cases is they
did fraud
they took the date and they moved it
back so that it no longer
is after election day and more than 60
000 ballots in pennsylvania
were reported received back they got
back
before they were ever supposedly mailed
out in other words you got the ballot
back before you mailed it
which is also
logically and logistically impossible
right think of that one you got the
ballot back let's send the ballot so
they've already been sent
but we got the ballot back before they
were sent i don't think that's too good
right
25 000 ballots in pennsylvania were
requested by nursing home residents
all in a single giant batch not legal
indicating an enormous illegal ballot
harvesting operation
you're not allowed to do it it's against
the law the day before the election the
state of pennsylvania reported the
number of absentee ballots
that had been sent out yet this number
was suddenly and drastically
increased by 400
000 people it was increased
nobody knows where it came from by 400
000 ballots
one day after the election it remains
totally unexplained they said well we
can't uh
figure that now that's many many times
what it would take to overthrow the
state just that one element
400 000 ballots appeared from nowhere
right after the election by the way
pennsylvania
has now seen all of this they didn't
know because it was so quick
they had a vote they voted but now they
see all this stuff it's all come to life
it doesn't happen that fast and they
want to
re-certify their votes they want to
re-certify
but the only way that can happen is if
mike pence agrees to send it back
mike pence has to agree to send it back
and many people in congress want to send
back and think of what you're doing
let's say you don't do it somebody says
well we have to obey the constitution
and you are
because you're protecting our country
and you're protecting the constitution
so you are
but think of what happens let's say
they're stiffs
and they're stupid people say well we
really have no choice
even though pennsylvania and other
states want to redo
their votes they want to see the numbers
they already have the numbers
go very quickly and they want to redo
their legislature
because many of these votes were taken
as i said because it wasn't approved by
their legislature you know
that in itself is legal and then you
have the scam
and that's all of the things that we're
talking about but think of this
if you don't do that that means you will
have
a president of the united states for
four years with his wonderful son
you will have a president
who lost all of these states or
you will have a president to put it
another way who
was voted on by a bunch of stupid people
who lost all of these states you will
have an illegitimate president that's
what you'll have
and we can't let that happen these are
the facts
that you won't hear from the fake news
media it's all part of the
suppression effort they don't want to
talk about it they don't want to talk
about it
in fact when i started talking to
guarantee you a lot of the television
sets
and a lot of those cameras went off and
that's a lot of cameras back there
but a lot of them went off but these are
the things you don't
hear about you don't hear what you just
heard i'm going to go over
a few more states but you don't hear it
by the people
who want to deceive you and demoralize
you and control you
big tech media just like the suppression
polls that said
we're going to lose wisconsin by 17
points well we won wisconsin
they don't have it that way because they
lost just by a little sliver
but they had me down the day before
washington post abc paul
down 17 points i called up a real
pollster i said what is that
sir that's called a suppression poll i
think you're going to win wisconsin sir
i said but why don't they make it four
or five points because then people vote
but when you're down 17 they say hey i'm
not going to waste my time i love the
president but there's no way
despite that despite that we won
wisconsin it's going to see i mean
you'll see
but that's called suppression because a
lot of people when they see that
it's very interesting this pulsar said
sir if you're down three four five
when you go down 17 they say let's save
let's go and have dinner and
let's watch the presidential defeat
tonight on television darling
and just like the radical left tries to
blacklist you
on social media every time i put out a
tweet
that's even if it's totally correct
totally correct
i get a flag i get a flag
and they also don't let you get out you
know on twitter it's very hard to come
onto my account
it's very hard to get out a message they
don't let the message get out
nearly like they should but i've had
many people say i can't get on your
twitter
i don't care about twitter twitter's bad
news they're all bad news
but you know what if you want to if you
want to get out a message
and if you want to go through big tech
social media
they are really if you're a conservative
if you're a republican if you have a big
voice
i guess they call it shadow band right
shadow band they shadow ban
you and it should be illegal
i've been telling these republicans get
rid of section 230
and for some reason mitch and the group
they don't want to put it in there
and they don't that that's going to be
the end of the republican party as we
know it but it's never going to be the
end of us
never let them get out let
let the weak ones get out this is a time
for strength
they also want to indoctrinate your
children in school
by teaching them things that aren't so
they want to indoctrinate your children
it's all part of the
comprehensive assault on our democracy
and the american people are finally
standing up
and saying no this crowd is again a
testament to it i did no advertising i
did nothing
you do have some groups that are big
supporters i want to thank that amy and
everybody
we have some incredible supporters
incredible
but we didn't do anything this just
happened two months ago
we had a massive crowd come down to
washington i said what are they there
for
sir they're there for you we have
nothing to do with it
these groups are for they're forming all
over the united states
and we've got to remember in a year from
now you're going to start working on
congress and we got to get rid of the
weak congress people the ones that
aren't any good
the liz cheney's of the world we got to
get rid of them
we got to get rid you know she never
wants
her home 20 i brought a lot of our
soldiers home
i don't know somewhat like it they're in
countries
that nobody even knows the name nobody
knows where they are
they're dying they're great but they're
dying
they're losing their arms their legs
their face
i brought them back home largely back
home afghanistan
iraq remember i used to say in the old
days don't go in iraq but if you go and
keep the oil we didn't keep the oil
so stupid so stupid these people
and iraq has billions and billions of
dollars now in the bank
and what did we do we get nothing we
never get
but we do actually we kept the oil here
okay we did good
we got rid of the isis caliphate
we got rid of plenty of different things
that everybody knows and the rebuilding
of our military in three years people
said it couldn't be done
and it was all made in the usa all made
in the usa
best equipment in the world in wisconsin
corrupt democrat-run cities deployed
more than 500 illegal
unmanned unsecured drop boxes which
collected a minimum of 19
000 unlawful votes it was razor thin the
loss
this one thing alone is much more than
we would need
but there are many things they have
these lock boxes and you know they pick
them up and they disappear for two days
people would say where's that box
that disappeared nobody even knew where
the hell it was
in addition over 170 000 absentee votes
were counted in wisconsin without a
valid absentee ballot application so
they had a vote but they had no
application
and that's illegal in wisconsin meaning
those votes were blatantly
done in opposition to state law
and they came 100 from democrat areas
such as
milwaukee and madison
100 percent in madison 17
000 votes were deposited in so-called
human drop boxes you know what that is
right where operatives stuff
thousands of unsecured ballots into
duffel bags
on park benches across the city in
complete defiance of cease and desist
letters from state
legislature your state legislature said
don't do it they're the only ones that
can approve it
they gave tens of thousands of votes
they came in in duffel bags
where the hell did they come from
according to eyewitness testimony
service workers in wisconsin were also
instructed to illegally back date
approximately
100 000 ballots the margin of difference
in wisconsin was less than 20 000 votes
each one of these things alone wins us
the state
great state we love the state we won the
state
in georgia your secretary of state
who i can't believe this guy's a
republican he loves recording telephone
conversations you know
that was a i thought it was a great
conversation personally
so did a lot of people love that
conversation
because it says what's going on these
people are crooked
they're 100 in my opinion one of the
most corrupt
between your governor and your secretary
of state and now you have it again last
night just take a look at what happened
what a mess
and the democrat party operators entered
into an illegal
and unconstitutional unconstitutional
settlement agreement
that drastically weakened signature
verification and other
election security procedures stacey
abrams
she took them to lunch and i beat her
two years ago with a bad candidate brian
kemp
but they took the democrats took
the republicans to lunch because the
secretary of state
had no clue what the hell was happening
unless he did have a clue that's
interesting
maybe he was with the other side but
we've been trying to get
verifications of signatures in
fulton county they won't let us do it
the only reason they won't
is because we'll find things in the
hundreds of thousands
why wouldn't they let us verify
signatures in fulton county
which is known for being very corrupt
they won't do it
they go to some other county where you
would live i said that's not the problem
the problem is fulton county home of
stacy abrams she did a good job i
congratulate her but it was
done in such a way that we can't let
this stuff happen
we won't have a country if it happens as
a result george's absencey ballot
rejection rate
was more than 10 times lower than
previous levels
because the criteria was so
off 48 counties in georgia
with thousands and thousands of votes
rejected zero ballots wasn't one ballot
in other words in a year in which more
mail-in ballots were sent than ever
before
and more people were voting by mail for
the first time
the rejection rate was drastically lower
than it had ever been before
the only way this can be explained is if
tens of thousands of illegitimate votes
were added to the tally that's the only
way you could explain it
by the way you're talking about tens of
thousands
if georgia had merely rejected the same
number of unlawful
ballots as in other years there should
have been approximately 45
000 ballots rejected far more
than what we needed to win just over 11
000 they should find those votes
they should absolutely find that
just over 11 000 votes that's all we
need
they defrauded us out of a win in
georgia and we're not going to forget it
there's only one reason the democrats
could possibly want to eliminate
signature matching oppose voter id
and stop citizenship confirmation are
you a citizenship you're not allowed to
ask that question
because they want to steal the election
the radical left knows exactly what
they're doing
they're ruthless and it's time that so
something about it and mike pence i hope
you're going to stand up
for the good of our constitution and for
the
good of our country and if you're not
i'm going to be very disappointed in you
i will tell you right now
i'm not hearing good stories in fulton
county republican poll watchers were
ejected
in some cases physically from the room
under the false pretense of a pipe burst
water main burst
everybody leave which we now know was a
total lie
then election officials pull boxes
democrats
and suitcases of ballots out from under
a table you all saw it on television
totally fraudulent
and illegally scanned them for nearly
two hours totally unsupervised
tens of thousands of votes this act
coincided with a mysterious vote dump
of up to 100 000 votes for joe biden
almost none for trump oh that sounds
fair
that was at 1 34 a.m
the georgia secretary of state and
pathetic
governor of georgia have reached
although he says i'm a great president
you know
i sort of maybe have to change he said
the other day
i disagree with president but he's been
a great president oh good thanks
thank you very much because of him and
others yeah brian kemp vote him the hell
out of office please
well his rates are so low you know his
approval rating now
i think it just reached a record low
they've rejected five separate appeals
for an independent and comprehensive
audit of signatures in fulton county
even without an order the number of
fraudulent ballots that we've identified
across the state
is staggering over ten thousand three
hundred ballots in georgia were cast by
individuals
whose names and dates at birth match
georgia residents who died
in 2020 and prior to the election
more than 2 500 ballots were cast by
individuals
whose names and dates of birth match
incarcerated felons in georgia prison
people who are not allowed to vote
more than 4 500 illegal ballots were
cast by individuals who do not appear
on the state's own voter rolls over 18
000 illegal ballots were cast by
individuals who registered to vote
using an address listed as vacant
according to the postal service
at least 88 000 ballots
were cast by people whose registrations
were illegally
backdated 66 000 votes each one of these
is far
more than we need 66 000 votes in
georgia were cast by individuals
under the legal voting age and at least
15 000 ballots were cast by individuals
who moved out of the state prior to
november third election
they say they moved right back they
moved right back oh they moved out they
move right back
okay they miss george's that much i do i
love georgia
but it's a corrupt system despite all of
this the margin
a victory in georgia a big beautiful
victory
make no mistake this election was stolen
from you
from me and from the country and not a
single swing state has conducted a
comprehensive audit
to remove the illegal ballots this
should absolutely occur in every single
contested state before the election is
certified
in the state of arizona over 36 000
ballots were illegally cast by
non-citizens
2 000 ballots were returned with no
address
more than 22 000 ballots were returned
before they were
supposedly mailed out they returned but
we haven't mailed them yet
11 600 more ballots and votes were
counted
more than there were actual voters you
see that so you have
more votes again than you have voters
150
000 people registered in maya copa
county
after the registration deadline 103
000 ballots in the county were sent for
electronic adjudication with no
republican observers
in clark county nevada the accuracy
settings on signature verification
machines
were purposely lowered before they were
used
to count over 100 130 000 ballots
if you signed your name as santa claus
it would go through
there were also more than 42 000 double
votes in nevada
over and 150 thousand
people were hurt so badly
by what took place and fifteen hundred
ballots were cast by
individuals whose names and dates of
birth matched nevada residents
who died in 2020 prior to november third
election
more than 8 000 votes were cast by
individuals
had no address and probably didn't live
there
the margin in nevada is down at a very
low number any of these things would
have taken care of the situation
we would have won nevada also every one
of these were going over we win
in michigan quickly the secretary of
state a real
great one flooded the state with
unsolicited mail-in valid applications
sent to every person on the rolls
in direct violation of state law more
than 17
000 michigan ballots were cast by
individuals whose names and dates at
birth
match people who were deceased in wayne
county
that's a great one that's detroit
174 000 ballots were counted without
being tied to an
actual registered voter nobody knows
where they came from
also in wayne county poll watches
observed
canvassers rescanning batches of ballots
over and over again
up to three or four or five times in
detroit turnout
was 139 percent of registered voters
think of that
so you had 139 percent of the people in
detroit voting
this is in michigan detroit michigan a
career employee of the detroit
city of detroit testified under penalty
of perjury that she witnessed city
workers coaching voters to vote
straight democrat accompanying them to
watch
who they voted for when a republican
came in they wouldn't talk to him
the same worker was instructed not to
ask
for any voter id and not to attempt to
validate any signatures
if they were democrats she also told to
illegally and was told
back date ballots received after the
deadline and reports that thousands and
thousands of ballots
were improperly backdated that's
michigan
four witnesses have testified under
penalty of perjury
that after officials in detroit
announced the last votes
had been counted tens of thousands of
additional ballots arrive
without required envelopes every single
one
was for a democrat i got no votes
at 6 31 a.m in the early morning hours
after
voting had ended michigan subtly
reported 147
000 votes an astounding 94 percent went
to joe biden
who campaigned brilliantly from his
basement
only a couple of percentage points went
to trump
such gigantic and one-sided vote dumps
were only observed in a few swing states
and they were observations where it was
necessary you know what's interesting
president obama beat biden
in every state other than the swing
states where biden killed them but the
swing states were the ones that mattered
they're always just enough to push joe
biden barely into the lead we were ahead
by a lot
and within the number of hours we were
losing by a little
in addition there is the highly
troubling matter of dominion voting
systems
in one michigan county alone 6 000 votes
were switched
from trump to biden and the same systems
are used
in the majority of states in our country
senator william
liggin a great gentleman chairman of
georgia senate judiciary subcommittee
senator liggin highly respected on
elections has written a letter
describing his concerns with dominion in
georgia
he wrote and i quote the dominion voting
machines
employed in fulton county had an
astronomical and astounding 93.67
error rate it's only wrong 93 of the
time
in the scanning of ballots requiring a
review panel to adjudicate or determine
the voters interest
over 106 000 ballots out of a total of
113
000. think of it you go in and you vote
and then they tell people who you're
supposed to be voting for they
make up whatever they want nobody's ever
even heard they adjudicate your vote
they say well we don't think trump wants
to vote for trump
we think he wants to vote for biden put
it down for mine the national average
for such an error rate
is far less than one percent and yet
you're at 93
the source of this astronomical error
rate must be identified to determine
if these machines were set up or
destroyed to allow for a third party to
disregard
the actual ballot cast by the registered
voter
the letter continues there is clear
evidence that tens of thousands of votes
were switched from president trump to
former vice president biden
in several counties in georgia for
example in bibb county president trump
was reported to have 29
391 votes at 9
11 p.m eastern time while simultaneously
vice president
joe biden was reported f-17 213.
minutes later just minutes at the next
update these vote numbers
switched with president trump going way
down to 17
000 and biden going way up to twenty
nine thousand three ninety one
and that was very quick a twelve
thousand vote switch
all in mr biden's favor so i mean i
could go on and on
about this fraud that took place in
every state
and all of these legislatures want this
back
i don't want to do it to you because i
love you and it's freezing out here
but i could just go on forever i can
tell you
this
so when you hear when you hear
while there is no evidence to prove any
wrongdoing
this is the most fraudulent thing
anybody said this is a criminal
enterprise
this is a criminal enterprise and and
the press will say
and i'm sure they won't put any of that
on there because that's no good
and you ever see there's no evidence
to back president trump's assertion i
could go on for
another hour reading this stuff to you
and telling you about
it there's never been anything like it
think about it
detroit had more votes than it had
voters
pennsylvania had 205 000
more votes than it had more you don't
have to go any
that between that i think that's almost
better than dead people if you think
right more votes than they had voters
and many other states also
it's a disgrace that the united states
of america
tens of millions of people are allowed
to go vote
without so much as even showing
identification
in no state is there any question
or effort made to verify the identity
citizenship
residency or eligibility of the votes
cast
the republicans have to get tougher
you're not going to have a republican
party if you don't get tougher
they want to play so straight they want
to play so sir yes the united states
the constitution doesn't allow me to
send them back to the states
well i say yes it does because the
constitution is you have to protect our
country
and you have to protect our constitution
and you can't vote on fraud
and fraud breaks up everything doesn't
it when you catch somebody in a fraud
you're allowed to go by very different
rules
so i hope mike has the courage to do
what he has to do
and i hope he doesn't listen to the
rhinos and the stupid people that he's
listening to
it is also widely understood that the
voter roles are
crammed full of non-citizens felons and
people who have moved out of state
and individuals who are otherwise
ineligible to vote
yet democrats oppose every effort to
clean up their voter rolls they don't
want to clean them up
they're loaded and how many people here
know other people that when the hundreds
of thousands and then millions of
ballots got sent out
got three four five six and i heard one
who got seven ballots
and then they say you didn't quite make
it sir
uh we we won in a landslide this was a
landslide
they said it's not american to challenge
the election this is the most corrupt
election in the history maybe of the
world
you know you could go third world
countries but i don't
hundreds of thousands of votes and they
don't have voters for them i mean no
matter where you go
nobody would think this in fact it's so
egregious it's so bad that a lot of
people don't even believe it
it's so crazy that people don't even
believe it it can't be true
so they don't believe it this is not
just a matter of
domestic politics this is a matter of
national security
so today in addition to challenging the
certification of the election i'm
calling on congress and the state
legislatures
to quickly pass sweeping election
reforms and you better do it before we
have no country left
today is not the end it's just the
beginning
with your help over the last four years
we built the greatest political movement
in the history of our country and nobody
even challenges that
i say that over and over and i never get
challenged by the fake news
and they challenge almost everything we
say but our fight against the big donors
big media big tech and others
is just getting started this is the
greatest in history there's never been a
movement like that you look back there
all the way
to the washington monument it's hard to
believe
we must stop this deal and then we must
ensure
which outrageous election fraud never
happens again can never be allowed to
happen again
but we're going forward we'll take care
of going forward we got to take care of
going back
don't let them talk okay well we promise
i've had a lot of people
sir you're at 96 for four years
i said i'm not interested right now i'm
interested in right there
with your help we will finally pass
powerful
requirements for voter id you need an id
to cash a check
you need an id to go to a bank to buy
alcohol to drive a car
every person should need to show an id
in order to cast your most important
thing a vote
we will also require proof of american
citizenship in order to vote
in american elections
we just had a good victory in court on
that one actually
we will ban ballot harvesting and
prohibit the use of
unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant
fraud these drop boxes are fraudulent
therefore they get dis they disappear
and then all of a sudden they show up
it's fraudulent we will stop the
practice of universal unsolicited
mail-in balloting we will clean up the
bills that ensure that every single
person who casts a vote
is a citizen of our country a resident
of the state in which they vote
and their vote is cast in a lawful and
honest manner
we will restore the vital civic
tradition
of in-person voting on election day so
that voters can be fully informed when
they make their choice
we will finally hold big tech
accountable and if these people had
courage
and guts they would get rid of section
230 something that no other company no
other person in america
in the world has
all of these tech monopolies are going
to
abuse their power and interfere in our
elections
and it has to be stopped and the
republicans have to get a lot tougher
and so should the democrats
they should be regulated investigated
and brought to justice
under the fullest extent of the law
they're totally breaking the law
together we will drain the washington
swamp
and we will clean up the corruption in
our nation's capital
we have done up on it but you think it's
easy it's a dirty business
it's a dirty business you have a lot of
bad people out there
despite everything we've been through
looking out all over
this country and seeing fantastic crowds
although this i think is our all-time
record
i think you have 250 000 people
250 000 looking out at all the amazing
patriots here today
i have never been more confident in our
nation's future
well i have to say we have to be a
little bit careful that's a nice
statement but we have to be a little
careful with that statement
if we allow this group of people
to illegally take over our country
because it's illegal when the votes
are illegal when the way they got there
is illegal
when the states that vote are given
false and fraudulent
information we are the greatest country
on earth
and we are headed and we're headed in
the right direction you know the wall is
built
we're doing record numbers at the wall
now they want to take down the wall
let's let everyone flow in
that's what everybody flowing
we did a great job in the wall remember
the wall they said it could never be
done one of the largest
infrastructure projects we've ever had
in this country
and it's had a tremendous impact and we
got rid of catch and release we got rid
of all of the stuff that we had to live
with
but now the caravans they think biden's
getting in the caravans are forming
again
they want to come in again and rip off
our country can't let it happen
as this enormous crowd shows we have
truth
and justice on our side we have a deep
and enduring love for
america in our hearts we love our
country we have overwhelming pride in
this great country
and we have it deep in our souls
together we are determined to defend and
preserve government
of the people by the people and for the
people
our brightest days are before us
our greatest achievements still wait i
think one of our great achievements
will be election security because nobody
until
i came along had any idea how corrupt
our elections were
and again most people would stand there
at nine o'clock
in the evening and say i want to thank
you very much
and they go off to some other life but i
said
something's wrong here something's
really wrong can't have happened
and we fight we fight like hell and if
you don't fight like hell
you're not going to have a country
anymore our exciting adventures and
boldest endeavors
have not yet begun my fellow americans
for our movement
for our children and for our beloved
country
and i say this despite all that's
happened
the best is yet to come
so we're going to
we're going to walk down pennsylvania
avenue i love pennsylvania
avenue and we're going to the capitol
and we're going to try
and give the democrats are hopeless
they're never voting for anything
not even one vote but we're going to try
and give
our republicans the weak ones because
the strong ones don't need any of our
help
we're going to try and give them the
kind of pride
boldness that they need to take back our
country
so let's walk down pennsylvania avenue
i want to thank you all god bless you
and god
bless america thank you all for being
here this is incredible thank you very
much
you
