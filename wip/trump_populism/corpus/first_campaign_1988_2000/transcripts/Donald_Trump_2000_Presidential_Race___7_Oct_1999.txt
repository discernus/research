================================================================================

 The Sporatory Committee and will just be seeing what happens. Why do they? But all the polls are showing that I win or do very well in this election. I'm not happy with what's happening in the country. Nobody else is able to spare the whole thing. It's gone. It's just terrible. And so I'm just going to look at it. I look at it very seriously. As you know, I love what I'm doing. I'm having a lot of fun and I'm really happy. But we will see what kind of thing we will see. You've heard the speculation that people say you're not doing this because you're real about it. You do need to stop the tap. I think that you can't escape. In anybody that's in love with it, I'll pick it up. I'm not a big fan of it. And I'm not doing it for that reason. But that you can have it as come out essentially in favor of it. I think it's a disgrace. But you do want to stop it. That's not why you're going to be running it. Why not? On the sea, whether or not you're going to be looking at it and over January February or something, we'll be making it a nice one. What means, and you change the world in the last couple of years? I don't think I've ever changed my mind. As it looked at it for the last couple of months, Poles come out. That say I do very well or when. And I guess we're looking at a good series. What do you think, if you are going to pass me this one, so he doesn't come up with it? There is a speculation that this hurts. Or it's certainly more than a dozen. No, I think if you can and gets in, there will be a very big job. I think that all of those ones who come to bush, I think the one who will grab me will ever be the very world of this question. Thank you very much. I'm going to explore your opinion. I will show them that you need to get a better understanding of what you want to come up with. You'll probably be making a decision in January or February. We'll see what happens. The Poles have come out, they're going to unbelievably strong. They say I win. But we're going to look at it, we're going to look at it very seriously. We'll probably be making a decision in January or February. Sir, look at that. You really did. We're going to have a lot of people looking at this. A lot of very smart people. Right, give me more. All right. I think that's what we'll see in the future. I think a Donald Trump candidacy, or whomever the candidate may be from the reform party is a viable candidate. I think we saw in the past two elections, the influence and the impact that it had. So I do not think the future will be any different. I think you really have to base it on success. I've had very extraordinary success. I've done things that people really said couldn't be done. And when you look at your alternatives, let's not kid ourselves. I looked at Mr. Bush last week, and I looked at Mr. Gore, and I look at other people. And let me ask you, did they make billions of dollars for a short time? I don't think so. Would they be able to? I don't think so. And ultimately, it's all common sense. I mean, what we started with Jorge was all based on a letter. It was a letter from him to me. And I wrote out of common sense something for the Miami Herald. It was printed in the op-ed pages. And we've received thousands of responses as you have. And again, it's based on common sense. But what is the purpose of all of the years of English and harm, and the terrible things that have taken place? If you're just going to lift the embargo and let castles stay in power. So it was based on common sense that hit a chord, and a lot of people like it. Look, the reform party is at a huge disadvantage, no matter who runs. You have the Democrats and the Republicans. For many, many years, they've been there. They've got their systems. They've got their get out the vote. They've got hundreds of other things that the reform party doesn't have, which is a new party, whoever the candidate is for the reform party. And I believe I could be if I decide to go that route. And I may not. I may decide that I don't want to run. But if I decide that I can win, and it isn't disadvantage, there's no question about it. If I decide that I can win, I very well might announce that I will be running. But there's no question about the fact that when you run on the reform party, you obviously don't have the machinery in place over a tremendous number of years that the other two parties do. So how much do you plan to be out on the exchange rate? And what do you think the leader is going to do? What do you want to do? Well, I think if I wanted the reform party nomination, and this is based on knowledge, not just feeling, I think I'd get it. The question is, again, whether I feel that by having the nomination, I can win. I don't want to get 21 percent or 22 percent of the vote and do great and get the most ever and then end up the following Wednesday, back in my office in Trump Tower and say, gee, that was wonderful. But what does it all mean? It doesn't mean anything. It wouldn't mean very much to me. Now, it may mean a lot to some people. It wouldn't mean much to me. To Pat Buchan, and he'll end up back on course fire maybe, maybe. Although I don't think he will personally, but he did last time. He seems to end back up in that show every time he loses. But he's been running forever. It's stas and all over again. And I don't get it. He can't win. He was thrown out of it essentially. He was thrown out of the Republican Party. But he can't win. Somebody like me would have a chance to win. And I will make that determination over a period of time, probably by February, March, something to like that. And if I think I can win, I might very well run. So what are you going to do this far as you have to get the economic currency? A lot. If I decide to run, a lot. As you know, I haven't decided to run. If I decide to run, a lot. Well, I don't need campaign. I mean, it's sort of a nice type of campaign where I truly don't need campaign contributions. So that's a big advantage. Would we accept? I guess I always accept, honest to money. But it's not something we've really given very much thought to. If I decide to run, I would spend many, many millions of dollars to make sure that we do a real job of it. And again, it's like I said, the alternatives, that all look so great to me. How important is Florida and the reform party at the top? It's very important. Florida is a great state. It's a big state. I'm here a lot. One of the reasons I'm here now, I spend lots of time in Palm Beach, a different section of Florida. It's an hour away, less than an hour away. And I'm in Florida a lot. I know a lot about the state. I know a lot about this area where I spend also a lot of time. Florida is an important state. And the reform party in Florida is very organized and very important. Yes? Well, no, I don't think so. I don't think it was a mistake. It was, it's a comedy show. It's meant to its comedy. And you know, it's sort of interesting. You can say something on a show and everybody laughs and we're all laughing, having a good time. But when you read it in print, it comes out a lot differently than the way it's actually said. That show was fun for everybody. People that heard the show loved it. They all thought it was really just a good time. And if you understand how it's turned, you'll understand what I'm talking about. I mean, he's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's fine. His show is a very significant show. It's probably got the highest ratings in the history of radio. And we had a lot of fun on the show. But unfortunately, you take that out of context and you write your little stories and you put it in the written word as opposed to listening to what was said. And it comes out quite a bit differently. So no, I don't regret it. I think we just, it's a comedy show. Excuse me. Would I do it again? I do it again. I mean, it was everybody that listened to it loved it. Now, if you take it out of context, it's a little different story. But anybody that listened to it absolutely had a good time. I liked it. Yes? Well, I would spend whatever is necessary to get the ballot access. I'd also spend whatever is necessary to win the election. You know, Russ is out of the party pretty soon in terms of leadership. And as you know. And he's been, I guess, a good leader. I don't know him. I don't, I haven't met him. But as I told anybody that would listen in the reform party, I would spend the money necessary to get the nomination if I decide to go that way, likewise, and perhaps even more importantly, I'd spend the money necessary to win the election. Because ultimately, the nomination, other than for the next one down the road, the nomination in terms of doing well doesn't mean very much to me. The thing that would mean something to me is winning. Are you fighting for the right to do this? You are fighting for the right to do this? Well, I've already had three number one best sellers. I've written three books. I've, they've all been number one, the art of the deal, surviving at the top, the art of the comeback. They've all done tremendous business. The book publishers love me. I don't need to do this to sell a book. I am coming out with a book in December. And I think that book will do very well on its own without this. As far as the rest of business is concerned, hey, I do well in business. I've sort of always done well. In the early 90s, we had a real estate crisis. Friends of mine went bankrupt. They went out of business. They were gone, never to be heard from again. Some very good people. I didn't. I did better. I mean, I'm doing better now than I've ever done in business. Far better than I ever did in the 80s. So, you know, other people didn't get through that crisis. And that was truly a crisis. So, I don't need this to sell condos. I don't need this for whatever I might be doing. Because my business has been so good. But I will tell you, I think I could make a contribution if I decide to go. And if I decide to go, I really think I'll go on the basis of trying to win and maybe win it indeed. Yes, we have a good time. And I'm supporting him in everything what he decided to do. I'm going to have to be a friend of mine. Let's see where we're going. She could do the best job. Okay. Thank you. Well, I think actually the tax issue solves a lot of other issues. It solves social security. It solves cutting taxes because you taxes would be much lower. And it solves a lot of other things. Even for instance, for the rich, the inheritance tax. And I've had so many people say, oh, that inheritance tax, such a terrible tax. And it is a terrible tax. And under my plan, it goes away. It's not a huge tax, but it's a huge tax for those people that destroy their businesses, destroy their farms, lose ownership of property that they've had in a family for generations. It's a very important thing for them. And that's not all very rich people. So that goes away. So, you know, it really, that tax happens to solve lots of different problems. And almost answers a lot of your question because you're covering social security, you're covering all sorts of things. And also very substantial tax cuts, including the inheritance. I am somebody that believes strongly in the environment. I think that sometimes some people get carried away. And I think sometimes people don't get carried away enough. I've been a lot of environmental, as you know. And then I get the king of zoning. I get lots of zone changes. To get zone changes, you have to do huge environmental impacts studies. Lots of other things. I understand the environment. I understand what goes on. I also understand the people that make money off of saying the environment. Consultants, engineers, all sorts of folks that are always lobbying. Not because they believe it, but because they can make big or fees. I understand that. But overall, I think I'm very, very strong in the environment and protecting the environment. And I think my record is really proven that. Yes, yes. The President has to run public funds. I think the American community can all trust other things. Yeah, that's the point. How would you put it in a second? Well, I think the Cuban American community, hopefully, I get great support from the community. You'd have to ask, OK, you really would have to speak to that yourself, I think. But I would say I get very good support from the Cuban American community. I think nobody's really been this upfront. I know you've had a lot of politicians coming here, even recently looking for that support. I'm not sure that anybody said anything. And certainly they haven't said what I've said. So Jorge and the whole group would really have to respond to that question. But I think I'd have the support of the Cuban. Well, I've watched the other candidates and I've watched the interviews. And I've watched the misstatements that they've made. And I've watched the incompetence. And I've watched a lot of things that they've been saying and doing. And if because somebody gets annoyed by a family, because the family's in politics, or somebody else's in politics, and the son wasn't particularly great at anything he's done over his life, and all of a sudden people get annoyed at it, I don't think that that makes them a better candidate than I would be. I've done very well at everything I've ever done. It was an example that I gave today. I have something in Palm Beach called Mar-a-Lago. It's probably the greatest estate anywhere in the United States. It was built by Mar-a-Marie Mar-a-Were the Post and E.F. Hutton. At a tremendous cost in the 20s and the early 20s. It took nine years to build. And I bought that and I turned it into a club. And everyone said number one, you'd never get the approvals. I got the approvals. After I got the approvals, they all said it'll never be successful. You'll never be able to make it successful. And now it's the most successful club there is. There was an article yesterday in the Palm Beach Daily News, or the shiny sheet talking about the fact that Mar-a-Lago has become the club, the hot club, in wake of a lot of competition. Now, this is one thing. This is a small thing. But in its own way, that was as difficult or more difficult than other things we're talking about. So, and I've done that many times with many different things at a much higher level. And that's the average. Well, it's not average. What it really is is success. Some people have a way of getting things done. Some people have a way of success, whether it's buildings or business or politics or whatever it might be. I've been successful. I went to a great school. I did well in the great school. I've been successful with what I've done. And I think that's probably more than can be said for other candidates. In many cases. Go ahead. I think nobody really from the outside, and maybe even from the inside, understands politicians the way I do. I've been maxed out every year. I'm not saying I'm proud of it or unproud of it. The fact is, I've been a major supporter of certain politicians over the years. I've done well with politicians over the years. You look at Washington right now. It's total gridlock. Nothing gets done. Nothing gets approved. The Democrats are fighting the Republicans. I've always been able to bring people together and you understand that. I've always been able to, and I've always gotten along well with politicians. And I think you wouldn't have the gridlock in Washington. I think I actually have in many respects more experience dealing with politicians than many politicians did. Well, it's not to say I don't want to put it in. It's not to say I don't want to part of it. I will go there at some time, perhaps, assuming I decide not to run for the presidency, of course. I will go there at some point because I think it has tremendous potential. But I'll go there when it's free. My basic policy is that you have to keep the pressure on Fidel Castro. You have to keep it on big lead. It's starting to wilt under our secretariat of state and our leaders in Washington. And I'm sure as Jorge will tell you, it's starting to wilt and starting to wilt very seriously. If that's the case, then all of the effort, and all of the years of struggle and death, and all of the other things that have taken place will have been wasted because that regime, whether it's led by Castro or somebody else, communism, everything, that whole regime will be rich, strong, and better than ever before. And this is not the time at the end, because you're at the end of the cycle, but this is not the time to get weak. And I think that at this moment, based on what I'm seeing in Washington, there's a lot of weakness, and that's going to keep the regime going. And I don't think that's appropriate, and it's certainly not good for this country. Beyond even the Cuban Americans, it's not good for this country. Yes, ma'am? Well, in terms of healthcare, I'm very, very strongly in favor of very powerful healthcare, a very substantial healthcare, because if we can't take care of our agent and if we can't take care of our sick, what is the purpose of all of it? We have two main things, protection, military protection, and healthcare, and those are two very vital areas. In terms of abortion, in favor of choice, I hate the concept of abortion, in favor of choice, nevertheless, I really don't see the alternatives. I don't think that there's really inadequate and satisfactory alternatives. So while I dislike it, I have to say that I'm in favor of choice. My business, I have great people, great managers, terrific folks, and I'd probably put it in trust, and I'm sure they would do a very good job of it. I'd let normal right behind you getting off a little bit more than she's already involved. Yes? Well, you have two odds, the odds of my running and the odds of my winning. Basically, the odds of running are there. We're very strongly considering it the odds of winning. I think they're good if I decide to run. We're going to have one more question in English, and then we're going to build a Spanish. Some of my real opponents in the world are... Mark, we're hearing now from the RNC, correct? We are now, Anderson. There's been a lot of talk about what is going to happen next with John Kasich, saying he's going to stay in, but the Republican National Committee just now has said that they expect Donald Trump to be the Republican nominee. They tweeted it right there. If you look at that, at Real Donald Trump will be the presumptive A.G.O.P. nominee. We will all need to unite and focus on defeating Hillary Clinton. Now, this comes, Anderson, as the Republican National Committee is trying to get together their convention out in Cleveland. They were preparing for a contested convention. Now, all that will shift to Donald Trump now being the presumptive nominee, him becoming the Republican nominee in July in Cleveland. Anderson.
