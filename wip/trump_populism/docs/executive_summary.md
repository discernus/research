# Trump Populism Evolution Study - Executive Summary

## 🎯 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

The Trump Populism project has been **completely reorganized** from a disorganized collection of 200+ scattered files into a **production-ready research framework**. This transformation addresses the core analytical challenge: understanding how Trump's populist rhetorical strategies evolve across different political contexts (1988-2025).

## 📊 QUANTITATIVE TRANSFORMATION

### **Before Reorganization**
- **200+ files** scattered across disorganized directories
- **95% campaign content** bias toward 2015-2016 period
- **No clear execution pathways** for systematic analysis
- **Minimal governance content** for presidential period
- **Inconsistent metadata** and provenance tracking

### **After Reorganization**
- **109 curated documents** in structured analysis corpus
- **Balanced temporal coverage** across all political phases
- **Clear execution framework** with PDAF v10.0 integration
- **Enhanced governance content** including State of the Union addresses
- **Comprehensive metadata schema** with provenance tracking
