## üéØ **Next Priority: Phase 2 - Campaign Corpus Winnowing**

### **Current Challenge**
- **93% of documents** are from campaign phase (2015-2016)
- **Severe imbalance** makes analysis heavily skewed toward campaign rhetoric
- **Missing coverage** of governance, post-presidency, and current periods

### **Strategic Goal**
Transform from **125 campaign speeches** to **40-50 strategically selected speeches** while maintaining comprehensive coverage of themes and audiences.

### **Selection Criteria**
1. **Audience Diversity**: Rallies, town halls, policy speeches, media appearances
2. **Geographic Distribution**: Swing states, different regions, urban vs. rural
3. **Temporal Distribution**: Early campaign, primary season, general election, final stretch
4. **Thematic Diversity**: Economic policy, foreign policy, social issues, anti-establishment rhetoric

### **Implementation Strategy**
- **Keep All Original Files**: Move to `campaign_2015_2016/archive/` subdirectory
- **Create Curated Subset**: Select 40-50 speeches for primary analysis
- **Metadata Analysis**: Use filename patterns to identify unique themes/audiences
- **Documentation Update**: Update corpus manifest and metadata
