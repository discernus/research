John Kasich’s Speech after Winning the Ohio Primary on March 15, 2016

15 March 16	

	You better — you better believe — you better believe it’s about America. It’s about pulling us together, not pulling us apart. It is about USA. Exactly! Well, first of all, I want to…Listen, listen everybody. Let me —hey! Well, when you went to college in the 1970s, you appreciate a good, peaceful protest every once in a while. Huh? Yeah, me too. First of all, you know when you’re in the arena and you are struggling and you leave your family to go out on the campaign trail and deliver a message to America because you believe that you — you believe that you are the best qualified person to be president of the United States. And you put it all on the line, and your family puts it all on the line. And I want this crowd here tonight to give a great — a great response to a very, very great, talented and fine United States Senator Marco Rubio for the effort that he has done. Tonight, tonight, we arrived in Cleveland and we went to a restaurant. We thought we could kind of sneak in and grab a quick meal. And when we walked through the restaurant, people started to cheer. My reaction is please don’t do that because you’re going to make me cry. But to have people believe in you and to believe that you can bring people together and strengthen our country, I have to thank the people of the great state of Ohio. I love you. Is it all right to tell I love you? 

	You know, when I became governor of Ohio, I went to New York and I met with some of the rating agencies. Things were bad. We had lost 350,000 jobs. We were $8 billion in the hole. And our credit was hanging in the balance. And they told me, “We were about to cut up your credit card and give you a new one where you can’t buy as much.” I said, “You don’t understand Ohio. You don’t understand Ohioans.” So I can’t wait to go back again. We’re now up 400,000 plus jobs. We’re running a $2 billion surplus. Our pensions are secure. We’ve cut taxes by more than any governor in this country, and we are leaving no one behind — not the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor. And I don’t know whether you can actually serve a meal of words but I would like to go back to those credit rating agencies where they can eat their words about doubting Ohio. Huh? And you know, ladies and gentlemen, you know, look, my whole life has been about trying to create a climate of opportunity for people. You know, as my father carried that mail on his back and his father was a coal miner, and you know, I was just told by my cousin I didn’t realize this that my mother — one of four — was the only one to graduate from high school. The other three barely made it out of the eighth grade because they were poor. And you know, as I’ve traveled the country and I look into your eyes, you want to believe, you want to believe again that we can have job security. You want to believe again that wages can rise. You want to believe that your children are going to have ultimately a better America than what we got from our mothers and fathers. That’s the great American legacy that our kids will be better than we are.

	And I want people in Ohio to know, as I think you do, I want people around the country to know that I understand these tough issues. I grew up in these situations, in that little blue collar town and McKees Rocks. And in my mind’s eye is the need to forget the politics, forget the pollsters, forget all of the focus groups because, you see, I represent you and it is my job to look at these situations and these problems and to listen to you and then it’s my job to go and fix them. And if that means at times I have to take some heat, well, then that’s just the price of leadership in America. Okay? Now, I want you to know the campaign goes on and I also want you to know that it’s been my intention to make you proud. It’s been my intention to have young people all across this country watch somebody enter into politics even though I labored in obscurity for so long people counting me out, people in Ohio saying, “Why don’t they ever call on him?” Okay? We get all that. But we put one foot in front of the other, and I want to remind you again tonight that I will not take the low road to the highest office in the land. You know, the challenges that we have — we can go to Washington and the first 100 days fix these problems with a shock and awe agenda that can pass. I think we can rally the people in Washington, because I’m going to remind them that before we’re Republicans and Democrats, we’re Americans and we have an obligation to our children. But I really, really, really believe this and want you to know this. And maybe in many respects, this is why I’ve been given a chance to stand here tonight and I’ve earned a victory. You know, the Lord’s made everybody here special. I’ve been telling people this all across this country. Nobody, sir, has ever been made like you before and no one will ever be like you again. And young lady, you’re here at a moment in time and your job is to find that purpose that you have. Your job is to live life a little bit bigger than yourself. Your job is to be a center of healing and justice and hope in whatever way we can. If we’re a school teacher, we give up money to change lives. If we’re a nurse, we work 15 extra minutes when we’re dead on our feet because we want to assure a family that things are going to be okay.

	And if we are a neighbor, that means that widow who was married for 50 years who no one calls anymore, you want to change the world? You take her to dinner on Saturday night. She’ll wear that dress she hadn’t worn in six months. I trust you to do it. You see, what I learned as a boy, what I learned from my mother and father is that the spirit of America rests in us. It doesn’t rest in a big-time politician, the big wigs. Look, you hire us to go do the job, plain and simple, to create an environment of economic growth and opportunity. But that’s not where our spirit is. Our spirit is in us believing that through our efforts in whichever part of the world that we live that we can change the world, that we can carve out a better future, that we can realize that those special gifts that were given to each and every one of us in here are something that we can use to heal the world. And you know, we’re all part of a giant mosaic — a snapshot in time — all of us here. And it is our job as Americans, our job as people who want to be decent and live good lives is to dig down and understand that purpose and never underestimate our ability to change the world in which we live. Well, guess what? Tomorrow, I’m going to Philadelphia. And then I’m going — I don’t know — all over the country. Okay? And many of you have traveled around this country trying to help me. You know what? Look, this is all I’ve got. This is all I’ve got. And all I can say is thank you from the bottom of my heart but I want you to know something. We’re going to go — we are going to go all the way to Cleveland and secure the Republican nomination. And you know, I also want to thank — you know, my father was a Democrat all his life. He was. We had a lot of Democrats who said they didn’t like a socialist agenda or a left-wing agenda or a big government. I want to thank them for coming over this election and putting their confidence in me. Because I think we all know that conservative principles can work, that common sense can work, that shifting power and money and influence from that big place in Washington and moving it to where we live, it empowers us. That’s the direction for our country. That is the direction for our country. And finally and finally, I want you coming out on the road. I want you continuing to do what we’ve been doing all over this country. Iâ€™m getting ready to rent a covered wagon. We’re going to have a big sail and we’re going to have the wind blow us to the Rocky Mountains and over the mountains to California. And here’s what I want you to know —we’ve got one more trip around Ohio this coming fall where we will beat Hillary Clinton and I will become the president of the United States. Thank you all very much! God bless you!
