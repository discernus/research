I'll analyze the provided document (John Kasich's speech after winning the Ohio Primary on March 15, 2016) using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework v10.0.2 with three independent analytical approaches, then aggregate the results.

## STEP 1: Three Independent Analytical Approaches

**APPROACH 1 - Evidence-First Analysis:**
Focusing on direct textual evidence and explicit statements:

- **Manichean People-Elite Framing**: 0.2 (low) - Some implicit critique of "big-time politicians" and "big wigs" but no strong moral dichotomy
- **Crisis-Restoration Narrative**: 0.3 (low) - References past economic problems in Ohio but frames as overcome, not ongoing crisis
- **Popular Sovereignty Claims**: 0.1 (minimal) - Strong representative democracy framing ("you hire us to go do the job")
- **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**: 0.0 (absent) - Explicitly inclusive, calls for unity across party lines
- **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**: 0.1 (minimal) - No conspiracy claims, institutional cooperation emphasis
- **Authenticity vs Political Class**: 0.4 (moderate) - Some working-class background emphasis and anti-establishment positioning
- **Homogeneous People Construction**: 0.5 (moderate) - Unity appeals but acknowledges differences
- **Nationalist Exclusion**: 0.1 (minimal) - Inclusive patriotism without exclusionary boundary-drawing
- **Economic Populist Appeals**: 0.3 (low) - Economic messaging but technocratic rather than populist framing

**APPROACH 2 - Context-Weighted Analysis:**
Emphasizing rhetorical positioning and thematic centrality:

- **Manichean People-Elite Framing**: 0.3 (low) - Structural positioning against Washington but without moral corruption claims
- **Crisis-Restoration Narrative**: 0.2 (low) - Past crisis overcome through competent governance narrative
- **Popular Sovereignty Claims**: 0.2 (low) - Representative framework maintained throughout
- **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**: 0.0 (absent) - Explicit respect for opposition, bipartisan appeals
- **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**: 0.0 (absent) - Institutional cooperation emphasis
- **Authenticity vs Political Class**: 0.6 (moderate) - Personal background and outsider positioning emphasized
- **Homogeneous People Construction**: 0.4 (moderate) - Unity construction but with acknowledgment of diversity
- **Nationalist Exclusion**: 0.0 (absent) - Inclusive vision of America
- **Economic Populist Appeals**: 0.2 (low) - Performance-based economic appeals rather than populist framing

**APPROACH 3 - Pattern-Based Analysis:**
Looking for repetition patterns and strategic emphasis:

- **Manichean People-Elite Framing**: 0.2 (low) - Limited pattern of elite-people contrast
- **Crisis-Restoration Narrative**: 0.4 (moderate) - Repeated references to Ohio's turnaround story
- **Popular Sovereignty Claims**: 0.1 (minimal) - Consistent representative democracy framing
- **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**: 0.0 (absent) - Consistent inclusivity patterns
- **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**: 0.0 (absent) - No conspiracy patterns
- **Authenticity vs Political Class**: 0.5 (moderate) - Repeated working-class identity markers
- **Homogeneous People Construction**: 0.6 (moderate) - Strong unity rhetoric patterns
- **Nationalist Exclusion**: 0.0 (absent) - No exclusionary patterns
- **Economic Populist Appeals**: 0.4 (moderate) - Economic success narrative patterns

## STEP 2: Calculate Median Scores

Taking the median across all three approaches:
- Manichean People-Elite Framing: 0.2
- Crisis-Restoration Narrative: 0.3
- Popular Sovereignty Claims: 0.1
- Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: 0.0
- Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption: 0.0
- Authenticity vs Political Class: 0.5
- Homogeneous People Construction: 0.5
- Nationalist Exclusion: 0.0
- Economic Populist Appeals: 0.3

## STEP 3: Select Best Evidence
