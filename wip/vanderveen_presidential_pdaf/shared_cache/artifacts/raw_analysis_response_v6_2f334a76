I'll analyze this Donald Trump Super Tuesday speech using three independent analytical approaches, then aggregate the results.

**APPROACH 1 - Evidence-First Analysis**: Focus on direct textual evidence and explicit statements

**APPROACH 2 - Context-Weighted Analysis**: Emphasize rhetorical context, structural positioning, and thematic centrality

**APPROACH 3 - Pattern-Based Analysis**: Look for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis

After completing all three approaches, I'll calculate median scores and select the best evidence.
