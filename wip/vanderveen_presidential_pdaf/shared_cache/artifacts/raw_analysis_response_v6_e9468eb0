The user wants me to analyze a political speech using a provided framework.
I need to perform three independent analyses, then aggregate the results by calculating the median scores and selecting the best evidence.

**Framework Interpretation (from base64 decoded framework):**
The framework is "Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2".
It has nine core dimensions, organized into three categories:
1.  **Primary Populist Core Anchors:**
    *   `manichaean_people_elite_framing`: Moral dichotomy between pure people and corrupt elites.
    *   `crisis_restoration_narrative`: Decline-crisis-redemption temporal structuring.
    *   `popular_sovereignty_claims`: Direct people's will as ultimate political authority, bypassing representative institutions.
    *   `anti_pluralist_exclusion`: Rejection of legitimate opposition and institutional constraints on popular will.
2.  **Populist Mechanism Anchors:**
    *   `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption`: Elite coordination against people's interests through hidden networks or institutional capture.
    *   `authenticity_vs_political_class`: Genuine representation versus professional politician artifice.
    *   `homogeneous_people_construction`: Unified people identity transcending internal divisions.
3.  **Boundary Distinction Anchors:**
    *   `nationalist_exclusion`: Cultural/ethnic homogeneity and external threat emphasis defining populist community boundaries.
    *   `economic_populist_appeals`: Populist economic discourse regardless of ideological direction (redistributive left to protectionist right).

**Scoring Scale:** 0.0-1.0 for intensity, salience, and confidence.
*   **Intensity (raw_score):** How strongly is the dimension expressed?
    *   High (0.7-1.0)
    *   Medium (0.4-0.6)
    *   Low (0.1-0.3)
    *   Absent (0.0)
*   **Salience:** Rhetorical prominence, not just intensity. Frequency, structural positioning, thematic centrality, rhetorical devices.
    *   High: Frequent repetition, thesis statements, central theme, metaphorical language.
    *   Medium: Some repetition, discussed, not central.
    *   Low: Passing mention.
*   **Confidence:** How confident am I in my scoring decision?

**Analytical Approaches:**
1.  **Evidence-First Analysis:** Prioritize explicit statements, clear indicators.
2.  **Context-Weighted Analysis:** Emphasize rhetorical context, structural positioning, thematic centrality.
3.  **Pattern-Based Analysis:** Look for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, strategic emphasis.

**Document to analyze:** `clinton_2016_10_22.txt` (Clinton speech)

---
**Plan:**
For each dimension:
1.  **Approach 1 (Evidence-First):** Read through the document, identify explicit statements, direct claims, and clear keywords related to each dimension. Score intensity, salience, and confidence based on these direct textual cues.
2.  **Approach 2 (Context-Weighted):** Read through the document, paying attention to where concepts are introduced, how much space they take up, if they are part of the main argument, and their rhetorical function in the broader speech. Score intensity, salience, and confidence based on this contextual understanding.
3.  **Approach 3 (Pattern-Based):** Read through, looking for repeated phrases, rhetorical figures (metaphors, analogies, contrasts), and patterns of argument that emphasize certain themes. Score intensity, salience, and confidence based on these patterns.

After the three analyses, I will aggregate the results:
*   For each dimension, calculate the median `raw_score`, `salience`, and `confidence` from the three approaches.
*   For each dimension, choose the best `quote_text` and its `confidence` and `context_type`.

**Mental Sandbox/Pre-computation (based on initial scan of the document):**

The speech seems to be a typical campaign speech, focusing on policy, contrasting with opponent, and mobilizing voters.
*   **Opponent (Trump):** Critiqued heavily, accused of threatening democracy, not paying taxes, making products abroad.
*   **"The People":** Referred to as "you," "everybody," "middle class," "working families." Focus on their concerns.
*   **Elites:** Trump and "powerful interests," "lobbyists and lawyers," "the rich."
*   **Crisis:** Implied by Trump's actions, but framed more as challenges than an existential crisis. There's an urgent need for action.
*   **Restoration:** Implied by "making progress together," "better America."
*   **Popular Sovereignty:** "It's about you," voting.
*   **Anti-Pluralist:** Critical of Trump, but generally emphasizes coming together. Maybe a hint of exclusion against those who don't 'care about you'.
*   **Elite Conspiracy:** Hints at "lobbyists and lawyers," "powerful interests," but not fully framed as a conspiracy. More about special interests.
*   **Authenticity:** Clinton positions herself as someone who cares about "you" (the people), contrasting with Trump's self-interest.
*   **Homogeneous People:** Emphasis on "we," "Americans," "everybody," transcending internal divisions for common good.
*   **Nationalist Exclusion:** Focus on American jobs, "make it in America," critiques Trump for producing abroad. Strong focus on American identity and economic nationalism.
*   **Economic Populist Appeals:** Very strong. Focus on middle class, working families, good jobs, raising minimum wage, equal pay, lowering healthcare costs. Explicitly contrasts with "trickle-down" economics.

Let's break down each dimension and try to generate initial thoughts for each of the three approaches.

**Dimension: `manichaean_people_elite_framing`**
*   **Approach 1 (Evidence-First):** Direct contrasts "the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy" vs. "you," "middle-class families," "working families." "Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers, but his actions tell a different story." "He has bought cheap Chinese steel... instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania." "every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has." "it's time to say loudly and clearly, right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America."
    *   Score: High (0.8), Salience (0.7), Conf (0.9)
*   **Approach 2 (Context-Weighted):** The speech consistently frames economic and political issues as a struggle between the interests of "the people" (middle class, working families) and "the powerful," "the rich," or Trump himself as an elite figure. This binary opposition is central to her economic arguments.
    *   Score: High (0.8), Salience (0.8), Conf (0.9)
*   **Approach 3 (Pattern-Based):** Repetitive contrasting phrases: "us" vs. "him," "the people" vs. "the rich/powerful/Trump." The phrase "trickle down" economics (associated with elites) vs. "middle out and bottom up" (associated with people). "On the side of the rich... or on your side?" This repeated rhetorical strategy reinforces the moral dichotomy.
    *   Score: High (0.9), Salience (0.9), Conf (0.9)

**Dimension: `crisis_restoration_narrative`**
*   **Approach 1 (Evidence-First):** "serious issues," "real challenges," "what are you going to do for them?", "choice we face in this election is stark". "America's best days are ahead of us." "We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in Pennsylvania." "make progress together."
    *   Score: Medium (0.6), Salience (0.5), Conf (0.8)
*   **Approach 2 (Context-Weighted):** While acknowledging problems ("real challenges," "upset"), the speech doesn't paint a picture of existential crisis. It's more about "making progress" and overcoming current difficulties through specific plans and collective action ("work together"). The restoration is framed as a positive future based on current efforts, not a redemption from a profound fall.
    *   Score: Medium (0.5), Salience (0.5), Conf (0.8)
*   **Approach 3 (Pattern-Based):** Less dramatic crisis language, more "problem-solving" language. "We need to knock down some of the barriers," "deal with the legitimate concerns." The restoration is about "making it work again," "good jobs," "rising incomes," not a return to a mythical past. The pattern is one of steady, practical improvement rather than dramatic rescue.
    *   Score: Medium (0.5), Salience (0.4), Conf (0.7)

**Dimension: `popular_sovereignty_claims`**
*   **Approach 1 (Evidence-First):** "the choice we face in this election," "it's on the ballot," "it is literally going to be on that ballot." "this is about you." "people are coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents -- all to reject hate and division." "to elect Katie McGinty, your next senator." "The best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote." "You've got to get out and vote, you've got to get everybody you know to get out and vote."
    *   Score: High (0.8), Salience (0.8), Conf (0.9)
*   **Approach 2 (Context-Weighted):** The speech is heavily focused on the power of the vote and the direct influence of the people in shaping the future. The repeated emphasis on "it's on the ballot," "it's about you," and direct appeals to "turn out and vote" highlight popular will as the driving force, implicitly bypassing traditional institutions to secure desired outcomes.
    *   Score: High (0.9), Salience (0.9), Conf (0.9)
*   **Approach 3 (Pattern-Based):** Repetition of "vote," "ballot," "you." Direct appeals to the audience as the source of change ("you should be electing, people who care about you"). The phrase "it's on the ballot" implies direct popular decision-making over complex policy or institutional processes.
    *   Score: High (0.9), Salience (0.9), Conf (0.9)

**Dimension: `anti_pluralist_exclusion`**
*   **Approach 1 (Evidence-First):** "He [Trump] is threatening our democracy." "Pat Toomey ... doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump." "refused to say he would respect the results of this election." "When Donald Trump says he wants to jail his opponent, meaning me, I think to myself, you know, we don't do that in America." "He blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press." "When he says there should be a religious test... we actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary." Explicit criticism of Trump's opposition to democratic norms.
    *   Score: High (0.8), Salience (0.7), Conf (0.9)
*   **Approach 2 (Context-Weighted):** While critical of Trump, the rhetoric frames his actions as outside legitimate democratic behavior (jailing opponents, religious tests, attacking press). This isn't anti-pluralism by rejecting legitimate opposition; it's by presenting the opponent as illegitimate. Clinton also stresses "coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents" to "reject hate and division," which argues *against* exclusion, but her strong framing of Trump's behavior as anti-democratic fits this dimension by making *him* illegitimate.
    *   Score: Medium (0.6), Salience (0.6), Conf (0.8) - *Self-correction: The emphasis is on Trump delegitimizing, rather than Clinton delegitimizing others. But the framing still highlights an opponent whose actions are beyond the pale of legitimate opposition.* Re-evaluating: The *target* of the anti-pluralism is Trump, who is presented as a threat to democratic institutions. The dimension definition refers to "rejection of legitimate opposition and institutional constraints on popular will." Trump's actions are described as rejecting institutional constraints. Clinton's rhetoric here is framed as defending those institutions *against* Trump's anti-pluralism, but in doing so, she is effectively excluding *his* approach as illegitimate. So, it's present.
    *   Score: High (0.7), Salience (0.7), Conf (0.8)
*   **Approach 3 (Pattern-Based):** The repeated attacks on Trump's rhetoric regarding election results, jailing opponents, and attacking the press form a pattern of portraying his political behavior as fundamentally illegitimate within a democratic framework. This implies that such behavior *must* be excluded for democracy to function.
    *   Score: High (0.8), Salience (0.8), Conf (0.9)

**Dimension: `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption`**
*   **Approach 1 (Evidence-First):** "The members of congress, members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy, or on your side? And you know what? They are going to have to answer that question. Because if they stay beholden to the special interests, if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyists and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors -- I have been in the Senate. I have seen it." This speaks to institutional capture, "bidding of lobbyists."
    *   Score: Medium (0.6), Salience (0.5), Conf (0.8)
*   **Approach 2 (Context-Weighted):** While criticizing "special interests," "lobbyists and lawyers," the speech doesn't explicitly claim a hidden "conspiracy" or "secret coordination." It's more about undue influence and legislative capture rather than a shadowy cabal actively plotting against the people. It focuses on transparency and accountability.
    *   Score: Medium (0.5), Salience (0.4), Conf (0.7)
*   **Approach 3 (Pattern-Based):** The "side of the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy" vs. "your side" is a recurring theme that suggests a coordinated elite interest, even if the word "conspiracy" isn't used. The phrase "doing the bidding of the lobbyists and lawyers" implies a systematic, if not secretive, corruption of the legislative process by external elite interests.
    *   Score: Medium (0.6), Salience (0.6), Conf (0.8)

**Dimension: `authenticity_vs_political_class`**
*   **Approach 1 (Evidence-First):** Clinton emphasizes her connection to "the people" by talking about personal stories ("My son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin. What are you going to do about it?"), presenting herself as understanding their concerns. She says "I hope you will tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too." This contrasts with "professional politician artifice" but not explicitly. More implied.
    *   Score: Medium (0.5), Salience (0.4), Conf (0.7)
*   **Approach 2 (Context-Weighted):** Clinton positions herself as a listener and a champion of everyday people, contrasting implicitly with a political class perceived as out of touch. Her "stories from the road" serve to demonstrate her direct connection to ordinary people's struggles, suggesting a genuine understanding beyond typical political posturing. The contrast is primarily with Trump's perceived lack of empathy or self-serving nature rather than the political class as a whole.
    *   Score: Medium (0.6), Salience (0.5), Conf (0.8)
*   **Approach 3 (Pattern-Based):** The repeated rhetorical device of recounting individual struggles ("my son... addicted," "my brother has schizophrenia," "I am a diabetic") and then asking "What are you going to do about it?" establishes her as a relatable figure who hears the people, in contrast to distant politicians. This builds an image of authenticity.
    *   Score: Medium (0.6), Salience (0.6), Conf (0.8)

**Dimension: `homogeneous_people_construction`**
*   **Approach 1 (Evidence-First):** "people are coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents -- all to reject hate and division." "Most Americans really believe we can do better. Most Americans really believe women should be respected. Most Americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly." "When you focus on helping the middle class, you end up lifting everybody." "We are human beings."
    *   Score: High (0.7), Salience (0.7), Conf (0.9)
*   **Approach 2 (Context-Weighted):** The speech consistently refers to a collective "we" and "Americans," emphasizing shared values and goals that transcend partisan or demographic divides. The idea is that "we" are united in wanting good jobs, fair pay, and a functional democracy, implying a fundamental unity among the people against a common problem (Trump, economic challenges).
    *   Score: High (0.8), Salience (0.8), Conf (0.9)
*   **Approach 3 (Pattern-Based):** The repeated use of "we," "Americans," and phrases like "coming together" from different political affiliations ("democrats, republicans, independents") against "hate and division" builds a narrative of a unified "people" with shared aspirations and values. This contrasts sharply with internal divisions.
    *   Score: High (0.8), Salience (0.8), Conf (0.9)

**Dimension: `nationalist_exclusion`**
*   **Approach 1 (Evidence-First):** "Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers, but his actions tell a different story. Yes, he has bought cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects. He should be buying good American-made steel that supports good American jobs." "For all his talk about putting America first, he has made many of his products in 12 different countries." "We believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States." This focuses on economic nationalism and implicitly excludes foreign products/workers in favor of American ones, framing it as a betrayal by Trump.
    *   Score: High (0.8), Salience (0.7), Conf (0.9)
*   **Approach 2 (Context-Weighted):** This dimension is present through economic arguments rather than overt cultural/ethnic exclusion. The focus on "American-made steel" and products made in "12 different countries" (implicitly bad) emphasizes a national economic boundary and preference. While not overtly xenophobic, it defines the "in-group" by national economic loyalty.
    *   Score: Medium (0.6), Salience (0.6), Conf (0.8)
*   **Approach 3 (Pattern-Based):** The repeated contrast between "American-made" and "Chinese steel," "products in 12 different countries," and the "America first" rhetoric by Trump (which she critiques him for not living up to) forms a pattern of economic nationalism. She co-opts the language of national preference to critique Trump and position herself as the true defender of American jobs.
    *   Score: High (0.7), Salience (0.7), Conf (0.9)

**Dimension: `economic_populist_appeals`**
*   **Approach 1 (Evidence-First):** "grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down." "make sure that we produce enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person... can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you." "raise the national mini-mum wage." "guarantee equal pay for women." "Make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And we are going to help you pay down your college debt." This is strongly focused on economic well-being for the broad population, implicitly (or explicitly) at the expense of corporate/elite interests.
    *   Score: High (0.9), Salience (0.9), Conf (0.9)
*   **Approach 2 (Context-Weighted):** Economic policy is a central theme, consistently framed through the lens of benefit for the "middle class" and "working families" vs. the failures of "trickle-down" economics that benefit "millionaires, billionaires, corporations." This binary framing of economic interests aligns perfectly with populist economic appeals.
    *   Score: High (0.9), Salience (0.9), Conf (0.9)
*   **Approach 3 (Pattern-Based):** Repetition of "middle class," "working families," "good jobs," "rising incomes." Direct contrasting with "trickle-down" economics and tax cuts for the wealthy. The pattern emphasizes broad economic uplift as opposed to elite enrichment, a core populist economic message.
    *   Score: High (0.9), Salience (0.9), Conf (0.9)
