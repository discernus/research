I'll analyze the Trump speech using three independent analytical approaches, then aggregate the results.

**APPROACH 1: Evidence-First Analysis**
Focusing on direct textual evidence and explicit statements:

- Manichean People-Elite Framing: 0.9 (Strong dichotomy: "It will be a win for the voters – not the pundits, not the journalists, not the lobbyists, not the global special interests")
- Crisis-Restoration Narrative: 0.8 (Clear decline-restoration arc: "break free from the bitter failures of the past" → "New American Future")
- Popular Sovereignty Claims: 0.7 ("This is going to be YOUR victory" - direct popular authority)
- Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: 0.3 (Limited explicit opposition rejection)
- Elite Conspiracy: 0.6 ("pay-for-play" Clinton Foundation claims)
- Authenticity vs Political Class: 0.7 ("I am the change agent. Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo")
- Homogeneous People Construction: 0.8 ("one American people" with shared culture and values)
- Nationalist Exclusion: 0.5 (Cultural values emphasis but moderate exclusion)
- Economic Populist Appeals: 0.8 (Strong economic elite vs workers framing throughout)

**APPROACH 2: Context-Weighted Analysis**
Emphasizing rhetorical positioning and thematic centrality:

- Manichean People-Elite Framing: 0.8 (Central theme but mixed with policy specifics)
- Crisis-Restoration Narrative: 0.9 (Core organizing principle of entire speech)
- Popular Sovereignty Claims: 0.6 (Present but not central focus)
- Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: 0.4 (Some delegitimization but not prominent)
- Elite Conspiracy: 0.7 (Systematic corruption claims central to argument)
- Authenticity vs Political Class: 0.8 (Major positioning strategy throughout)
- Homogeneous People Construction: 0.7 (Important but secondary to other themes)
- Nationalist Exclusion: 0.6 (Moderate cultural boundary-drawing)
- Economic Populist Appeals: 0.9 (Dominant theme with extensive development)

**APPROACH 3: Pattern-Based Analysis**
Looking for repetition patterns and strategic emphasis:

- Manichean People-Elite Framing: 0.7 (Consistent pattern but varies in intensity)
- Crisis-Restoration Narrative: 0.8 (Repeated "Make America [X] Again" pattern)
- Popular Sovereignty Claims: 0.5 (Present but not heavily repeated)
- Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: 0.2 (Minimal exclusionary patterns)
- Elite Conspiracy: 0.5 (Some coordination claims but not systematic)
- Authenticity vs Political Class: 0.6 (Moderate outsider positioning)
- Homogeneous People Construction: 0.6 (Unity themes present but not dominant)
- Nationalist Exclusion: 0.4 (Limited cultural exclusion patterns)
- Economic Populist Appeals: 0.7 (Strong but mixed with policy details)

**MEDIAN CALCULATIONS:**
- Manichean People-Elite Framing: 0.8
- Crisis-Restoration Narrative: 0.8
- Popular Sovereignty Claims: 0.6
- Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: 0.3
- Elite Conspiracy: 0.6
- Authenticity vs Political Class: 0.7
- Homogeneous People Construction: 0.7
- Nationalist Exclusion: 0.5
- Economic Populist Appeals: 0.8
