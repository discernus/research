Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo\")\n- Homogeneous People Construction: 0.8 (\"one American people\" with shared culture and values)\n- Nationalist Exclusion: 0.5 (Cultural values emphasis but moderate exclusion)\n- Economic Populist Appeals: 0.8 (Strong economic elite vs workers framing throughout)\n\n**APPROACH 2: Context-Weighted Analysis**\nEmphasizing rhetorical positioning and thematic centrality:\n\n- Manichean People-Elite Framing: 0.8 (Central theme but mixed with policy specifics)\n- Crisis-Restoration Narrative: 0.9 (Core organizing principle of entire speech)\n- Popular Sovereignty Claims: 0.6 (Present but not central focus)\n- Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: 0.4 (Some delegitimization but not prominent)\n- Elite Conspiracy: 0.7 (Systematic corruption claims central to argument)\n- Authenticity vs Political Class: 0.8 (Major positioning strategy throughout)\n- Homogeneous People Construction: 0.7 (Important but secondary to other themes)\n- Nationalist Exclusion: 0.6 (Moderate cultural boundary-drawing)\n- Economic Populist Appeals: 0.9 (Dominant theme with extensive development)\n\n**APPROACH 3: Pattern-Based Analysis**\nLooking for repetition patterns and strategic emphasis:\n\n- Manichean People-Elite Framing: 0.7 (Consistent pattern but varies in intensity)\n- Crisis-Restoration Narrative: 0.8 (Repeated \"Make America [X] Again\" pattern)\n- Popular Sovereignty Claims: 0.5 (Present but not heavily repeated)\n- Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: 0.2 (Minimal exclusionary patterns)\n- Elite Conspiracy: 0.5 (Some coordination claims but not systematic)\n- Authenticity vs Political Class: 0.6 (Moderate outsider positioning)\n- Homogeneous People Construction: 0.6 (Unity themes present but not dominant)\n- Nationalist Exclusion: 0.4 (Limited cultural exclusion patterns)\n- Economic Populist Appeals: 0.7 (Strong but mixed with policy details)\n\n**MEDIAN CALCULATIONS:**\n- Manichean People-Elite Framing: 0.8\n- Crisis-Restoration Narrative: 0.8\n- Popular Sovereignty Claims: 0.6\n- Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: 0.3\n- Elite Conspiracy: 0.6\n- Authenticity vs Political Class: 0.7\n- Homogeneous People Construction: 0.7\n- Nationalist Exclusion: 0.5\n- Economic Populist Appeals: 0.8\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_ANALYSIS_JSON_v6>>>\n{\n  \"analysis_metadata\": {\n    \"framework_name\": \"populist_discourse_analysis_framework\",\n    \"framework_version\": \"10.0.2\",\n    \"analyst_confidence\": 0.92,\n    \"analysis_notes\": \"Applied three independent analytical approaches with median aggregation.
