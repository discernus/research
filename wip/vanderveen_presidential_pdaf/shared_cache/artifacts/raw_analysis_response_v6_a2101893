I'll analyze the Trump 2016 RNC speech using three independent analytical approaches, then aggregate the results.

**APPROACH 1 - Evidence-First Analysis:**

Emphasizing rhetorical context, structural positioning, and thematic centrality.

**APPROACH 3 - Pattern-Based Analysis:**
Looking for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis.

After conducting all three approaches and calculating median scores:
