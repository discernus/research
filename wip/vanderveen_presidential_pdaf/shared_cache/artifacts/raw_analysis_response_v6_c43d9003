I'll analyze the document using three independent analytical approaches as specified.

**APPROACH 1: Evidence-First Analysis**
Focusing on direct textual evidence and explicit statements:

- **Manichean People-Elite Framing**: 0.8 (Strong binary framing: "pure, virtuous people" vs. "corrupt, self-serving elites" - explicit in Hillary Clinton email critique, "criminals" vs. protection rhetoric)
- **Crisis-Restoration Narrative**: 0.7 (Clear decline language: "depleted military," "record-setting lows," with restoration promises to make military "stronger than ever before")
- **Popular Sovereignty Claims**: 0.4 (Some direct democracy appeals but limited institutional bypass rhetoric)
- **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**: 0.3 (Limited opposition rejection, mostly policy disagreement)
- **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**: 0.6 (Clear corruption claims about Hillary Clinton, system manipulation)
- **Authenticity vs Political Class**: 0.5 (Some outsider positioning but not central theme)
- **Homogeneous People Construction**: 0.6 (Veterans as unified virtuous group, "forgotten man and woman")
- **Nationalist Exclusion**: 0.5 (Immigration threat language, cultural boundary-drawing)
- **Economic Populist Appeals**: 0.4 (Some economic grievance framing)

**APPROACH 2: Context-Weighted Analysis**
Emphasizing rhetorical context and structural positioning:

- **Manichean People-Elite Framing**: 0.9 (Central structural theme throughout speech)
- **Crisis-Restoration Narrative**: 0.8 (Opens and closes with crisis-restoration framing)
- **Popular Sovereignty Claims**: 0.5 (Moderate emphasis on direct representation)
- **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**: 0.4 (Some exclusionary rhetoric toward opponents)
- **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**: 0.7 (Prominent corruption themes)
- **Authenticity vs Political Class**: 0.7 (Strong positioning as outsider throughout)
- **Homogeneous People Construction**: 0.8 (Veterans and "forgotten people" as central unified identity)
- **Nationalist Exclusion**: 0.6 (Immigration and external threat emphasis)
- **Economic Populist Appeals**: 0.3 (Limited economic populist framing)

**APPROACH 3: Pattern-Based Analysis**
Looking for repetition patterns and strategic emphasis:

- **Manichean People-Elite Framing**: 0.7 (Repeated corruption vs. virtue patterns)
- **Crisis-Restoration Narrative**: 0.6 (Consistent decline-restoration language pattern)
- **Popular Sovereignty Claims**: 0.3 (Limited repetition of direct democracy themes)
- **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**: 0.2 (Minimal exclusionary pattern repetition)
- **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**: 0.5 (Moderate repetition of conspiracy themes)
- **Authenticity vs Political Class**: 0.6 (Consistent outsider positioning pattern)
- **Homogeneous People Construction**: 0.7 (Strong unity construction patterns)
- **Nationalist Exclusion**: 0.4 (Some repeated boundary-drawing)
- **Economic Populist Appeals**: 0.5 (Moderate economic grievance patterns)
