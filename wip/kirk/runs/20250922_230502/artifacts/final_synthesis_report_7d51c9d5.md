### 1. Executive Summary

This report outlines a proposed computational analysis of the rhetorical evolution of Charlie Kirk, a prominent figure in American conservative populism, using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. The study is designed to apply the CFF to a corpus of 14 speeches spanning from 2015 to 2024, a period covering his entire public career from the founding of Turning Point USA to his role as a major political commentator. The primary objective is to generate empirical, replicable data on the shifting rhetorical patterns in his discourse, providing a quantitative basis for understanding his communication strategies.

The CFF is a sophisticated measurement tool designed to move beyond simple valence analysis by independently scoring ten dimensions across five opposing conceptual pairs (e.g., Hope vs. Fear, Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity). Its core innovation lies in its dual-track measurement of both the *intensity* and rhetorical *salience* of each dimension, allowing for a nuanced assessment of strategic communication. This methodology enables the calculation of advanced metrics such as the `Strategic Contradiction Index` and a suite of `Cohesion Indices`, which are designed to quantify rhetorical coherence and the overall pro-social or fragmentative thrust of a text.

Pending the generation of statistical data, this analysis is structured to be exploratory, guided by the analytical groupings defined in the corpus (career phase, event type, audience). The central narrative to be investigated is the trajectory of Kirk's rhetoric as measured by the CFF's composite indices. The analysis would systematically track the `Full Cohesion Index` over time to test for trends toward more cohesive or fragmentative discourse. For instance, early in his career, Kirk's rhetoric might focus on specific institutional threats, as when he stated: "left-wing academics using their institutional titles and their power to try to block conservative organizations" (Source: Document 0). However, later discourse appears to escalate to more existential and exclusionary claims, such as: "But if you come from Somalia and you refuse to learn our language, adopt to our customs and assimilate, I'm sorry, America is closed to the third world until further notice" (Source: Document 13). Furthermore, it would examine how dimensional scores (e.g., `Tribal Dominance`, `Enmity`) and strategic patterns (e.g., `Emotional Tension`) vary across different contexts, such as speeches to student activists versus national convention addresses. The results of such an analysis would offer data-driven insights into the construction and evolution of a significant populist communication style.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights (Prospective)

This analysis is designed to generate the following key insights, which would be validated by statistical data:

*   **Rhetorical Evolution Over Time:** The analysis would quantify the trajectory of Kirk's rhetoric across his career. A primary focus would be on tracking the `Full Cohesion Index` and its component dimensions (e.g., `Tribal Dominance`, `Fragmentative Goals`) across the 'founding_era', 'early_career', 'mid_career', and 'late_career' phases to identify and measure any systematic shifts. For example, early discourse might highlight specific threats to rights, as when Kirk stated: "Free speech is being silenced, unlike any other time in human history" (Source: Document 1). In contrast, later rhetoric appears to escalate to broader, more existential threats and exclusionary tribalism, as exemplified by the statement: "Our country is literally dying, and I don't mean that in the abstract way that hysterical politicians sometimes mean it. I mean it in a really basic way. More of us are dying than are being born" (Source: Document 13).
*   **Audience-Specific Rhetorical Adaptation:** By comparing CFF scores across audience groupings (e.g., 'college_students', 'conservative_activists', 'republican_delegates'), the study would aim to reveal how Kirk's messaging is tailored. For instance, it would test whether `Amity` and `Hope` scores are higher when addressing internal supporters versus the `general_public` in a debate setting.
*   **Identification of Core Rhetorical Strategies:** Correlation analysis across the ten CFF dimensions would be used to uncover the central pillars of Kirk's communication style. A strong, persistent positive correlation between `Fear` and `Enmity`, for example, would suggest a core strategy of mobilizing audiences through threat perception and adversarial positioning. This is evident in statements that combine a sense of impending doom with a clear identification of an adversary, such as: "What is going on right now is a fight for freedom versus slavery, capitalism versus socialism" (Source: Document 1). Conversely, a strong positive correlation between `Hope` and `Cohesive Goals` would indicate a strategy of uniting audiences around a shared positive vision, as when Kirk proclaimed: "I believe if we do that and restore integrity in our elections, we're not just going to win a little. We're going to win big and we're going to win for the next couple decades" (Source: Document 7).
*   **Measurement of Strategic Contradiction:** The analysis would leverage the `Strategic Contradiction Index` to assess the rhetorical coherence of Kirk's speeches. It would investigate whether contradiction levels vary by `event_type`, hypothesizing that a `debate` might exhibit higher tension (e.g., high `Enmity` toward opponent, high `Amity` toward audience) than a `keynote_address`.
*   **Dominant Emotional and Relational Climates:** The study would provide mean scores for dimensions like `Fear`, `Hope`, `Enmity`, and `Amity` across the corpus. This would establish a quantitative baseline of the prevailing emotional and relational tones in Kirk's discourse, as measured by the CFF. For example, a high prevalence of `Fear` is often expressed through warnings about societal collapse, as Kirk stated: "I come with a warning and some insight. What I see on college campuses every single day is no different than what's happening in the Democrat primary right now, which is we have volunteered and sent our next generation to installations of indoctrination to teach the next generation to hate our country" (Source: Document 6). Similarly, `Enmity` is frequently directed at specific political figures or groups, as seen in: "Alexandria Kasiukortez and Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Presley and Ilan Omar, they are a harbinger for things to come. They have bitter resentment for the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world" (Source: Document 6).
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit Assessment:** The analysis would evaluate the appropriateness of the CFF for this specific corpus. The `framework-corpus fit score` would indicate how well the framework's dimensions capture the variance in the texts, providing a methodological insight into the CFF's utility for analyzing modern populist rhetoric.

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This study is situated at the intersection of computational social science, political communication, and discourse analysis. The analytical instrument, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF), is grounded in the deliberative democracy tradition (Gutmann & Thompson, 1996; Habermas, 1996), which posits that the quality of public discourse is fundamental to democratic legitimacy. The CFF operationalizes concepts from this tradition by measuring rhetorical indicators associated with either social cohesion (e.g., `Individual Dignity`, `Cohesive Goals`) or social fragmentation (e.g., `Tribal Dominance`, `Fragmentative Goals`).

The framework's dimensional structure draws on established theories. The **Identity Axis** (`Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`) is informed by Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999), which explain the dynamics of in-group favoritism and group-based hierarchy. The **Emotional Climate** axis (`Fear` vs. `Hope`) builds on research into emotional appeals in political advertising (Brader, 2006) and Affective Intelligence Theory (Marcus et al., 2000). The **Relational Climate** axis (`Enmity` vs. `Amity`) connects to scholarship on political polarization (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008).

However, the CFF specification explicitly notes that its empirical measurements can be interpreted through alternative theoretical lenses, such as **Agonistic Pluralism** (Mouffe, 2000). From an agonistic perspective, high scores in `Enmity` or `Fear` might not be interpreted as a democratic deficit but as a necessary and passionate component of political contestation that defines a "we/they" distinction central to politics. This study will primarily utilize the CFF's native deliberative framework for interpretation but will acknowledge where an agonistic reading might yield different conclusions, particularly in the Discussion section.

The application of this framework to the rhetoric of Charlie Kirk is significant. Kirk is a key figure in the modern American conservative movement, and his organization, Turning Point USA, has been highly influential in youth politics. Analyzing his discourse provides a case study in contemporary populist communication. This research, therefore, aims to contribute empirical data to ongoing scholarly conversations about the nature of populist rhetoric and its relationship to democratic norms.

### 4. Methodology

#### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4, a computational content analysis methodology for quantifying rhetorical patterns. The CFF's architecture is built on five bipolar axes, comprising ten independently scored dimensions: Identity (`Tribal Dominance`, `Individual Dignity`), Emotional Climate (`Fear`, `Hope`), Success Orientation (`Envy`, `Mudita`), Relational Climate (`Enmity`, `Amity`), and Goal Orientation (`Fragmentative Goals`, `Cohesive Goals`).

A novel feature of the CFF is its distinction between `raw_score` (intensity of a theme, 0.0-1.0) and `salience` (rhetorical prominence, 0.0-1.0). This dual-track system allows for the analysis of complex communication where opposing appeals may coexist. For example, a speech could score moderately on both `Fear` and `Hope`, with the salience scores revealing which theme was more central to the message.

This analysis utilizes the framework's derived metrics:
*   **Tension Indices:** To measure rhetorical contradiction within each axis.
*   **Strategic Contradiction Index:** To assess overall message incoherence.
*   **Cohesion Indices (`Descriptive`, `Motivational`, `Full`):** To provide a composite, salience-weighted measure of the discourse's orientation toward fragmentation (-1.0) or cohesion (+1.0).

The analytical approach is exploratory, leveraging the pre-defined `analytical_groupings` in the corpus manifest to compare CFF metrics across different contexts.

#### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The corpus consists of 14 full-length speeches by Charlie Kirk, delivered between 2015 and 2024. The total word count is 45,647 words. The documents represent a variety of contexts, including media interviews, conference keynotes (CPAC), national political conventions (RNC), student summits, and a formal debate.

For the purpose of statistical comparison, documents are categorized into analytical groups based on metadata:
*   **Career Phase:** `founding_era` (N=2), `early_career` (N=5), `mid_career` (N=4), `late_career` (N=3).
*   **Event Type:** `conference_speeches` (N=5), `convention_speeches` (N=2), `keynote_addresses` (N=2), `campus_speeches` (N=3), `media_appearances` (N=1), `debates` (N=1).
*   **Audience:** `conservative_activists` (N=5), `college_students` (N=3), `republican_delegates` (N=2), `tpusa_supporters` (N=2), `general_public` (N=2).

#### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

Upon generation of the data, the analysis would proceed as follows:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of means (M), standard deviations (SD), and confidence intervals (CI) for all 10 primary dimensions and all derived metrics, both for the entire corpus and for each analytical subgroup.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** Independent samples t-tests or ANOVA would be used to compare mean scores between analytical groups (e.g., `early_career` vs. `late_career`). Given the small sample sizes within some subgroups, non-parametric alternatives (e.g., Mann-Whitney U test) would be considered. All findings would be interpreted with caution appropriate to the statistical power.
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** Pearson correlation coefficients (r) would be calculated for all pairs of CFF dimensions and derived metrics to identify structural relationships and recurring rhetorical strategies within the corpus.
4.  **Trend Analysis:** Linear regression would be used to model the change in key metrics (e.g., `Full Cohesion Index`) over time, using the speech year as the independent variable.

**Limitations:** The primary limitation is the small sample size (N=14), which restricts the statistical power of inferential tests. Many subgroup comparisons (e.g., `debates`, N=1) will be purely descriptive. Therefore, findings should be considered preliminary and suggestive, forming a basis for future large-N studies. This report is further constrained by the absence of statistical data, making it a methodological prospectus.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

*(Note: The following sections are presented pro-forma. All tables are empty and await population from statistical analysis. The interpretations describe the analytical process that would be undertaken.)*

#### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

The experiment configuration did not specify any formal hypotheses. Therefore, this research is conducted as an exploratory analysis aimed at identifying patterns and generating hypotheses for future testing. The guiding research questions are implicit in the corpus's `analytical_groupings` and revolve around the evolution and contextual adaptation of Charlie Kirk's rhetoric as measured by the CFF.

#### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics would be calculated for the entire corpus to establish a baseline for Charlie Kirk's rhetoric as measured by the CFF. The tables below would be populated with the mean (M), standard deviation (SD), and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each metric across the 14 documents. Due to the small sample size (N=14), these findings are exploratory and suggestive rather than conclusive.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Primary Dimensions (N=14)**

**Interpretation of Descriptive Statistics:**
The analysis of these tables would focus on identifying the most and least prominent dimensions in the corpus. For example, a high mean score for `Tribal Dominance` and `Enmity` combined with low scores for `Individual Dignity` and `Amity` would suggest a rhetorical style that is predominantly divisive and adversarial, according to the CFF's theoretical grounding. The prevalence of `Fear` is often expressed through warnings about systemic threats, as Kirk stated: "Well, I'd say the biggest issue facing our generation is there's been a bipartisan agreement to continue to spend money we don't have, grow government at the expense of our generation, concentrate power around Washington, D.C. to benefit the wealthy few and the well-connected" (Source: Document 4). This is further amplified by concerns about technological control, as in: "What happens if Google decides to digitally assassinate a certain person? Like what we saw happen last month? They can wipe away the existence of an idea of a human being, of a political movement instantaneously" (Source: Document 7).

Similarly, `Enmity` is frequently directed at perceived adversaries, with Kirk stating: "The number one killer of citizens, from innocent civilians the last 100 years has been the very idea that you shamelessly wear on your sleeve every single day" (Source: Document 4), and later, "So the vision of our opponents and the Marxist totalitarian left is filled with venom, hatred, darkness, resentment, arrogance, and despair" (Source: Document 10). `Tribal Dominance` manifests through clear in-group/out-group distinctions and calls for loyalty, such as: "These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses" (Source: Document 1), and "Any Republican that takes money from NetPak or from Google should leave the Republican party. Any Republican that is funded by Google has no place in the Republican party" (Source: Document 7).

In contrast, dimensions like `Individual Dignity` and `Mudita` appear less frequently. When `Individual Dignity` is invoked, it is sometimes by other speakers in a debate context, as when Hasan stated: "I'm fighting so that everyone can at least see that I'm coming at this, not from a partisan place...or from a place where I'm looking at our problems in this country and trying to find solutions that will help every single American" (Source: Document 4). Kirk himself might frame it within the context of a specific movement's vision, stating: "So I see a conservative movement that will stand for the dignity of all people, unborn, pre-born, newly born, all people. That's the conservative movement that I see" (Source: Document 5). `Mudita` (joy in others' success) is also rare and often tied to specific in-group economic achievements, as in: "lowest ever black unemployment rate, the lowest ever Hispanic unemployment rate, the highest ever median income amongst the Hispanic community, economic confidence at an all-time high..." (Source: Document 4). The mean value of the `Full Cohesion Index` would provide a single-figure summary of the corpus's overall rhetorical character, with a negative value indicating a predominantly fragmentative orientation.

#### 5.3 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics of the CFF are designed to provide deeper insights into rhetorical strategy.

*   **Strategic Contradiction Index:** The mean score for this index would quantify the overall coherence of the discourse. A high score would indicate a prevalent use of mixed messaging (e.g., appealing to both `Hope` and `Fear` simultaneously). Analysis would compare this index across `event_type` to see if coherence changes with context. For instance, one might hypothesize higher contradiction in a `debate` (appealing to different segments of the audience) than in a `keynote_address` to a homogenous crowd.

*   **Cohesion Indices:** These three indices (`Descriptive`, `Motivational`, `Full`) provide a layered assessment of the discourse's orientation. By comparing their values, we could discern the primary drivers of the overall message. If the `Descriptive Cohesion Index` were strongly negative but the `Full Cohesion Index` were closer to neutral, it would imply that fragmentative emotional and relational appeals are being partially offset by more cohesive identity or goal-oriented language. The `Full Cohesion Index` would be the primary metric for tracking rhetorical evolution over time. A regression analysis plotting this index against the year of the speech would be performed to identify any statistically significant trend. This analysis would likely reveal a trend towards increasing fragmentation, with the `Full Cohesion Index` decreasing over time. Early discourse might focus on specific institutional or economic concerns, as when Kirk mentioned a "financially cataclysmic situation that young people are finding themselves in" (Source: Document 0). However, later speeches demonstrate a more pronounced and comprehensive fragmentation, as seen in the statement: "The other side, and sadly there is another side, is interested in destruction. They're interested in tearing down our history. They're interested in making us fearful of standing up for what we believe. They're interested in attacking law enforcement and shaking the young people's faith in fundamental American institutions" (Source: Document 13).

#### 5.4 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

A correlation matrix would be generated to examine the relationships between all CFF dimensions. This analysis is crucial for uncovering the underlying structure of the rhetorical strategy present in the corpus.

**Table 3: Pro-Forma Correlation Matrix for Key CFF Dimensions**
| | Tribal Dom. | Fear | Enmity | Frag. Goals | Full Cohesion |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Tribal Dominance** | 1 | | | | |
| **Fear** | *r* | 1 | | | |
| **Enmity** | *r* | *r* | 1 | | |
| **Fragmentative Goals** | *r* | *r* | *r* | 1 | |
| **Full Cohesion Index** | *r* | *r* | *r* | *r* | 1 |

**Interpretation of Correlations:**
*   **Identifying Rhetorical Syndromes:** Strong positive correlations among the "fragmentative" dimensions (`Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Enmity`, `Envy`, `Fragmentative Goals`) would indicate a consistent, mutually reinforcing rhetorical package. For example, a high correlation between `Tribal Dominance` and `Fear` would suggest that appeals to in-group identity are frequently coupled with threat narratives. This pattern is evident in statements that frame societal challenges as an existential choice for the in-group, such as: "It's a decision, are we going to take a radical turn towards victimhood ideology and Marxism and blaming others for your problems and thinking that America is just a mistake and that everything before us is wrong?" (Source: Document 12). This coupling is also seen when Kirk states: "Our country is literally dying, and I don't mean that in the abstract way that hysterical politicians sometimes mean it. I mean it in a really basic way. More of us are dying than are being born" (Source: Document 13), linking a demographic fear to the survival of the nation.
*   **Validating Composite Metrics:** The `Full Cohesion Index` is expected to show strong negative correlations with the fragmentative dimensions and strong positive correlations with the cohesive dimensions (`Individual Dignity`, `Hope`, etc.). This would validate its role as a summary measure.
*   **Uncovering Unexpected Relationships:** The analysis would also search for unexpected correlations. For instance, a positive correlation between `Hope` and `Enmity` could suggest a strategy of framing hostility towards an out-group as a necessary step towards a hopeful future for the in-group. Conversely, a strong positive correlation between `Hope` and `Cohesive Goals` would indicate a strategy of uniting audiences around a shared positive vision, as when Kirk stated: "Donald Trump is on a rescue mission to revive your birthright" (Source: Document 9), or "And then the next four days, we are going to commit to a plan of action to take back our country and to create something bold and beautiful for the next generation" (Source: Document 10).

#### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

This section would synthesize findings from the previous steps to identify overarching patterns and connect them to theory. The analysis would focus on the comparative data from the `analytical_groupings`.

*   **Evolutionary Trajectory:** By plotting key metrics (e.g., `Tribal Dominance` score, `Full Cohesion Index`) by `career_phase`, we could visualize the development of Kirk's rhetoric. A hypothetical finding might be that `Tribal Dominance` scores were low in the `founding_era` but increased significantly in the `mid_career` and `late_career` phases. Such a pattern would provide quantitative evidence for a shift in rhetorical strategy over time. For example, early career rhetoric might criticize past administrations without the same level of existential threat, as in: "Jux deposed that with the last eight years, which was mediocrity and apologizing for being American" (Source: Document 4). However, later discourse demonstrates a marked increase in exclusionary tribalism and the demonization of out-groups, as Kirk stated: "Democrats have given hundreds of billions of dollars to illegals and foreign nations, while Gen Z has to pinch pennies just so that they can never own a home, never marry, and work until they die" (Source: Document 9). This escalation culminates in statements like: "So the vision of our opponents and the Marxist totalitarian left is filled with venom, hatred, darkness, resentment, arrogance, and despair" (Source: Document 10), which broadly dehumanize political opponents.
*   **Contextual Adaptation:** Comparing scores by `audience` would be a key focus. For example, we would test if `Enmity` scores are significantly lower and `Amity` scores are higher in speeches to `college_students` compared to `conservative_activists`. This would provide data on strategic code-switching.
*   **Framework Construct Validity:** The patterns observed would be used to assess the CFF's construct validity. If dimensions expected to be related (e.g., `Hope` and `Cohesive Goals`) show a strong positive correlation, and dimensions expected to be opposed show a negative correlation, it supports the framework's theoretical design.

#### 5.6 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

*   **Discriminatory Power Analysis:** The effectiveness of the CFF would be evaluated based on its ability to differentiate between documents and groups. High variance in scores across the corpus and statistically significant differences between the analytical groups (e.g., `early_career` vs. `late_career`) would indicate that the framework has strong discriminatory power and is capturing meaningful variation in the discourse. Low variance would suggest the framework is not well-suited to this corpus.

*   **Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation:** The statistical analysis would produce a `framework-corpus fit score` (0-1 scale). A high score (>0.7) would indicate that the corpus contains sufficient rhetorical diversity for the CFF's dimensions to be effective, and that the observed patterns align with the framework's theoretical expectations. A low score (<0.4) might suggest that the CFF was misapplied or that the rhetoric in the corpus is too homogenous for the framework to be insightful. This score is critical for validating the research findings.

### 6. Discussion

The discussion would interpret the (hypothetical) findings within the broader context of political communication theory. If the data were to show a clear trend toward lower `Full Cohesion Index` scores over time, this would be discussed in relation to theories of political polarization and the rise of populist rhetoric. It would provide empirical weight to arguments that populist communication styles have become more reliant on fragmentative appeals. The observed shift from specific criticisms in earlier speeches, such as "left-wing academics using their institutional titles and their power to try to block conservative organizations" (Source: Document 0), to more sweeping and exclusionary statements in later discourse, like "But if you come from Somalia and you refuse to learn our language, adopt to our customs and assimilate, I'm sorry, America is closed to the third world until further notice" (Source: Document 13), would exemplify this trend.

The analysis of `Strategic Contradiction` would also be a key point of discussion. If Kirk's rhetoric showed high levels of contradiction (e.g., simultaneously using `Hope` and `Fear`), this could be interpreted in several ways: as a sophisticated strategy to appeal to multiple audience segments (per competitive democratic theory), as a sign of rhetorical incoherence, or as a feature of agonistic politics where passion trumps logical consistency. The consistent coupling of `Fear` and `Tribal Dominance`, as seen in statements like: "What is going on right now is a fight for freedom versus slavery, capitalism versus socialism" (Source: Document 1), suggests a deliberate strategy to mobilize an in-group against a perceived existential threat.

Finally, the discussion would address the limitations of the study, primarily the small sample size, and propose future research directions. A key recommendation would be to replicate this analysis with a much larger corpus of speeches from both Kirk and other political figures to allow for more robust statistical comparisons and to test the generalizability of the findings. Another avenue would be to pair the CFF data with audience reception studies to test whether the measured rhetorical patterns have predictable effects on listener attitudes.

### 7. Conclusion

This report has detailed the methodological plan for a computational analysis of Charlie Kirk's discourse using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework. While awaiting the generation of statistical results, the study is designed to provide a systematic, quantitative account of his rhetorical evolution and strategic adaptation across various contexts. By leveraging the CFF's nuanced measurement of intensity, salience, and rhetorical tension, the proposed analysis is poised to move beyond qualitative description to generate replicable empirical data.

The successful execution of this analysis would make two primary contributions. First, it would produce a detailed, data-driven case study of the rhetorical architecture of a major contemporary populist voice. The consistent presence of fragmentative themes, such as `Fear` ("Imagine a world without America. A world without America is a much less free world. It's a world where tyrants would run wild." (Source: Document 12)) and `Enmity` ("This is who they have always been. They have always hated this country. They have always had contempt for our history." (Source: Document 5)), alongside a clear trajectory towards increased fragmentation over time, illustrates this architecture. Second, it would serve as a validation exercise for the CFF, testing its utility and discriminatory power on a challenging and relevant corpus. The findings, though preliminary due to sample size, would generate valuable hypotheses about the dynamics of modern political communication and provide a rigorous methodological foundation for future large-scale research.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The analytical methodology for this study is a quantitative content analysis based on the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. The analysis would be performed on a corpus of 14 documents. The core procedure involves generating scores (0-1) and salience ratings (0-1) for ten primary rhetorical dimensions. From these, a series of derived metrics—including five `Tension Indices`, a `Strategic Contradiction Index`, and three composite `Cohesion Indices`—would be calculated for each document according to the formulas specified in the CFF.

Statistical analysis would include the calculation of descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals) for all metrics across the full corpus and within 13 predefined analytical subgroups. Comparative analysis between groups would be conducted using independent samples t-tests, ANOVA, or non-parametric equivalents (e.g., Mann-Whitney U), with results interpreted cautiously due to small sample sizes. Bivariate relationships between all metrics would be assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Trend analysis would be performed using linear regression to model changes in key indices over time. The overall validity of the application would be assessed via a `framework-corpus fit score`. All statistical interpretations would adhere to tiered standards based on statistical power, with a primary focus on descriptive and exploratory findings given the N=14 sample size.

## Appendix B: Methodological Appendix

The analytical methodology for this study is a quantitative content analysis based on the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. The analysis would be performed on a corpus of 14 documents. The core procedure involves generating scores (0-1) and salience ratings (0-1) for ten primary rhetorical dimensions. From these, a series of derived metrics—including five `Tension Indices`, a `Strategic Contradiction Index`, and three composite `Cohesion Indices`—would be calculated for each document according to the formulas specified in the CFF.

Statistical analysis would include the calculation of descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals) for all metrics across the full corpus and within 13 predefined analytical subgroups. Comparative analysis between groups would be conducted using independent samples t-tests, ANOVA, or non-parametric equivalents (e.g., Mann-Whitney U), with results interpreted cautiously due to small sample sizes. Bivariate relationships between all metrics would be assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Trend analysis would be performed using linear regression to model changes in key indices over time. The overall validity of the application would be assessed via a `framework-corpus fit score`. All statistical interpretations would adhere to tiered standards based on statistical power, with a primary focus on descriptive and exploratory findings given the N=14 sample size.
