  "evidence_extraction": "[\n  \"It's that the left has done everything they possibly can to make sure our generation has never heard why America is the greatest country ever to exist, or why free markets are the most moral, proven and effective economic system ever discovered, or why the Constitution is the greatest political document ever written, or why abortion after birth is immoral and should be rejected in modern and decent society.\",\n  \"This is who they have always been. They have always hated this country. They have always had contempt for our history.\",\n  \"What is America? Is America a place for victims or for victors? Is America a place where you can achieve your dreams or dwell in mediocrity? Is America a socialist place or is America a place that embraces freedom and is a refuge for those that have fled totalitarian Marxist dictatorships?\",\n  \"So I see a conservative movement that will stand for the dignity of all people, unborn, pre-born, newly born, all people. That's the conservative movement that I see.\",\n  \"I don't want to live in the country that the socialist left wants to create. We are not going in the same direction as the Democrat Party. I don't want to live in the country where it's okay to execute a newborn child. That's not the country I want to live in.\",\n  \"If you want to fundamentally transform and destroy this country from within, you do not mean well. You do not have good intentions whatsoever.\",\n  \"the fight that I've decided to engage in is one that will either make or break Western civilization. Because our generation, the next generation, generation Z, if we have a generation that has contempt for America, it doesn't matter if they want higher or low taxes. If we have a generation that hates this country, that believes that we're racist, misogynistic, and homophobic, it doesn't matter. All the rest is irrelevant.\",\n  \"If there is one thing we take away from what this president has taught us, is that when we as a movement fight, we win.\",\n  \"But there is also a lot to be optimistic about. And the conservative movement that I see growing right now is going to be one that understands the left.\",\n  \"That will be the question of the 2020 election. It will be the most important culture war in American history, and we will win. Thank you guys so much.\",\n  \"If you want to get love from the left, be a conservative that attacks Donald Trump. If you want to get on the mainstream networks, be a conservative that writes poorly about this president. You want to get published in all the best newspapers? Be a conservative that attacks the most conservative president in our generation.\",\n  \"But if you want to be loved, you want to get invited to the cocktail parties, you want to get all the right compliments on Twitter, then sure, attack the president.\",\n  \"God bless you, Candace, for what you've done. Totally amazing.\",\n  \"This is who they have always been. They have always hated this country. They have always had contempt for our history.\",\n  \"I'm so sick and tired of saying we should give the benefit of the doubt to liberals and say, well, they mean well. They mean well. If you want to fundamentally transform and destroy this country from within, you do not mean well. You do not have good intentions whatsoever.\",\n  \"I'm so sick and tired of saying that the Democrat Party and liberals mean well. They do not mean well.\",\n  \"No direct evidence found for amity towards out-group; 'we' refers exclusively to the conservative movement.\",\n  \"I don't want to live in the country that the socialist left wants to create. We are not going in the same direction as the Democrat Party. I don't want to live in the country where it's okay to execute a newborn child. That's not the country I want to live in. We do not have different ways of getting to the same place. We have two different places that we want to get to.\",\n  \"And so what we do, the fight that I've decided to engage in is one that will either make or break Western civilization.\",\n  \"There's a culture war brewing right now. And it's a culture war different. It's a different one from the 80s and 90s. It's one fundamental question. What is America?\",\n  \"So I see a conservative movement that will stand for the dignity of all people, unborn, pre-born, newly born, all people. That's the conservative movement that I see.\",\n  \"I see a conservative movement that is thankful to live in America, not angry to live in America. I see a conservative movement that stands with Israel.\"\n]\nTotal quotes in analysis: 22\nTotal quotes in output: 22",
