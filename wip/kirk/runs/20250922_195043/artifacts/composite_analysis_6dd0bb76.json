I think it could help with millennials. But we've got the expert millennial himself, Charlie Kirk, and we'll see what he has to say. He's also fired up about student debt. He says that the government is to blame more Varney after this. Colleges are going to continue to raise their costs because they know students can pay in full and they can pay in full because the [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: federal government keeps on subsidizing their advancement into college]. Remember, [ENMITY: it's big government policies that have created the student loan bubble in this country]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're releasing a new rap radio ad aiming to get that millennial vote.] Charlie Kirk, do you think this tactic will interest the millennials? You know, I think it's interesting. I think it's a good thing that Dr. Carson is starting to use rap and hip hop. [AMITY: Charles, you and I have had discussions] about [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: why should the left own an entire genre of music]. And I think more so than not, [COHESIVE_GOALS: using a very popular genre such as rap to engage young people around his candidacy and his set of ideas could be rather effective]. And you look at Jay-Z, you look at Kanye West, they're all traditionally very, very left-wing figures. They endorsed Obama. They had a very positive implications for his candidacy. I say one, it's a little cheesy, a little corny, but so what? I think it's a good thing. But you know what though, Charlie, [ENMITY: the left has hated luxury rap for years] because I think there's an underlying message that says [HOPE: you don't have to settle for government crumbs]. [MUDITA: You can actually dream of having a G5]. [HOPE: You can dream of it.] And it's not, you know, you got Jay-Z to your point, Drake, Rick Ross, he's the boss. Every time my son listens to music, I hear somebody talking about being [MUDITA: super wealthy, super successful]. And I think that's [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: more of a conservative message these days] than a [ENVY: what was me message in the left]. No, I agree. And it's kind of funny, you know, the expletives aside, with rap music, it's [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: talking about getting a better life for yourself]. And you know, if you talk about an entire culture that they're engaging, most of rap is centered around [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: individuals that, you know, are living in poverty], so on and so forth. They're [HOPE: talking about having better lives for themselves], so on and so forth. And [AMITY: I thank you and I, Charles, when we discuss this], it's important to remember that [COHESIVE_GOALS: they want to improve their livelihood]. And it's [COHESIVE_GOALS: good for Ben Carson for using a genre that can engage them]. And again, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: why should the left, why should progressives own a genre of music]? They just show. All they got to do now is [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: get rid of the misogyny and the violence, right? Okay]. There you go. Exactly. Next one, Charlie. Eureka College, you know that's Ronald Reagan's alma mater. Now being accused of [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: not allowing a conservative group to form on campus]. What are your thoughts on that? Yeah, we're very familiar with the story. Actually, we have a vibrant chapter there at Eureka College. And that was, like you said, Ronald Reagan's alma mater. And this is just another example of [ENMITY: left-wing academics using their institutional titles and their power to try to block conservative organizations and group on campus]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I always say that college administrators are very tolerant of other people's opinions as long as you agree with them]. And you know those diversity bumper stickers, this diversity in all aspects accept diversity of thought. Yeah. And so this is just another example. Charlie, at a place where you think would honor their conservative heritage, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they're disallowing a conservative group from coming on campus], which I think is [ENMITY: wrong and disgraceful]. [ENMITY: The intolerance of the tolerance crowd]. I can't, I never get over that as well. That's exactly right. One last one, Charlie. The [FEAR: student loan crisis] impacts, of course, a majority of millennials right now. You're calling it a game of loans. Why? Well, it is. And it's kind of a playoff of the popular TV show Game of Thrones. And look, 93% of all student loans given out last year were given out by the federal government. [ENMITY: It's big government, not big business, that have created this student loan crisis in this country]. And look, [FEAR: it's a financially cataclysmic situation that young people are finding themselves in]. [ENVY: It's not because of big business that young people are getting into debt. It's not because of, you know, Wall Street bankers.] It's because of [ENMITY: bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. that have created unnatural market interactions] and young people are getting into debt to go study things that don't matter, to go find jobs that don't exist. This is an equation for a generation that will be [FEAR: perpetually financially under water]. Yeah, last year, student loans outpaced inflation yet again. And what would be the solution? Should we [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: get the government out of the way], put a middleman in there, someone that would say, I'm not going to give you a loan for 100 grand to study the secret sex life of plants, that kind of thing? I think a [COHESIVE_GOALS: longer term solution would be getting government out of the student loan business completely]. However, let's start with [COHESIVE_GOALS: allowing young people first and foremost to maybe select a three-year degree instead of a four-year degree. That would cut the cost of college by 25% right off the top]. I think [COHESIVE_GOALS: having these more free market-centric solutions when looking at student loans would be very beneficial] and [COHESIVE_GOALS: getting the federal government out of the business of student loans] is not [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: helping us taxpayers and it\u2019s not helping the students at all]. Charlie Kirk, smart stuff, man. We appreciate it. We'll see you again real soon. Thank you so much. All right. We'll see you in a minute. All right. Thanks. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
