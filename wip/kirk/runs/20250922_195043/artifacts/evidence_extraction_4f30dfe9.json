  "evidence_extraction": "[\n  \"What I see every single day are students that are being taught that our country is racist and bigoted and homophobic and backwards, and they're being taught nothing but negatives about the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.\",\n  \"Alexandria Kasiukortez and Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Presley and Ilan Omar, they are a harbinger for things to come. They have bitter resentment for the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.\",\n  \"America is the greatest country in the history of the world. One of American sovereignty that believes in the working class. A conservative movement that believes in people that shower before work and after work.\",\n  \"And not allow specifically minority communities to be able to get a higher-accessed education, is immoral and it is wrong.\",\n  \"I come with a warning and some insight. What I see on college campuses every single day is no different than what's happening in the Democrat primary right now, which is we have volunteered and sent our next generation to installations of indoctrination to teach the next generation to hate our country.\",\n  \"No, he could win. And I want every conservative activist in this room to get your laughs out of the way and get the mockery out of the way and then get deathly serious, because we should not do what the left did in 2016 and dismiss an outsider populist candidate from thinking that person can't win the White House.\",\n  \"We need to ask our high school seniors, hey, why are you going to college? Not where are you going to college? We need more plumbers and well, there's electricians and HVAC and policemen and firefighters and veterans. And we need far less people that are hypereducated in the humanities and communications and psychology, but they know everything possible about why America is a flawed country\",\n  \"There's a lot of positives I'm here to share with you today. Turning Point USA is now on 2,000 high school and college campuses across the country. And as of today, our Students for Trump organization, our sister organization, has more affiliated chapters in groups than Students for Bernie Sanders.\",\n  \"America is in a renaissance period once again. We've been given a gift from this administration and what they have done.\",\n  \"Culture will get this president reelected. Culture will win back our country. College campuses are the battleground for the hearts and minds for the next generation. I'm going to keep fighting on them from now to November. I know every single one of you are going to do what you can. And we will get this president reelected and take back this country.\",\n  \"I hear people all the time, they say, how on earth could a Bolshevik, could a breadline advocate, could a Marxist be leading the Democrat primary? I say, have you visited a college campus at all in the last 20 years?\",\n  \"These universities are indoctrinating the next generation around ideas of open borders and Marxism. And where Senator Sanders gets his base is a limitless supply of millions and millions of students that are entering our university system and they're being turned into activists.\",\n  \"But the party of Mitt Romney was a party that did not fight. It was a party that wanted to preserve the ruling class.\",\n  \"teach the next generation to hate our country.\",\n  \"They have bitter resentment for the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world. The leading Democrat nominee has nicer things to say about literacy in Cuba than the heroic history of the United States of America. We have a dictator-apologist that is the front-runner of the Democrat Party\",\n  \"They will make up narratives, manufacture stories, and they're already beginning it in ways we could never imagine. They've already tried to impeach him. They spied on his campaign. Pathological resistance started 14 minutes after his inauguration.\",\n  \"It is an honor to be here with so many freedom fighters from all across the country.\",\n  \"And I want every conservative activist in this room to get your laughs out of the way and get the mockery out of the way and then get deathly serious\",\n  \"in solidarity with the grassroots activists of our country, that see that college conservatives are under attack.\",\n  \"teach the next generation to hate our country.\",\n  \"For every single person in this room, please, unless you went to Liberty University or Hillsdale, Liberty's a great college, stop giving money to your alma mater. Stop it. Cut them off.\",\n  \"Are we a country of victims or are we a country of victors?\",\n  \"And if every single conservative in this room got as involved in school board races as we do with national elections, our country would be in a much better place with getting involved in what they're doing at our textbooks, getting involved with what they're doing at the very elementary local level.\",\n  \"This election is going to be a referendum on what is America? Is America a mediocre socialist welfare Marxist country? Of course not. Are we a country of victims or are we a country of victors?\",\n  \"The MAGA doctrine, which is a doctrine of American renewal, revival. One that America is the greatest country in the history of the world. One of American sovereignty that believes in the working class.\"\n]\nTotal quotes in analysis result: 26\nTotal quotes in output: 26",
