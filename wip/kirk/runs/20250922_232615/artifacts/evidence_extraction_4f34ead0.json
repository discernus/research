And only in America would an 18 year old with no qualifications, no money, no connections, no idea what I was doing be able to create an organization that will be part of a movement to help save that very same country. Only in America is that possible.\",\n  \"It's not going to be the United Kingdom. It's not going to be Belgium that will determine the future of Western civilization. It's what happens here. As America goes, the world goes.\",\n  \"He defends the greatest civilization ever created in the history of the world. Not afraid to embrace and defend our flag.\",\n  \"It's a place that doesn't matter where you come from, it doesn't matter what you look like. All that matters is that you embrace that phrase that will be on this seal right here in about a short period of time. You know what that phrase is? On that seal is the phrase, eploribus unum.\",\n  \"Eploribus unum means out of many one. Means one people.\",\n  \"It's a decision, are we going to take a radical turn towards victimhood ideology and Marxism and blaming others for your problems and thinking that America is just a mistake and that everything before us is wrong?\",\n  \"Imagine a world without America. A world without America is a much less free world. It's a world where tyrants would run wild. It's a world without the beacon of freedom that has existed for individuals that have been fleeing tyranny for decades, years and centuries.\",\n  \"If the alternative would have won, oh my goodness. I don't know. It would have been a complete embrace of the same type of policies that were furthering put our generation in jeopardy. We would have economic malaise if not economic depression. We would have had further division and chaos in all sorts of different portions of society.\",\n  \"America is the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.\",\n  \"And now for this particular time, we have things so good that we now want to get rid of it all. I want you to understand that when the president takes this stage, this president has revitalized the spirit of our country.\",\n  \"The problems that we have are problems that prosperity creates. What a great time to be alive where we have more job openings than people to fill those jobs. And that's why for the first time in 12 years wages are finally going up for everyone in this room.\",\n  \"Not only did he beat the rigged media, not only did he beat the Bush dynasty and the Clinton dynasty, not only did he win states they said he has no chance of winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, the blue wall.\",\n  \"The problems that we have are problems that prosperity creates.

Remember the blue wall? Jesus. It worked out great. Not only did he overcome an FBI that was trying to spy on him and was trying to destabilize him from within. But he also overcame the people within the Republican party that were trying to stop him all along. And he overcame the people in the pundit class that were trying to stop him.\",\n  \"Instead of saying, hmm, why did you take out $100,000 in student loans? Personal responsibility would be a nice thing, wouldn't it? Because how many people worked through college to make sure they had no student loans? How many people went to community college first to lower their student loan burden? How many people might have joined the military like the great Rob Smith up here?\",\n  \"Eploribus unum means out of many one. Means one people. Because if you actually look, most civilizations in human history were formed on divisions and formed on tribalism. It was really a first major experiment that said, no, we're going to focus on similarities, not differences.\",\n  \"And they came on a compromise, which is how we got the electoral college and how our system was put together. But there was a recognition and the founding fathers realized this, that it's what unites us, not what divides us, which is what is going to keep this together.\",\n  \"It's a decision, are we going to take a radical turn towards victimhood ideology and Marxism and blaming others for your problems and thinking that America is just a mistake and that everything before us is wrong?\",\n  \"The ideas that are being put forth by these radical leftists.\",\n  \"And so what's so generationally important for everyone in this room, and you're playing a role in this, is that the winners of this culture war will decide the future of Western civilization.\",\n  \"And I started out and I convinced my parents. I said, hey, I want to take a gap year. Something I actually highly recommend for all of you, by the way. I think a gap year can be a very, very constructive thing. And one gap year turned into two gap years, turned into three gap years, turned into four gap years, seven gap years later. Here we are. Not bad. And every day I say America is the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.\",\n  \"Because there's a recognition that this generation will determine the future of our country.\",\n  \"He wakes up every single day focused on a singular thing. How do I do what I said I'm going to do and deliver results for the people who put me here and revitalize the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world?\"\n]\n30\n30",
