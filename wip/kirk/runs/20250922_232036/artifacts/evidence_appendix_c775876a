Here is a curated set of 100 compelling quotes illustrating the core statistical findings for the `kirk` corpus, focusing on Dominant Rhetorical Profile (Fear, Enmity, Tribal Dominance), Strategic Relational Tension, and rhetoric contributing to a negative Full Cohesion Index.

**Observed Shifts Across Timeline (2015-2024):**
Across the provided documents, there's a clear escalation in the intensity and scope of fragmentative rhetoric. Earlier documents (e.g., Doc 0, 1) show foundational "us vs. them" framing, concerns about free speech, and economic anxieties. Mid-timeline documents (e.g., Doc 4, 7, 6, 12) introduce more direct demonization of specific political figures and institutions (Big Tech, "socialist left," "rigged media"), and elevate the conflict to a "culture war" or a fight for "Western civilization." Later documents (e.g., Doc 9, 10, 13) feature even more extreme accusations ("Marxist totalitarian left," "demonic wokeism," "anti-civilization"), explicit calls for aggressive action (deportation), and frame the stakes as an "existential crisis" or the literal "dying" of the country. The strategic "Relational Tension" (mixing high-amity for the in-group with high-enmity for the out-group) becomes increasingly pronounced and sophisticated, often appearing within the same breath or paragraph, highlighting an irreconcilable divide.
