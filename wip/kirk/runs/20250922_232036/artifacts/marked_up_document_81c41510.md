[AMITY: "Good evening. It is an honor to be with you tonight."] My name is Charlie Kirk. I run the [COHESIVE_GOALS: "largest pro-American student organization in the country, Turning Point USA, fighting for the future of our Republic."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "pro-American"] Speaking to you in my personal capacity tonight as a 26-year-old, I see the angst of young people as well as the challenges facing new parents. I am here tonight to tell you, to [FEAR: "warn you"], that [FEAR: "this election is a decision between preserving America as we know it and eliminating everything that we love."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "preserving America as we know it"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "eliminating everything that we love."] For decades, [ENVY: "ruling class leaders in both parties sold out our future to China, to faceless corporations, and to self-serving lobbyists."] [ENVY: "They did it to preserve their own power and enrich themselves, all while rigging the system to hold down the good, decent middle-class patriots striving to build a family and pursue a decent life."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "good, decent middle-class patriots"] All of this changed dramatically in 2015, when [HOPE: "a billionaire named Donald Trump put his own life of luxury on the line."] [COHESIVE_GOALS: "From that moment he came down that famous escalator, he started a movement to reclaim our government from the rotten cartel of insiders that have been destroying our country."] [ENMITY: "rotten cartel of insiders that have been destroying our country."] [FEAR: "destroying our country."] We may not have realized it at the time, but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "Trump is the bodyguard of Western civilization."] [ENMITY: "Trump was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values."] [FEAR: "vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values."] [COHESIVE_GOALS: "President Trump was elected to defend the American way of life."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "The American way of life means you follow the law, you work hard, you honor God, you raise your kids with strong values, and you work to create a civil society."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "The American way of life means you speak your mind without retribution, without being kicked off social media by a self-righteous censor in Silicon Valley."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "It means you can freely practice your religion, and that church is more essential than a casino."] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: "And it means that we judge people on their actions, not on their immutable characteristics."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "The American way of life is being dismantled by a group of bitter, deceitful, vengeful activists who have never built anything in their lives."] [FEAR: "The American way of life is being dismantled"] [ENMITY: "bitter, deceitful, vengeful activists who have never built anything in their lives."] We are kicking doctors off of social media, yet promoting Chinese state-funded propaganda on major tech platforms. [FEAR: "This election is the most critical since 1860, when a man named Lincoln was elected to preserve the union from disintegration."] [FEAR: "This election is not just the most important of our lifetime, it is the most important since the preservation of the Republic in 1865."] [COHESIVE_GOALS: "By re-electing Trump, we will ensure that our kids are raised to love our country and respect its founding fathers, not taught to hate or be ashamed of them."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "love our country and respect its founding fathers, not taught to hate or be ashamed of them."] [HOPE: "We will build monuments to heroes, not burn down our cities."] [HOPE: "We will be a country that rises the higher heights, that dreams big, thinks big, and achieves the impossible."] [COHESIVE_GOALS: "A country that values a remarkable journey, the complexities of our past, but clearly communicates to the next generation that we have to be grateful, not angry, that we live in the United States."] [HOPE: "A country that values a remarkable journey, the complexities of our past, but clearly communicates to the next generation that we have to be grateful, not angry, that we live in the United States."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "We will be a country that makes it easier to have many children, live quiet and peaceable lives, and worship your God without a tyrant getting in the way."] [ENMITY: "without a tyrant getting in the way."] [HOPE: "We will be a country that has its best 100 years ahead."] [HOPE: "We will build a future where America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world."] All of that is within our grasp if we [COHESIVE_GOALS: "secure four more years for the defender of Western civilization, our champion, my friend, the 45th president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump."] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "defender of Western civilization, our champion"] [AMITY: "my friend, the 45th president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump."]
