    "raw_curation_response": "Here is a curated set of 100 compelling quotes illustrating the core statistical findings for the `kirk` corpus, focusing on Dominant Rhetorical Profile (Fear, Enmity, Tribal Dominance), Strategic Relational Tension, and rhetoric contributing to a negative Full Cohesion Index.\n\n**Observed Shifts Across Timeline (2015-2024):**\nAcross the provided documents, there's a clear escalation in the intensity and scope of fragmentative rhetoric. Earlier documents (e.g., Doc 0, 1) show foundational \"us vs. them\" framing, concerns about free speech, and economic anxieties. Mid-timeline documents (e.g., Doc 4, 7, 6, 12) introduce more direct demonization of specific political figures and institutions (Big Tech, \"socialist left,\" \"rigged media\"), and elevate the conflict to a \"culture war\" or a fight for \"Western civilization.\" Later documents (e.g., Doc 9, 10, 13) feature even more extreme accusations (\"Marxist totalitarian left,\" \"demonic wokeism,\" \"anti-civilization\"), explicit calls for aggressive action (deportation), and frame the stakes as an \"existential crisis\" or the literal \"dying\" of the country. The strategic \"Relational Tension\" (mixing high-amity for the in-group with high-enmity for the out-group) becomes increasingly pronounced and sophisticated, often appearing within the same breath or paragraph, highlighting an irreconcilable divide.\n\n---\n\n**Curated Evidence:**\n\n**Document 0**\n*   **Quote:** \"left-wing academics using their institutional titles and their power to try to block conservative organizations\"\n    *   **Statistical Relevance:** Enmity, Fear, Negative Full Cohesion Index\n    *   **Strength:** 5\n*   **Quote:** \"intolerance of the tolerance crowd\"\n    *   **Statistical Relevance:** Enmity, Negative Full Cohesion Index\n    *   **Strength:** 4\n*   **Quote:** \"financially cataclysmic situation that young people are finding themselves in\"\n    *   **Statistical Relevance:** Fear\n    *   **Strength:** 5\n*   **Quote:** \"the left has hated luxury rap for years because I think there\u2019s an underlying message that says you don\u2019t have to settle for government crumbs.\"\n    *   **Statistical Relevance:** Enmity, Tribal Dominance\n    *   **Strength:** 4\n*   **Quote:** \"try to block conservative organizations and group on campus\"\n    *   **Statistical Relevance:** Enmity, Fear, Negative Full Cohesion Index\n    *   **Strength:** 5\n\n**Document 1**\n*   **Quote:** \"These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses.\"\n    *   **Statistical Relevance:** Relational Tension, Tribal Dominance, Enmity\n    *   **Strength:** 5\n*   **Quote:** \"What is going on right now is a fight for freedom versus slavery, capitalism versus socialism.\"\n    *   **Statistical Relevance:** Fear, Enmity, Tribal Dominance, Negative Full Cohesion Index\n    *   **Strength:** 5\n*   **Quote:** \"We are banding together to fight for the core values that made Western civilization so great.\"\n    *   **Statistical Relevance:** Tribal Dominance, Relational Tension\n    *   **Strength:** 5\n*   **Quote:** \"Free speech is being silenced, unlike any other time in human history.\"\n    *   **Statistical Relevance:** Fear\n    *   **Strength:** 5\n*   **Quote:** \"And never before in human history has a cohort of a generation so shamelessly enjoyed the fruits of the free market while simultaneously using those devices to bash it.\"\n    *   **Statistical Relevance:** Enmity, Negative Full Cohesion Index\n    *   **Strength:** 4\n*   **Quote:** \"They would rather silence conservatives.
