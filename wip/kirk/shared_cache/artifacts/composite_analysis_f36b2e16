[AMITY: It is an honor to be with you tonight.] My name is Charlie Kirk. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I run the largest pro-American student organization in the country, Turning Point USA, fighting for the future of our Republic.] Speaking to you in my personal capacity tonight as a 26-year-old, I see the angst of young people as well as the challenges facing new parents.

From that moment he came down that famous escalator, he started a movement to [COHESIVE_GOALS: reclaim our government] from the [ENMITY: rotten cartel of insiders that have been destroying our country.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: reclaim our government from the rotten cartel of insiders that have been destroying our country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We may not have realized it at the time, but Trump is the bodyguard of Western civilization.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Trump was elected to protect our families] from the [ENMITY: vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values.] [FEAR: Trump was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: President Trump was elected to defend the American way of life.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The American way of life] means you follow the law, you work hard, you honor God, you raise your kids with strong values, and you work to create a civil society. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The American way of life] means you speak your mind without retribution, without being kicked off social media by a self-righteous censor in Silicon Valley. It means you can freely practice your religion, and that church is more essential than a casino.
