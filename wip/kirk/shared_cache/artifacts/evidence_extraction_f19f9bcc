Without a vision, the people perish, is what it says in the Scriptures. And I had the opportunity to travel the country and talk to lots of different people, and we have been lacking a coherent vision of what we as conservatives believe in and what we are fighting for. Now, we know what the bad guys are fighting for\",\n    \"One of the reasons why I believe we are going to win is because our young people are tougher than the liberals. Our opposition is fragile.\",\n    \"We want a country where kids are taught that if you judge somebody on the basis of skin, you are a racist. And we should instead care about character, not the complexion of somebody's skin.\",\n    \"So the vision of our opponents and the Marxist totalitarian left is filled with venom, hatred, darkness, resentment, arrogance, and despair. When you go at length and you're going to hear about it from our amazing speakers about how the totalitarian left has taken over our institutions, how they're teaching our children this vile garbage of critical race theory and this woke nonsense. We know what they want. They want power, they want control, they want uniformity, and they want submission.\",\n    \"One of the things that the totalitarian left wants to do for our society is to destroy the distinction between God and man, between man and woman, between good and evil. They want to blur the lines that allow us to live in a free and stable and civil society.\",\n    \"what gives me hope is that what we see on these campuses is a generation that understands the only way you beat the left is you never give up and you never give them an inch, period.\",\n    \"We are the recipients of a nation that we did not build, but we inherited it. We are going to celebrate that nation. And then the next four days, we are going to commit to a plan of action to take back our country and to create something bold and beautiful for the next generation.\",\n    \"Young people say, well, it's just too expensive to get married and have children. It's just too difficult. Or, I don't want to participate in the patriarchy. What a robbery of joy.\",\n    \"You look at every one of the things they're trying to teach, like, oh, you don't need kids. You could be happy with, you know, video games and some sort of promotion at your corporate job. Maybe that is for you. But one of the reasons why our generation is very sad is the most depressed, suicidal, alcohol addicted and drug addicted generation in history is the stuff that gives you meaning they have been told is evil.\",\n    \"Praise God. To think that children, young people are growing up and being told that there's something oppressive or tyrannical about the covenant between a man and a woman and having children.\",\n    \"God bless Elon Musk for what he has done by purchasing Twitter.\",\n    \"Now, we know what the bad guys are fighting for, and a movement with no vision, we're nothing more than just a gang, just a random group of people with kind of shared ideas and shared values\",\n    \"No, no, no. The bad guys would love nothing more than for us the next couple of days to have a pity party of misery and say, feel sorry for us and maybe, you know, it'll work out in the future.\",\n    \"Great to see all of you. I just want to compliment our Turning Point staff for the promotion, the marketing, the branding of this world-class event.\",\n    \"Introduce yourself to a Turning Point student. Go up to one of our booths. You will see some of the wisest, most courageous, most well educated, the most committed citizens that you could come of any age whatsoever.\",\n    \"So the vision of our opponents and the Marxist totalitarian left is filled with venom, hatred, darkness, resentment, arrogance, and despair.\",\n    \"No, no, no. The bad guys would love nothing more than for us the next couple of days to have a pity party of misery and say, feel sorry for us and maybe, you know, it'll work out in the future.\",\n    \"And if there is anything our movement does, it is to tell the young people in this room and across the country, it's okay to get married and have children. In fact, you should get married and have children.\",\n    \"And then the next four days, we are going to commit to a plan of action to take back our country and to create something bold and beautiful for the next generation.\"\n  ]\n}\n```",
