As America goes, the world goes.\"\n  ],\n  \"individual_dignity\": [\n    \"What has made America so unique is it's a place that doesn't matter where you come from, it doesn't matter what you look like. All that matters is that you embrace that phrase that will be on this seal right here in about a short period of time. You know what that phrase is? On that seal is the phrase, eploribus unum. It's the first thing on our presidential seal. And for those of you that don't speak Latin, that's okay, I don't either. So I'll tell you what it means. Eploribus unum means out of many one. Means one people.\"\n  ],\n  \"fear\": [\n    \"It's a decision, are we going to take a radical turn towards victimhood ideology and Marxism and blaming others for your problems and thinking that America is just a mistake and that everything before us is wrong? Or are we going to say, America has made mistakes, but America is not a mistake. Imagine a world without America. A world without America is a much less free world.

Wrong about everything.\",\n    \"Colin Kaepernick, who, for those of you that follow football, was so such an underwhelming athletic figure that he couldn't even make the roster at the San Francisco 49ers and then tries to play the victim as if it's some sort of institutional oppression against him.\"\n  ],\n  \"mudita\": [\n    \"We love our veterans, right? So, in closing, I'll say this. History has inflection points. And you're now, by being here in this room, part of one of those chapters of an inflection point, where you have a president who wakes up every single day focused on a singular thing.

And every day I say America is the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world. In the history of the world. And only in America would an 18 year old with no qualifications, no money, no connections, no idea what I was doing be able to create an organization that will be part of a movement to help save that very same country. Only in America is that possible.\",\n    \"And so very shortly you guys will be able to hear from him himself. Now the room the room the room will be sealed off in about a couple minutes.
