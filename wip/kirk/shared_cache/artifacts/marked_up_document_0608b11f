Good evening. It is an honor to be with you tonight. My name is Charlie Kirk. I run the [COHESIVE_GOALS: largest pro-American student organization] in the country, Turning Point USA, [COHESIVE_GOALS: fighting for the future of our Republic]. Speaking to you in my personal capacity tonight as a 26-year-old, I see the angst of young people as well as the challenges facing new parents. I am here tonight to tell you, to [FEAR: warn you], that [FEAR: this election is a decision between preserving America as we know it and eliminating everything that we love]. For decades, [ENVY: ruling class leaders in both parties sold out our future] to China, to faceless corporations, and to self-serving lobbyists. [ENVY: They did it to preserve their own power and enrich themselves], all while [ENVY: rigging the system to hold down the good, decent middle-class patriots striving to build a family and pursue a decent life]. All of this changed dramatically in 2015, when a billionaire named Donald Trump put his own life of luxury on the line. From that moment he came down that famous escalator, he started a movement to [COHESIVE_GOALS: reclaim our government] from the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: rotten cartel of insiders] that have been [ENMITY: destroying our country]. We may not have realized it at the time, but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Trump is the bodyguard of Western civilization]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Trump was elected to protect our families] from the [ENMITY: vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: President Trump was elected to defend the American way of life]. The American way of life means you follow the law, you work hard, you honor God, you raise your kids with strong values, and you work to create a civil society. The American way of life means you speak your mind without retribution, without being kicked off social media by a self-righteous censor in Silicon Valley. It means you can freely practice your religion, and that church is more essential than a casino. And [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it means that we judge people on their actions, not on their immutable characteristics]. The American way of life is being [FEAR: dismantled] by a [ENMITY: group of bitter, deceitful, vengeful activists who have never built anything in their lives]. We are [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: locking up pastors while releasing violent criminals from prison]. We are [FEAR: kicking doctors off of social media], yet [FEAR: promoting Chinese state-funded propaganda on major tech platforms]. This election is the [FEAR: most critical since 1860, when a man named Lincoln was elected to preserve the union from disintegration]. This election is not just the most important of our lifetime, it is the [FEAR: most important since the preservation of the Republic in 1865]. By [HOPE: re-electing Trump], [HOPE: we will ensure that our kids are raised to love our country and respect its founding fathers, not taught to hate or be ashamed of them]. [HOPE: We will build monuments to heroes], not burn down our cities. [HOPE: We will be a country that rises the higher heights, that dreams big, thinks big, and achieves the impossible]. [HOPE: A country that values a remarkable journey, the complexities of our past], but clearly communicates to the next generation that [HOPE: we have to be grateful, not angry, that we live in the United States]. [HOPE: We will be a country that makes it easier to have many children, live quiet and peaceable lives, and worship your God without a tyrant getting in the way]. [HOPE: We will be a country that has its best 100 years ahead]. [HOPE: We will build a future where America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world]. All of that is within our grasp if we secure four more years for the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: defender of Western civilization], [AMITY: our champion, my friend], the 45th president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.
