Hello! This is so amazing. [AMITY: Thank you guys so much for coming out.] I hope we get to keep the energy up. I know it's 8 p.m. but we're feeling really energized. [AMITY: Candace, the last couple days have been interesting.] I think two days ago our day started at 3:45 a.m. West Coast time. [AMITY: We did Fox and Friends together for the first time, which was really exciting.] Went back to the hotel. It had nothing to do so we decided to run a couple miles. Go do the Dennis Prager show, the Ben Shapiro show. Go meet with a couple donors, then go film a documentary at UCLA. Drive to Orange County through three hours of traffic. Raise a little bit more money, do another TV interview, get three hours of sleep and do it all over again. That's what we're doing. [COHESIVE_GOALS: That's kind of a typical day at Turning Point USA.] So [AMITY: we've got energy. You guys have got to have energy.]\\n\\nAnd now I guess it's really changed up. Well, so here's the story of how I met Candace Owens. By the way, this is my fifth Western conservative summit, which is interesting because that's like one fifth of my life. Okay. I started coming here when I was 19 years old, believe it or not, and they were nice enough to have a platform. John Andrews back then and Senator Bill Armstrong, amazing hero for conservatism. [COHESIVE_GOALS: This has always been, I say this, this is the best conservative event west of the Mississippi, if not the best conservative event of the year.] [AMITY: I mean, the energy, the people is absolutely terrific. What a wonderful platform.] And for those of you that don't know, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I started this organization Turning Point USA when I was 18 years old.] [AMITY: Similar to Candace, I kind of had an unusual path to this whole thing.] My life before that, I wanted to go to the United States Military Academy at West Point. I didn't get in and it was the best thing that never happened to me. [HOPE: I love my country. I love freedom] and [FEAR: I was so disturbed about the direction our generation was heading because of the indoctrination in our schools, because of the misrepresentation of our history and the lack of a conservative infrastructure on high school and college campuses.] So I went to my parents and I said, I'm going to do this thing for six months. I'm not going to go to college. That did not go well. I don't recommend doing it that way if you don't want to go to college. But as I like to say, it's been a long six months. It's been six years now that we've been at this. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We had our six year anniversary a couple days ago. We are now on 1,300 college and high school campuses across the country, which is just amazing.] [HOPE: We are going to have over 1,000 young women leaders at our Young Women's Leadership Summit next week in Dallas.] [AMITY: Those of you that are attending, we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We'll have over 5,000 young conservatives in Palm Beach. We already have Tucker Carlson confirmed and other huge names.] So what's happening, [AMITY: and Candace and I have seen this firsthand,] is that [HOPE: there is a movement happening on college campuses. And it's a movement for freedom,] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: a movement away from political correctness to reject the Marxist ideas that have so terribly plagued our civilization over the last 100 years.] [FEAR: So I met Candace at an event back in November. And Candace, in fact, check me if I'm wrong. I think I hired you four and a half minutes after I met you.]\\n\\nThree and a half minutes. It was very aggressive. He was like, you sit down, stay here. I'm going to get you a contract. I don't need you to sign the contract and get it back to me. All right, sign right here. Keep signed. It's OK. You never heard of it. Just right here. Just write your name. I just need you to move your finger. And the deal was done. [HOPE: And the rest, as we say, is history in the making. It's history.] [AMITY: And for those of you that follow kind of our path and our journey closely, it's been quite seven or eight months.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: Turning Point was on an amazing trajectory at the time. And now it's just gone exponential.] [HOPE: And I believe today, what I knew back then, Candace is unlike any other conservative voice that we've encountered. And because she is confident, she's articulate, she's charismatic, she's fierce, she's funny, she's direct.] And what she has done is she has successfully been able to go between the worlds of culture and politics, something that conservatives are not supposed to do. Now let's take a little blast from the past here, Candace, if this is OK. Everyone was so surprised about the Kanye West thing. I was surprised. In fact, my allowed to say I probably shouldn't. When I first met Candace, I was not exactly a pop culture aficionado.\\n\\nA little more culture now, I'm proud to say. So, [AMITY: but Candace was in my ear from the minute I hired her. I'll never forget the dinner I had, the night I hired her. I was like, I probably should get to know the person I just hired, you know, probably a good thing.] And she was just getting in. [HOPE: She said Kanye West is going to be the one that's going to break through culture. Kanye West is going to be the one that's going to come out as a Trump supporter.] So, I think we have a video of this August of 2017. Let's play the video of Candace on our good friend with Dave Rubin on the Rubin Report telling the future. **[VIDEO CLIP - CANDACE OWENS ON RUBIN REPORT]:**\\n\\nAnd so, [AMITY: we embarked on this amazing journey.] So I got a call from Candace Owens two days after [AMITY: we did an amazing event at UCLA.] By the way, [AMITY: Candace and I are the first duo of conservative speakers to speak at UCLA, UC Berkeley, and Stanford in one semester.]\\n\\nAnd live to tell about it. [HOPE: Survivors, the ultimate survivors.]\\n\\nAnd so, [AMITY: Candace beautifully handled the Black Lives Matter Protester from UCLA.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Someone who thought they were oppressed, but they did also go to UCLA. So that's a little bit of a tough argument to make.] Look, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you go to UCLA, I love this Harvard black-only graduation ceremony. Self-imposed segregation. Self-imposed? It's unbelievable.] And look, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it might not be politically or correct. If you go to Harvard and you're black, you're not oppressed. I mean, just give me a break. I mean, seriously. You're like the luckiest person in the world.] Nevertheless, [AMITY: Candace and I spoke at UCLA. We had a couple clips that started to go viral, one on Friday night.] So I got a phone call very early Saturday morning from Candace. And she's in tears. Candace, what's wrong? And she says, Kanye West just tweeted about me. Hold on. That's the one that... Oh, Kim Kardashian. Okay, she's ready to Kim Kardashian. Got it. Okay. What? What do you mean tweeted about you? Has it tweeted in like 18 months? And she's like, no, you don't understand. [HOPE: He tweeted, quote, I love the way Candace Owens thinks. It's like, I... What? You know? And so, as they say, the hurricane started just about at that moment.]\\n\\nThat's exactly right. And so then Candace gets contacted by Team Yeezy. [HOPE: And this whole kind of movement continued.] I think we have a picture of this amazing day in history. That was my birthday, by the way. I somehow was involved in. That's birthday ever. I'll tell you the funny story. The picture will become out. There it is right here. Charlie's thinking, is this the one married to Beyonce? I knew by then. [AMITY: Candace was nice enough to include me in the meeting.] Now, [ENMITY: people understood people. I call them the blue check mob, you know, the conservative pundits and journalists.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They understood why Candace was there. They're like, what the heck is Charlie Kirk doing meeting Kanye West?] So that was fun. But [AMITY: that moment was so defining because Candace and Kanye hit it off immediately. And they found out that they had so much in common to want to improve the black community.] And [AMITY: we also found out that we have many things that we don't have in common. And we celebrate the fact that we don't have to agree on everything.] And that's what it's about. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: It's about destroying a monolith. It's about encouraging black people to think independently and to look at policies and to talk about things that will actually help them and to remove emotion from the equation.]\\n\\nSo I would say that this semester it's always been an uphill battle. [ENMITY: Charlie and I go on to these campuses and we've got these Black Lives Matter protesters. We've got Antifa with their cool scarves. I don't know what they're doing. They're such courageous folks that we can't see their face. That's a real, it's a great existence.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: every single person in the world goes through pain and hurt. You're not special. Every single person here has gone through something.] And so what we're about to show you is really powerful stuff. And Candice can now show evidence of the black defection from the Democrat Party happening on the very grassroots level. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: And so her ability, her capacity to communicate, her language has now been inserted. Kanye West used her language, get off the plantation in one of his rap battle songs against TI. And this idea of getting off the Democrat plantation is so important.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: And as we always say, no community has been harmed more by Democrat policies or politicians than black America.] [ENVY: Yet they keep on voting for those same policies and politicians.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: If you show me an American ghetto, I'll show you where Democrats in control. Oakland, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit. The most murderous, most broken cities are run by Democrats.] So this clip right here happened just 14 days ago at Stanford University and it is so powerful it goes beyond words. So let's play the next video. **[VIDEO CLIP - STANFORD UNIVERSITY STUDENT]:**\\n\\nNever want to miss an opportunity. I was like, let's get this guy information. **[END OF VIDEO CLIP]**\\n\\nAnd so [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: 95% of black people vote for Democrats nationwide. Despite what we said, their policies and their politicians continually keeping them downtrodden and poor and dependent.] [ENVY: Now it's very interesting when you have 95% of people voting a certain way, that political party doesn't have to compete or earn your vote anymore. So they just take it for granted.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's why these communities continue to go into ruin.] And so make, if you want one piece of evidence to show a liberal in your life, I'm sure there's some liberals in this audience somewhere. [AMITY: God bless you. We'll pray for you as we say.] [FEAR: If you want one piece of evidence, you look at the State of the Union by Donald Trump.] [HOPE: By the way, is our president not doing an unbelievable job? Can we just say that? Against all odds. Against all odds.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We'll get there in a second. You look at the State of the Union where he says we have record low black unemployment.] And you would think that the congressional black caucus would be just up in arms and cheering. [ENVY: And they sat emotionless because they know. What do they know, Candace?]\\n\\n[ENVY: 100% true. And that's the problem is that these black politicians have had their pockets lined to keep black people dependent.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That is just the truth. The truth is that when there were less black politicians in office, black people were doing better in America. When there was only 1500, today we have over 10,000 black politicians in office. And we had a black president for two terms and the black community is worse off.] Explain to me how. Well, and so here's the opportunity is that [FEAR: the left, as they always do, they way overplay their hand. And they are failing to recognize the progress that this president has made for black America and for urban America.] [HOPE: This president has done more in 18 months for black America than Obama did for eight years. Make no mistake.]\\n\\nSo of all the lines I say on campus, the one that for whatever reason I get somewhat of the most opposition, I say, God is real. How could you believe that? That's the worst thing. Well, because [FEAR: we talked about this all the time tribe, but the left has done is they have wanted people to believe that the government was God, that the government could fix all their problems, that it wasn't family, that it wasn't religion, that it wasn't caring about your children, that it was the government and a policy that was going to help people succeed.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: In many ways, Charlie and I firmly believe that the left has tried to create the idea that the government is God in America.]\\n\\nThat's correct. That's correct. [COHESIVE_GOALS: But as we like to say, it's time for a turning point. It's time for a turning point. That sounds like an interesting thing.] So we're on these campuses. [AMITY: We have an attorney point activist out there. We see a couple. We love you guys. Yeah. Doing amazing, amazing work. These are the grassroots warriors on the front lines.] NPR did an hour-long special on one of our fights, and actually did a pretty good job, even by NPR standards. It was very, very fair. To get fair press, the best piece is written about us, BBC in the London Times. I mean, it's absolutely incredible. [ENMITY: The media is coming after our movement, coming after us, and our personal way. Our enemies make no mistake. We are up against the media, as the media versus the people, versus the American people.] [HOPE: But look, we're willing to take on that battle.]\\n\\nAnd make no mistake, [HOPE: America is the greatest country in the history of the world. 100% Make no mistake. We are the luckiest people ever to live to live at this time in this country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are 5% of the world's population yet we represent over 80% of the economic activity. We are the most benevolent country. We gave away over $500 billion voluntarily to charity last year. That's the GDP of Hungary, Bulgaria, Belgium, Spain, and Switzerland combined, that we voluntarily gave away on top of our U.S. tax dollar payment. America is the only country in the history of the world to voluntarily send our own troops and our own service people to go die for the rights and the freedoms of others. Look no further than the Korean War. Could you point to any other country that would send 50,000 of their own men to go die for the freedom and the creation of another sovereign country? Never existed in the history of the world. South Korea exists today because of the blood, sweat, soil, and sacrifice of American servicemen and military.] [AMITY: Yes, thank you. And a round of applause for America, right? And...]\\n\\nThat's right. [FEAR: And the ideas that are being taught in our universities and in our high schools are a direct threat to the future of our country] and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: look no further than the political success of Bernie Sanders. It would have been absolutely unconscionable that an outward socialist would get millions and millions of votes in the Democrat primary. In fact, he actually won the nomination of Hillary Clinton and wouldn't have stole it from him. It's an unbelievable thing to think about. That Marxism has now become mainstream. That hating America has now become popularized by Hollywood, by media, by the educational elites.] [ENMITY: And so there has to be a defining moment and I believe firmly now we are the boots on the ground and yet we look up and we say, wow, we have a president that is willing to fight for this country and what we believe in.] [HOPE: And that is something that I think we've had in a very, very long time. You look at the failures of Bush, look at the failures of Clinton. It was just kind of the same globalist narrative and the retreat from American exceptionalism. So this is a defining moment. The Democrats are going all in. They're going all in in 2018.]\\n\\nSo in closing, folks, [AMITY: please continue to support this amazing conference, the Western conservative summit. Jeff Hunt's a good buddy. He's just working his tail off. We love him to death.] And the Centennial Institute and the Colorado Christian University and this state is one. [FEAR: This can go either way. I'd hate to see this become a blue state.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's always been known as a purple state. But the left's forces are out and full here in this state.] [FEAR: But we're really at that defining cultural battle where we can go one of two ways.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We can either recommit to our founding values of free enterprise, individual liberty and respect for Western civilization. We can go a completely different direction. One that deteriorates the individual, one that destroys the Judeo-Christian ethic, one that absolutely eliminates the private property rights and you name it, and turns America into a society of victims and not victors.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: And I always ask people the question, would you rather have America look like California or Texas?] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think I know how the room would answer to the question.] [HOPE: So we're just getting started. We have our Young Women's Leadership Summit, our Young Latino Leadership Summit, our High School Leadership Summit, our Chapter Leadership Summit. We're adding 50 staff this summer. We've got our Young Black Leadership Summit. We're doing 35 campus stops for the midterms in all key states.] [ENMITY: Our haters better have a lot of stamina because we really are just getting started. Because if you think you're going to outwork Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk, you're wrong because we're going to win and they're going to lose.] [HOPE: Thank you guys. Thank you guys.]\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
