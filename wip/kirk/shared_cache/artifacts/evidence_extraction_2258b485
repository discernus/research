So that's a little bit of a tough argument to make.\",\n    \"it might not be politically or correct. If you go to Harvard and you're black, you're not oppressed. I mean, just give me a break.

It would have been absolutely unconscionable that an outward socialist would get millions and millions of votes in the Democrat primary.
