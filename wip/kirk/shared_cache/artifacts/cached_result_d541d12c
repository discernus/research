Honored to be here this morning. So I'm from Illinois, and the really cool thing about Illinois, unlike most states, is we have term limits. One term in office, one term in jail. It's a little bit different than most. So I was born and raised in Chicago. My grandmother was a lifelong Republican. She passed away in the early 90s, and she's been voting Democrat ever since. So we know the whole process of vote early and vote off, and I wish I could say that [ENMITY: what's going on in Washington, D.C. right now is anything but Chicago mob politics.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: But you're seeing exactly what we have lived through over the last 30, 40 years.] So I run a national student organization that advocates for free markets and limited government on college and high school campuses across the country. And a lot of our young activists are here at the conference. They'll be wearing red polos, or if you see the big signs that say, I know some people think it's harsh language, but wait till you hear what they say to us. Big government sucks. That's us. And they're walking around. Please engage them. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses.] [FEAR: These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses.] [ENMITY: These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses.] So give them some recognition. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: What is going on right now is a fight for freedom versus slavery, capitalism versus socialism.] [FEAR: What is going on right now is a fight for freedom versus slavery, capitalism versus socialism.] [ENMITY: What is going on right now is a fight for freedom versus slavery, capitalism versus socialism.] But especially amongst younger Americans, [ENVY: what I find to be most dreadfully ironic is you see a lot of these young people embrace Bernie Sanders.] [ENVY: And never before in human history has a cohort of a generation so shamelessly enjoyed the fruits of the free market while simultaneously using those devices to bash it.] And so you have young folks that are at Bernie Sanders rallies. Socialism, this is what democracy looks like. And then they turn around and, hey, do you want to go take an Uber to go to Starbucks? And let's watch Netflix later. And tweet about that too. And I just can't stand this capitalism thing. It's just so bad. I can't believe my Amazon Prime didn't come in 24 hours or less. Who are these people? Because [ENVY: they've never been taught what free markets really is.] And so it's rather remarkable. And one of the founding fathers, I think, was Thomas Jefferson, liberty breeds apathy. And our generation has it so good and has devices improving so fast than our standard of living rising so dramatically that we know nothing but to see our lives get better. And they just think this happens. The younger generation needs to be reminded and told and quite frankly educated that [HOPE: free markets and free people are a necessary precedent to people's lives getting better.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: free markets and free people are a necessary precedent to people's lives getting better.] And [HOPE: not every country in the world is able to experience that sort of flourishing, that prosperity, and that sort of standard of living increase.] [MUDITA: not every country in the world is able to experience that sort of flourishing, that prosperity, and that sort of standard of living increase.] And so one of my favorite things to do is, we met some friends out there. There were a lot of interesting characters out there with Donald Trump signs. So we went out there and made a couple of friends. And you start talking to them. We just started chanting like, Venezuela, they didn't quite get that. So just right over their head. They're like, everything's free over there. Yeah, they have nothing to give out. And no toilet paper, and no beer, and no food, and they're all dying. But anyway, so you see a lot of these young college socialists. And the one thing that we have found is, despite their seeming fervor and intensity for these beliefs and these ideas, is as soon as they are confronted with truth, it is incredible how quick the whole socialist facade drops. And that is exactly what Turning Point USA is doing on college campuses across the country every single day. [AMITY: With passionate and energetic young people fighting against the socialistic dominance on our college campuses.] So when I first started this organization in 2012, and we've been blessed with absolutely incredible staff and leaders that have invested in our organization and believed that this sort of enterprise could grow. I went to a college campus about nine months ago, and I encountered something I didn't even know existed. And I hope to educate everyone in this room. And some of you might have heard of it. This thing called Safe Spaces and Free Speech Zones. Yeah, so when I first started this organization in 2012, I never had the privilege or lack thereof of actually going to college. So I was not aware of this. So I go on a college campus nine months ago, and I start walking by and they say, we start doing a little demonstration in favor of free markets. And one of those mall cops from the university comes up to us and he says, no, no, no, you have to be in the Free Speech Zone. Excuse me, I thought he was like kidding around. Like what, what? No, no, you gotta go to the zone. You have a permit? Permit, and then one of our kind of more sarcastic activists who's here in this room, he said, hey, listen, okay, the First Amendment is this entire country. It's not a zone, thank you, the mall cop, then take that very kindly. And really, you boil it down. What's going on in our college campuses is they're restricting the First Amendment to pre-prescribed boxes and areas. You can only say certain words and you can't trigger, those, that's a new thing that is being used in our college campuses. You can't say words that are microaggressions. At a university, at University of Wisconsin, I think Eau Claire, they say, if you use the term hardworking Americans, or if you work hard enough, you can succeed, that is a microaggression to people that might not have been able to experience that luxury. I'm not kidding, you can't, and the Leadership Institute's campus reform has done amazing work helping unearth a lot of this because [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the biases that are going on in our universities, and what is really going on here, is the left over 40, 50, 60 years, is they have staked the claim in higher education unlike any other enterprise in the country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The left controls higher education, and they know that. They've been incredibly successful at indoctrinating our youth.] [ENVY: The left controls higher education, and they know that. They've been incredibly successful at indoctrinating our youth.] Sure, they control media, I hear that all the time. Oh, what are we gonna do about the media? They control all the institutions of influence, but the one that matters most, and the one that everyone in this room has to be most focused on, is higher education. Because where do you think the journalists learn all that stuff? Where do you think the Rachel Maddow's gotten doctrinated? Hillary Clinton was a conservative until she went to college. Yes, she was a Goldwater girl, then she went to Wellesley, and yeah, that ended. And people don't actually realize, the first internship that Hillary Clinton had when she went to Washington, DC, was for Ed Fulner, who then started the Heritage Foundation. She was a conservative, and that changed rather quickly. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The left controls higher education, and they know that. They've been incredibly successful at indoctrinating our youth.] [FEAR: The left controls higher education, and they know that. They've been incredibly successful at indoctrinating our youth.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: And now what they know, they know to be true, is that there is a resistance movement of liberty-minded, freedom-centric student organizations that are banding together to fight back against these very, very dangerous ideas.] [FEAR: And now what they know, they know to be true, is that there is a resistance movement of liberty-minded, freedom-centric student organizations that are banding together to fight back against these very, very dangerous ideas.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: And now what they know, they know to be true, is that there is a resistance movement of liberty-minded, freedom-centric student organizations that are banding together to fight back against these very, very dangerous ideas.] And so instead of trying to actually debate and have a discussion and dialogue, they want nothing. [ENMITY: They do not want to ever have a discussion. They would rather silence conservatives. They'd rather put them in a box. They'd rather say that you're offending people, that you're triggering them, that you have microaggressions.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: They do not want to ever have a discussion. They would rather silence conservatives. They'd rather put them in a box. They'd rather say that you're offending people, that you're triggering them, that you have microaggressions.] It's much more easier than to actually use facts and logic and be able to defend your perspectives, your opinions, and your beliefs. And this is what's going on in our college campuses. [FEAR: Free speech is being silenced, unlike any other time in human history.] An organization such as FIRE, the Leadership Institute, our organization Turning Point USA, [AMITY: we are banding together to fight for the core values that made Western civilization so great.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: we are banding together to fight for the core values that made Western civilization so great.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we are banding together to fight for the core values that made Western civilization so great.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we are banding together to fight for the core values that made Western civilization so great.] Because [FEAR: that is exactly what we're up against on our college campuses.] One of the final things I'll say with you today, which I think is something that I believe was our biggest failure of the last 10 months. And I would be remiss not to mention it. And so again, I had the great privilege of going on some college campuses and encountering students that were wearing those Bernie Sanders shirts. And I just, I couldn't resist myself a couple months ago, four, five months ago, I went up to him. I said, okay, you love Bernie. What do you love most about Bernie? And he went on this whole tirade. I said, well, what do you dislike about Republicans? Republicans are just old white men. I just like Bernie, 74, think he's white. And then I kind of got into this rant. And then I just kind of realized it in more research. How many people in this room knew that the Republican field that ran was the youngest and most diverse presidential field in American history? Does anyone actually ever say that? Ever say that? [MUDITA: We had more candidates under the age of 50 run for president than any other time in American history. Four. There's been four Latinos ever to run for president. Two of them were in this election cycle. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. We had the first Indian-American. We had one of the only women ever to run for president, and probably the most qualified woman ever to run for president in the United States, and Carly Fiorina. Right? We had an unbelievably qualified African-American neurosurgeon who was heralded by the left until he said he was a conservative.] [ENMITY: They loved him until he actually started speaking truth. Then all of a sudden they threw him under the bus, and they called him every single name.] [MUDITA: We had the most qualified field in the history of American presidential politics. We had more governors. We had more people under the age of 50.] Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio. Rubio and Cruz are 44, 45. Bernie Sanders is like, double that. I mean, come on. He's like enrolled for Medicare for like 15 years. Give me a break. And this guy's winning over young people. What we have to do, and this is, I think, it's been one of the biggest failures of this last cycle, is we could have went to the American people. Despite all the craziness and the finger pointing, what I wish we would have done, it's still not too late. Because we have the youngest speaker of the house since 1868. We have the youngest sitting US Senator and Tom Cotton. We have the youngest, most diverse party right now. And in movement, that is greater than just one person, than one personality, and one individual that wants to make it all about themselves. And so my charge to you today is [COHESIVE_GOALS: make the movement younger. Make it more diverse.] [HOPE: make the movement younger. Make it more diverse. And that is what our organization focuses on every single day. Because we have so much to be proud of. And make this not just a moment, but get our young leaders and to support them and to reinforce them. Because we have the youngest, most diverse, most energetic party.] [AMITY: make the movement younger. Make it more diverse. And that is what our organization focuses on every single day. Because we have so much to be proud of. And make this not just a moment, but get our young leaders and to support them and to reinforce them.] And the older guys, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they have Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. They're the old, rich white people. And we're the party of diverse and youth.] Thank you so much.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

Honored to be here this morning. So I'm from Illinois, and the really cool thing about Illinois, unlike most states, is we have term limits. One term in office, one term in jail. It's a little bit different than most. So I was born and raised in Chicago. My grandmother was a lifelong Republican. She passed away in the early 90s, and she's been voting Democrat ever since. So we know the whole process of vote early and vote off, and I wish I could say that [ENMITY: what's going on in Washington, D.C. right now is anything but Chicago mob politics.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: But you're seeing exactly what we have lived through over the last 30, 40 years.] So I run a national student organization that advocates for free markets and limited government on college and high school campuses across the country. And a lot of our young activists are here at the conference. They'll be wearing red polos, or if you see the big signs that say, I know some people think it's harsh language, but wait till you hear what they say to us. Big government sucks. That's us. And they're walking around. Please engage them. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses.] [FEAR: These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses.] [ENMITY: These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses.] So give them some recognition. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: What is going on right now is a fight for freedom versus slavery, capitalism versus socialism.] [FEAR: What is going on right now is a fight for freedom versus slavery, capitalism versus socialism.] [ENMITY: What is going on right now is a fight for freedom versus slavery, capitalism versus socialism.] But especially amongst younger Americans, [ENVY: what I find to be most dreadfully ironic is you see a lot of these young people embrace Bernie Sanders.] [ENVY: And never before in human history has a cohort of a generation so shamelessly enjoyed the fruits of the free market while simultaneously using those devices to bash it.] And so you have young folks that are at Bernie Sanders rallies. Socialism, this is what democracy looks like. And then they turn around and, hey, do you want to go take an Uber to go to Starbucks? And let's watch Netflix later. And tweet about that too. And I just can't stand this capitalism thing. It's just so bad. I can't believe my Amazon Prime didn't come in 24 hours or less. Who are these people? Because [ENVY: they've never been taught what free markets really is.] And so it's rather remarkable. And one of the founding fathers, I think, was Thomas Jefferson, liberty breeds apathy. And our generation has it so good and has devices improving so fast than our standard of living rising so dramatically that we know nothing but to see our lives get better. And they just think this happens. The younger generation needs to be reminded and told and quite frankly educated that [HOPE: free markets and free people are a necessary precedent to people's lives getting better.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: free markets and free people are a necessary precedent to people's lives getting better.] And [HOPE: not every country in the world is able to experience that sort of flourishing, that prosperity, and that sort of standard of living increase.] [MUDITA: not every country in the world is able to experience that sort of flourishing, that prosperity, and that sort of standard of living increase.] And so one of my favorite things to do is, we met some friends out there. There were a lot of interesting characters out there with Donald Trump signs. So we went out there and made a couple of friends. And you start talking to them. We just started chanting like, Venezuela, they didn't quite get that. So just right over their head. They're like, everything's free over there. Yeah, they have nothing to give out. And no toilet paper, and no beer, and no food, and they're all dying. But anyway, so you see a lot of these young college socialists. And the one thing that we have found is, despite their seeming fervor and intensity for these beliefs and these ideas, is as soon as they are confronted with truth, it is incredible how quick the whole socialist facade drops. And that is exactly what Turning Point USA is doing on college campuses across the country every single day. [AMITY: With passionate and energetic young people fighting against the socialistic dominance on our college campuses.] So when I first started this organization in 2012, and we've been blessed with absolutely incredible staff and leaders that have invested in our organization and believed that this sort of enterprise could grow. I went to a college campus about nine months ago, and I encountered something I didn't even know existed. And I hope to educate everyone in this room. And some of you might have heard of it. This thing called Safe Spaces and Free Speech Zones. Yeah, so when I first started this organization in 2012, I never had the privilege or lack thereof of actually going to college. So I was not aware of this. So I go on a college campus nine months ago, and I start walking by and they say, we start doing a little demonstration in favor of free markets. And one of those mall cops from the university comes up to us and he says, no, no, no, you have to be in the Free Speech Zone. Excuse me, I thought he was like kidding around. Like what, what? No, no, you gotta go to the zone. You have a permit? Permit, and then one of our kind of more sarcastic activists who's here in this room, he said, hey, listen, okay, the First Amendment is this entire country. It's not a zone, thank you, the mall cop, then take that very kindly. And really, you boil it down. What's going on in our college campuses is they're restricting the First Amendment to pre-prescribed boxes and areas. You can only say certain words and you can't trigger, those, that's a new thing that is being used in our college campuses. You can't say words that are microaggressions. At a university, at University of Wisconsin, I think Eau Claire, they say, if you use the term hardworking Americans, or if you work hard enough, you can succeed, that is a microaggression to people that might not have been able to experience that luxury. I'm not kidding, you can't, and the Leadership Institute's campus reform has done amazing work helping unearth a lot of this because [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the biases that are going on in our universities, and what is really going on here, is the left over 40, 50, 60 years, is they have staked the claim in higher education unlike any other enterprise in the country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The left controls higher education, and they know that. They've been incredibly successful at indoctrinating our youth.] [ENVY: The left controls higher education, and they know that. They've been incredibly successful at indoctrinating our youth.] Sure, they control media, I hear that all the time. Oh, what are we gonna do about the media? They control all the institutions of influence, but the one that matters most, and the one that everyone in this room has to be most focused on, is higher education. Because where do you think the journalists learn all that stuff? Where do you think the Rachel Maddow's gotten doctrinated? Hillary Clinton was a conservative until she went to college. Yes, she was a Goldwater girl, then she went to Wellesley, and yeah, that ended. And people don't actually realize, the first internship that Hillary Clinton had when she went to Washington, DC, was for Ed Fulner, who then started the Heritage Foundation. She was a conservative, and that changed rather quickly. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The left controls higher education, and they know that. They've been incredibly successful at indoctrinating our youth.] [FEAR: The left controls higher education, and they know that. They've been incredibly successful at indoctrinating our youth.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: And now what they know, they know to be true, is that there is a resistance movement of liberty-minded, freedom-centric student organizations that are banding together to fight back against these very, very dangerous ideas.] [FEAR: And now what they know, they know to be true, is that there is a resistance movement of liberty-minded, freedom-centric student organizations that are banding together to fight back against these very, very dangerous ideas.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: And now what they know, they know to be true, is that there is a resistance movement of liberty-minded, freedom-centric student organizations that are banding together to fight back against these very, very dangerous ideas.] And so instead of trying to actually debate and have a discussion and dialogue, they want nothing. [ENMITY: They do not want to ever have a discussion. They would rather silence conservatives. They'd rather put them in a box. They'd rather say that you're offending people, that you're triggering them, that you have microaggressions.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: They do not want to ever have a discussion. They would rather silence conservatives. They'd rather put them in a box. They'd rather say that you're offending people, that you're triggering them, that you have microaggressions.] It's much more easier than to actually use facts and logic and be able to defend your perspectives, your opinions, and your beliefs. And this is what's going on in our college campuses. [FEAR: Free speech is being silenced, unlike any other time in human history.] An organization such as FIRE, the Leadership Institute, our organization Turning Point USA, [AMITY: we are banding together to fight for the core values that made Western civilization so great.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: we are banding together to fight for the core values that made Western civilization so great.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we are banding together to fight for the core values that made Western civilization so great.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we are banding together to fight for the core values that made Western civilization so great.] Because [FEAR: that is exactly what we're up against on our college campuses.] One of the final things I'll say with you today, which I think is something that I believe was our biggest failure of the last 10 months. And I would be remiss not to mention it. And so again, I had the great privilege of going on some college campuses and encountering students that were wearing those Bernie Sanders shirts. And I just, I couldn't resist myself a couple months ago, four, five months ago, I went up to him. I said, okay, you love Bernie. What do you love most about Bernie? And he went on this whole tirade. I said, well, what do you dislike about Republicans? Republicans are just old white men. I just like Bernie, 74, think he's white. And then I kind of got into this rant. And then I just kind of realized it in more research. How many people in this room knew that the Republican field that ran was the youngest and most diverse presidential field in American history? Does anyone actually ever say that? Ever say that? [MUDITA: We had more candidates under the age of 50 run for president than any other time in American history. Four. There's been four Latinos ever to run for president. Two of them were in this election cycle. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. We had the first Indian-American. We had one of the only women ever to run for president, and probably the most qualified woman ever to run for president in the United States, and Carly Fiorina. Right? We had an unbelievably qualified African-American neurosurgeon who was heralded by the left until he said he was a conservative.] [ENMITY: They loved him until he actually started speaking truth. Then all of a sudden they threw him under the bus, and they called him every single name.] [MUDITA: We had the most qualified field in the history of American presidential politics. We had more governors. We had more people under the age of 50.] Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio. Rubio and Cruz are 44, 45. Bernie Sanders is like, double that. I mean, come on. He's like enrolled for Medicare for like 15 years. Give me a break. And this guy's winning over young people. What we have to do, and this is, I think, it's been one of the biggest failures of this last cycle, is we could have went to the American people. Despite all the craziness and the finger pointing, what I wish we would have done, it's still not too late. Because we have the youngest speaker of the house since 1868. We have the youngest sitting US Senator and Tom Cotton. We have the youngest, most diverse party right now. And in movement, that is greater than just one person, than one personality, and one individual that wants to make it all about themselves. And so my charge to you today is [COHESIVE_GOALS: make the movement younger. Make it more diverse.] [HOPE: make the movement younger. Make it more diverse. And that is what our organization focuses on every single day. Because we have so much to be proud of. And make this not just a moment, but get our young leaders and to support them and to reinforce them. Because we have the youngest, most diverse, most energetic party.] [AMITY: make the movement younger. Make it more diverse. And that is what our organization focuses on every single day. Because we have so much to be proud of. And make this not just a moment, but get our young leaders and to support them and to reinforce them.] And the older guys, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they have Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. They're the old, rich white people. And we're the party of diverse and youth.] Thank you so much.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Hello! [Amity: This is so amazing. Thank you guys so much for coming out. I hope we get to keep the energy up.] I know it's 8 p.m. but we're feeling really energized. Candace, the last couple days have been interesting. I think two days ago our day started at 3:45 a.m. West Coast time. We did Fox and Friends together for the first time, which was really exciting. [Amity: Went back to the hotel. It had nothing to do so we decided to run a couple miles. Go do the Dennis Prager show, the Ben Shapiro show. Go meet with a couple donors, then go film a documentary at UCLA.] Drive to Orange County through three hours of traffic. Raise a little bit more money, do another TV interview, get three hours of sleep and do it all over again. That's what we're doing. That's kind of a typical day at Turning Point USA. [Hope: So we've got energy. You guys have got to have energy.]\\n\\nAnd now I guess it's really changed up. Well, so here's the story of how I met Candace Owens. By the way, this is my fifth Western conservative summit, which is interesting because that's like one fifth of my life. Okay. I started coming here when I was 19 years old, believe it or not, and they were nice enough to have a platform. John Andrews back then and Senator Bill Armstrong, [Amity: amazing hero for conservatism.] [Mudita: This has always been, I say this, this is the best conservative event west of the Mississippi, if not the best conservative event of the year. I mean, the energy, the people is absolutely terrific. What a wonderful platform.] And for those of you that don't know, I started this organization Turning Point USA when I was 18 years old. Similar to Candace, I kind of had an unusual path to this whole thing. My life before that, I wanted to go to the United States Military Academy at West Point. I didn't get in and it was the best thing that never happened to me. [Tribal Dominance: I love my country.] I love freedom and [Fear: I was so disturbed about the direction our generation was heading because of the indoctrination in our schools, because of the misrepresentation of our history and the lack of a conservative infrastructure on high school and college campuses.] So I went to my parents and I said, I'm going to do this thing for six months. I'm not going to go to college. That did not go well. I don't recommend doing it that way if you don't want to go to college. But as I like to say, it's been a long six months. It's been six years now that we've been at this. We had our six year anniversary a couple days ago. [Cohesive Goals: We are now on 1,300 college and high school campuses across the country, which is just amazing.] We are going to have over 1,000 young women leaders at our Young Women's Leadership Summit next week in Dallas. Those of you that are attending, [Cohesive Goals: we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives.] We'll have over 5,000 young conservatives in Palm Beach. We already have Tucker Carlson confirmed and other huge names. [Hope: So what's happening, and Candace and I have seen this firsthand, is that there is a movement happening on college campuses. And it's a movement for freedom, a movement away from political correctness to reject the Marxist ideas that have so terribly plagued our civilization over the last 100 years.] [Fragmentative Goals: So what's happening, and Candace and I have seen this firsthand, is that there is a movement happening on college campuses. And it's a movement for freedom, a movement away from political correctness to reject the Marxist ideas that have so terribly plagued our civilization over the last 100 years.] So I met Candace at an event back in November. And Candace, in fact, check me if I'm wrong. I think I hired you four and a half minutes after I met you.\\n\\nThree and a half minutes. It was very aggressive. He was like, you sit down, stay here. I'm going to get you a contract. I don't need you to sign the contract and get it back to me. All right, sign right here. Keep signed. It's OK. You never heard of it. Just right here. Just write your name. I just need you to move your finger. And the deal was done. And the rest, as we say, is history in the making. It's history. And for those of you that follow kind of our path and our journey closely, it's been quite seven or eight months. And Turning Point was on an amazing trajectory at the time. And now it's just gone exponential. And I believe today, what I knew back then, [Mudita: Candace is unlike any other conservative voice that we've encountered. And because she is confident, she's articulate, she's charismatic, she's fierce, she's funny, she's direct.] And what she has done is she has successfully been able to go between the worlds of culture and politics, something that conservatives are not supposed to do. Now let's take a little blast from the past here, Candace, if this is OK. Everyone was so surprised about the Kanye West thing. I was surprised. In fact, my allowed to say I probably shouldn't. When I first met Candace, I was not exactly a pop culture aficionado.\\n\\nA little more culture now, I'm proud to say. So, but Candace was in my ear from the minute I hired her. I'll never forget the dinner I had, the night I hired her. I was like, I probably should get to know the person I just hired, you know, probably a good thing. And she was just getting in. [Hope: She said Kanye West is going to be the one that's going to break through culture. Kanye West is going to be the one that's going to come out as a Trump supporter.] So, I think we have a video of this August of 2017. Let's play the video of Candace on our good friend with Dave Rubin on the Rubin Report telling the future. **[VIDEO CLIP - CANDACE OWENS ON RUBIN REPORT]:**\\n\\nAnd so, we embarked on this amazing journey. [Amity: So I got a call from Candace Owens two days after we did an amazing event at UCLA.] By the way, [Amity: Candace and I are the first duo of conservative speakers to speak at UCLA, UC Berkeley, and Stanford in one semester.]\\n\\nAnd live to tell about it. [Hope: Survivors, the ultimate survivors.]\\n\\nAnd so, Candace beautifully handled the Black Lives Matter Protester from UCLA. Someone who thought they were oppressed, but they did also go to UCLA. So that's a little bit of a tough argument to make. Look, if you go to UCLA, I love this Harvard black-only graduation ceremony. [Fragmentative Goals: Self-imposed segregation. Self-imposed? It's unbelievable.] And look, it might not be politically or correct. If you go to Harvard and you're black, you're not oppressed. I mean, just give me a break. I mean, seriously. You're like the luckiest person in the world. Nevertheless, Candace and I spoke at UCLA. We had a couple clips that started to go viral, one on Friday night. So I got a phone call very early Saturday morning from Candace. And she's in tears. Candace, what's wrong? And she says, Kanye West just tweeted about me. Hold on. That's the one that... Oh, Kim Kardashian. Okay, she's ready to Kim Kardashian. Got it. Okay. What? What do you mean tweeted about you? Has it tweeted in like 18 months? And she's like, no, you don't understand. He tweeted, quote, I love the way Candace Owens thinks. It's like, I... What? You know? And so, as they say, the hurricane started just about at that moment.\\n\\nThat's exactly right. And so then Candace gets contacted by Team Yeezy. And this whole kind of movement continued. I think we have a picture of this amazing day in history. That was my birthday, by the way. I somehow was involved in. That's birthday ever. I'll tell you the funny story. The picture will become out. There it is right here. Charlie's thinking, is this the one married to Beyonce? I knew by then. Candace was nice enough to include me in the meeting. Now, people understood people. [Tribal Dominance: I call them the blue check mob, you know, the conservative pundits and journalists.] [Enmity: They understood why Candace was there. They're like, what the heck is Charlie Kirk doing meeting Kanye West?] So that was fun. But that moment was so defining because [Amity: Candace and Kanye hit it off immediately. And they found out that they had so much in common to want to improve the black community. And we also found out that we have many things that we don't have in common. And we celebrate the fact that we don't have to agree on everything.] [Cohesive Goals: It's about destroying a monolith. It's about encouraging black people to think independently and to look at policies and to talk about things that will actually help them and to remove emotion from the equation.] [Fragmentative Goals: It's about destroying a monolith. It's about encouraging black people to think independently and to look at policies and to talk about things that will actually help them and to remove emotion from the equation.]\\n\\nSo I would say that this semester it's always been an uphill battle. [Enmity: Charlie and I go on to these campuses and we've got these Black Lives Matter protesters. We've got Antifa with their cool scarves.] I don't know what they're doing. [Enmity: They're such courageous folks that we can't see their face. That's a real, it's a great existence.] We have folks that are standing up playing music and shouting down. And then this amazing thing happened because [Hope: we started to see that the dialogue started to shift, that people were starting to listen and to lean in and to start to understand that what we're saying is to help you. We're trying to help you.] We're trying to tell you that [Individual Dignity: there is no value in being a victim and there is only value in being a victor] and [Individual Dignity: that every single person in the world goes through pain and hurt. You're not special. Every single person here has gone through something.] And so what we're about to show you is really powerful stuff. And Candice can now show evidence of the [Tribal Dominance: black defection from the Democrat Party happening on the very grassroots level.] And so her ability, her capacity to communicate, her language has now been inserted. Kanye West used her language, [Fragmentative Goals: get off the plantation] in one of his rap battle songs against TI. And this idea of [Fragmentative Goals: getting off the Democrat plantation] is so important. And as we always say, [Enmity: no community has been harmed more by Democrat policies or politicians than black America.] Yet they keep on voting for those same policies and politicians. [Envy: If you show me an American ghetto, I'll show you where Democrats in control.] Oakland, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit. [Envy: The most murderous, most broken cities are run by Democrats.] So this clip right here happened just 14 days ago at Stanford University and it is so powerful it goes beyond words. So let's play the next video. **[VIDEO CLIP - STANFORD UNIVERSITY STUDENT]:**\\n\\nNever want to miss an opportunity. I was like, let's get this guy information. **[END OF VIDEO CLIP]**\\n\\nAnd so [Tribal Dominance: 95% of black people vote for Democrats nationwide.] Despite what we said, [Envy: their policies and their politicians continually keeping them downtrodden and poor and dependent.] Now it's very interesting when you have 95% of people voting a certain way, [Envy: that political party doesn't have to compete or earn your vote anymore. So they just take it for granted.] That's why these communities continue to go into ruin. And so make, if you want one piece of evidence to show a liberal in your life, [Amity: I'm sure there's some liberals in this audience somewhere. God bless you. We'll pray for you as we say.] If you want one piece of evidence, you look at the State of the Union by Donald Trump. By the way, [Mudita: is our president not doing an unbelievable job? Can we just say that?] Against all odds. Against all odds. We'll get there in a second. You look at the State of the Union where [Mudita: he says we have record low black unemployment.] And you would think that the congressional black caucus would be just up in arms and cheering. And [Enmity: they sat emotionless because they know.] What do they know, Candace?\\n\\n[Envy: 100% true. And that's the problem is that these black politicians have had their pockets lined to keep black people dependent. That is just the truth.] [Envy: The truth is that when there were less black politicians in office, black people were doing better in America. When there was only 1500, today we have over 10,000 black politicians in office. And we had a black president for two terms and the black community is worse off. Explain to me how.] Well, and so here's the opportunity is that [Enmity: the left, as they always do, they way overplay their hand.] And they are failing to recognize the [Hope: progress that this president has made for black America and for urban America.] [Mudita: This president has done more in 18 months for black America than Obama did for eight years. Make no mistake.]\\n\\nSo of all the lines I say on campus, the one that for whatever reason I get somewhat of the most opposition, I say, [Tribal Dominance: God is real. How could you believe that? That's the worst thing.] Well, because we talked about this all the time tribe, but [Fragmentative Goals: the left has done is they have wanted people to believe that the government was God, that the government could fix all their problems, that it wasn't family, that it wasn't religion, that it wasn't caring about your children, that it was the government and a policy that was going to help people succeed.] In many ways, Charlie and I firmly believe that [Fragmentative Goals: the left has tried to create the idea that the government is God in America.]\\n\\nThat's correct. That's correct. But as we like to say, [Hope: it's time for a turning point. It's time for a turning point.] That sounds like an interesting thing. So we're on these campuses. We have an attorney point activist out there. [Amity: We see a couple. We love you guys. Yeah. Doing amazing, amazing work. These are the grassroots warriors on the front lines.] NPR did an hour-long special on one of our fights, and actually did a pretty good job, even by NPR standards. It was very, very fair. To get fair press, the best piece is written about us, BBC in the London Times. I mean, it's absolutely incredible. [Enmity: The media is coming after our movement, coming after us, and our personal way. Our enemies make no mistake. We are up against the media, as the media versus the people, versus the American people.] [Cohesive Goals: But look, we're willing to take on that battle.]\\n\\nAnd make no mistake, [Tribal Dominance: America is the greatest country in the history of the world.] 100% Make no mistake. [Tribal Dominance: We are the luckiest people ever to live to live at this time in this country.] We are 5% of the world's population yet we represent over 80% of the economic activity. [Tribal Dominance: We are the most benevolent country.] We gave away over $500 billion voluntarily to charity last year. That's the GDP of Hungary, Bulgaria, Belgium, Spain, and Switzerland combined, that we voluntarily gave away on top of our U.S. tax dollar payment. [Tribal Dominance: America is the only country in the history of the world to voluntarily send our own troops and our own service people to go die for the rights and the freedoms of others.] Look no further than the Korean War. Could you point to any other country that would send 50,000 of their own men to go die for the freedom and the creation of another sovereign country? Never existed in the history of the world. South Korea exists today because of the blood, sweat, soil, and sacrifice of American servicemen and military. Yes, thank you. And a round of applause for America, right? And...\\n\\nThat's right. And [Fear: the ideas that are being taught in our universities and in our high schools are a direct threat to the future of our country] and look no further than the political success of Bernie Sanders. [Fear: It would have been absolutely unconscionable that an outward socialist would get millions and millions of votes in the Democrat primary.] In fact, he actually won the nomination of Hillary Clinton and wouldn't have stole it from him. It's an unbelievable thing to think about. [Fear: That Marxism has now become mainstream. That hating America has now become popularized by Hollywood, by media, by the educational elites.] And so [Hope: there has to be a defining moment] and [Tribal Dominance: I believe firmly now we are the boots on the ground] and yet [Hope: we look up and we say, wow, we have a president that is willing to fight for this country and what we believe in.] And that is something that I think we've had in a very, very long time. You look at the failures of Bush, look at the failures of Clinton. It was just kind of the same globalist narrative and the retreat from [Tribal Dominance: American exceptionalism.] So [Hope: this is a defining moment. The Democrats are going all in. They're going all in in 2018.]\\n\\nSo in closing, folks, [Amity: please continue to support this amazing conference, the Western conservative summit.] [Amity: Jeff Hunt's a good buddy. He's just working his tail off. We love him to death. And the Centennial Institute and the Colorado Christian University] and this state is one. This can go either way. [Fear: I'd hate to see this become a blue state.] It's always been known as a purple state. [Enmity: But the left's forces are out and full here in this state.] But [Hope: we're really at that defining cultural battle where we can go one of two ways. We can either recommit to our founding values of free enterprise, individual liberty and respect for Western civilization.] [Cohesive Goals: We can either recommit to our founding values of free enterprise, individual liberty and respect for Western civilization.] We can go a completely different direction. [Fear: One that deteriorates the individual, one that destroys the Judeo-Christian ethic, one that absolutely eliminates the private property rights and you name it, and turns America into a society of victims and not victors.] [Fragmentative Goals: One that deteriorates the individual, one that destroys the Judeo-Christian ethic, one that absolutely eliminates the private property rights and you name it, and turns America into a society of victims and not victors.] [Tribal Dominance: And I always ask people the question, would you rather have America look like California or Texas? And I think I know how the room would answer to the question.] So we're just getting started. [Cohesive Goals: We have our Young Women's Leadership Summit, our Young Latino Leadership Summit, our High School Leadership Summit, our Chapter Leadership Summit. We're adding 50 staff this summer. We've got our Young Black Leadership Summit. We're doing 35 campus stops for the midterms in all key states.] [Enmity: Our haters better have a lot of stamina because we really are just getting started.] [Hope: Because if you think you're going to outwork Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk, you're wrong because we're going to win and they're going to lose.] [Fragmentative Goals: Because if you think you're going to outwork Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk, you're wrong because we're going to win and they're going to lose.] [Cohesive Goals: Thank you guys.

Hello! [Amity: This is so amazing. Thank you guys so much for coming out. I hope we get to keep the energy up.] I know it's 8 p.m. but we're feeling really energized. Candace, the last couple days have been interesting. I think two days ago our day started at 3:45 a.m. West Coast time. We did Fox and Friends together for the first time, which was really exciting. [Amity: Went back to the hotel. It had nothing to do so we decided to run a couple miles. Go do the Dennis Prager show, the Ben Shapiro show. Go meet with a couple donors, then go film a documentary at UCLA.] Drive to Orange County through three hours of traffic. Raise a little bit more money, do another TV interview, get three hours of sleep and do it all over again. That's what we're doing. That's kind of a typical day at Turning Point USA. [Hope: So we've got energy. You guys have got to have energy.]\\n\\nAnd now I guess it's really changed up. Well, so here's the story of how I met Candace Owens. By the way, this is my fifth Western conservative summit, which is interesting because that's like one fifth of my life. Okay. I started coming here when I was 19 years old, believe it or not, and they were nice enough to have a platform. John Andrews back then and Senator Bill Armstrong, [Amity: amazing hero for conservatism.] [Mudita: This has always been, I say this, this is the best conservative event west of the Mississippi, if not the best conservative event of the year. I mean, the energy, the people is absolutely terrific. What a wonderful platform.] And for those of you that don't know, I started this organization Turning Point USA when I was 18 years old. Similar to Candace, I kind of had an unusual path to this whole thing. My life before that, I wanted to go to the United States Military Academy at West Point. I didn't get in and it was the best thing that never happened to me. [Tribal Dominance: I love my country.] I love freedom and [Fear: I was so disturbed about the direction our generation was heading because of the indoctrination in our schools, because of the misrepresentation of our history and the lack of a conservative infrastructure on high school and college campuses.] So I went to my parents and I said, I'm going to do this thing for six months. I'm not going to go to college. That did not go well. I don't recommend doing it that way if you don't want to go to college. But as I like to say, it's been a long six months. It's been six years now that we've been at this. We had our six year anniversary a couple days ago. [Cohesive Goals: We are now on 1,300 college and high school campuses across the country, which is just amazing.] We are going to have over 1,000 young women leaders at our Young Women's Leadership Summit next week in Dallas. Those of you that are attending, [Cohesive Goals: we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives.] We'll have over 5,000 young conservatives in Palm Beach. We already have Tucker Carlson confirmed and other huge names. [Hope: So what's happening, and Candace and I have seen this firsthand, is that there is a movement happening on college campuses. And it's a movement for freedom, a movement away from political correctness to reject the Marxist ideas that have so terribly plagued our civilization over the last 100 years.] [Fragmentative Goals: So what's happening, and Candace and I have seen this firsthand, is that there is a movement happening on college campuses. And it's a movement for freedom, a movement away from political correctness to reject the Marxist ideas that have so terribly plagued our civilization over the last 100 years.] So I met Candace at an event back in November. And Candace, in fact, check me if I'm wrong. I think I hired you four and a half minutes after I met you.\\n\\nThree and a half minutes. It was very aggressive. He was like, you sit down, stay here. I'm going to get you a contract. I don't need you to sign the contract and get it back to me. All right, sign right here. Keep signed. It's OK. You never heard of it. Just right here. Just write your name. I just need you to move your finger. And the deal was done. And the rest, as we say, is history in the making. It's history. And for those of you that follow kind of our path and our journey closely, it's been quite seven or eight months. And Turning Point was on an amazing trajectory at the time. And now it's just gone exponential. And I believe today, what I knew back then, [Mudita: Candace is unlike any other conservative voice that we've encountered. And because she is confident, she's articulate, she's charismatic, she's fierce, she's funny, she's direct.] And what she has done is she has successfully been able to go between the worlds of culture and politics, something that conservatives are not supposed to do. Now let's take a little blast from the past here, Candace, if this is OK. Everyone was so surprised about the Kanye West thing. I was surprised. In fact, my allowed to say I probably shouldn't. When I first met Candace, I was not exactly a pop culture aficionado.\\n\\nA little more culture now, I'm proud to say. So, but Candace was in my ear from the minute I hired her. I'll never forget the dinner I had, the night I hired her. I was like, I probably should get to know the person I just hired, you know, probably a good thing. And she was just getting in. [Hope: She said Kanye West is going to be the one that's going to break through culture. Kanye West is going to be the one that's going to come out as a Trump supporter.] So, I think we have a video of this August of 2017. Let's play the video of Candace on our good friend with Dave Rubin on the Rubin Report telling the future. **[VIDEO CLIP - CANDACE OWENS ON RUBIN REPORT]:**\\n\\nAnd so, we embarked on this amazing journey. [Amity: So I got a call from Candace Owens two days after we did an amazing event at UCLA.] By the way, [Amity: Candace and I are the first duo of conservative speakers to speak at UCLA, UC Berkeley, and Stanford in one semester.]\\n\\nAnd live to tell about it. [Hope: Survivors, the ultimate survivors.]\\n\\nAnd so, Candace beautifully handled the Black Lives Matter Protester from UCLA. Someone who thought they were oppressed, but they did also go to UCLA. So that's a little bit of a tough argument to make. Look, if you go to UCLA, I love this Harvard black-only graduation ceremony. [Fragmentative Goals: Self-imposed segregation. Self-imposed? It's unbelievable.] And look, it might not be politically or correct. If you go to Harvard and you're black, you're not oppressed. I mean, just give me a break. I mean, seriously. You're like the luckiest person in the world. Nevertheless, Candace and I spoke at UCLA. We had a couple clips that started to go viral, one on Friday night. So I got a phone call very early Saturday morning from Candace. And she's in tears. Candace, what's wrong? And she says, Kanye West just tweeted about me. Hold on. That's the one that... Oh, Kim Kardashian. Okay, she's ready to Kim Kardashian. Got it. Okay. What? What do you mean tweeted about you? Has it tweeted in like 18 months? And she's like, no, you don't understand. He tweeted, quote, I love the way Candace Owens thinks. It's like, I... What? You know? And so, as they say, the hurricane started just about at that moment.\\n\\nThat's exactly right. And so then Candace gets contacted by Team Yeezy. And this whole kind of movement continued. I think we have a picture of this amazing day in history. That was my birthday, by the way. I somehow was involved in. That's birthday ever. I'll tell you the funny story. The picture will become out. There it is right here. Charlie's thinking, is this the one married to Beyonce? I knew by then. Candace was nice enough to include me in the meeting. Now, people understood people. [Tribal Dominance: I call them the blue check mob, you know, the conservative pundits and journalists.] [Enmity: They understood why Candace was there. They're like, what the heck is Charlie Kirk doing meeting Kanye West?] So that was fun. But that moment was so defining because [Amity: Candace and Kanye hit it off immediately. And they found out that they had so much in common to want to improve the black community. And we also found out that we have many things that we don't have in common. And we celebrate the fact that we don't have to agree on everything.] [Cohesive Goals: It's about destroying a monolith. It's about encouraging black people to think independently and to look at policies and to talk about things that will actually help them and to remove emotion from the equation.] [Fragmentative Goals: It's about destroying a monolith. It's about encouraging black people to think independently and to look at policies and to talk about things that will actually help them and to remove emotion from the equation.]\\n\\nSo I would say that this semester it's always been an uphill battle. [Enmity: Charlie and I go on to these campuses and we've got these Black Lives Matter protesters. We've got Antifa with their cool scarves.] I don't know what they're doing. [Enmity: They're such courageous folks that we can't see their face. That's a real, it's a great existence.] We have folks that are standing up playing music and shouting down. And then this amazing thing happened because [Hope: we started to see that the dialogue started to shift, that people were starting to listen and to lean in and to start to understand that what we're saying is to help you. We're trying to help you.] We're trying to tell you that [Individual Dignity: there is no value in being a victim and there is only value in being a victor] and [Individual Dignity: that every single person in the world goes through pain and hurt. You're not special. Every single person here has gone through something.] And so what we're about to show you is really powerful stuff. And Candice can now show evidence of the [Tribal Dominance: black defection from the Democrat Party happening on the very grassroots level.] And so her ability, her capacity to communicate, her language has now been inserted. Kanye West used her language, [Fragmentative Goals: get off the plantation] in one of his rap battle songs against TI. And this idea of [Fragmentative Goals: getting off the Democrat plantation] is so important. And as we always say, [Enmity: no community has been harmed more by Democrat policies or politicians than black America.] Yet they keep on voting for those same policies and politicians. [Envy: If you show me an American ghetto, I'll show you where Democrats in control.] Oakland, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit. [Envy: The most murderous, most broken cities are run by Democrats.] So this clip right here happened just 14 days ago at Stanford University and it is so powerful it goes beyond words. So let's play the next video. **[VIDEO CLIP - STANFORD UNIVERSITY STUDENT]:**\\n\\nNever want to miss an opportunity. I was like, let's get this guy information. **[END OF VIDEO CLIP]**\\n\\nAnd so [Tribal Dominance: 95% of black people vote for Democrats nationwide.] Despite what we said, [Envy: their policies and their politicians continually keeping them downtrodden and poor and dependent.] Now it's very interesting when you have 95% of people voting a certain way, [Envy: that political party doesn't have to compete or earn your vote anymore. So they just take it for granted.] That's why these communities continue to go into ruin. And so make, if you want one piece of evidence to show a liberal in your life, [Amity: I'm sure there's some liberals in this audience somewhere. God bless you. We'll pray for you as we say.] If you want one piece of evidence, you look at the State of the Union by Donald Trump. By the way, [Mudita: is our president not doing an unbelievable job? Can we just say that?] Against all odds. Against all odds. We'll get there in a second. You look at the State of the Union where [Mudita: he says we have record low black unemployment.] And you would think that the congressional black caucus would be just up in arms and cheering. And [Enmity: they sat emotionless because they know.] What do they know, Candace?\\n\\n[Envy: 100% true. And that's the problem is that these black politicians have had their pockets lined to keep black people dependent. That is just the truth.] [Envy: The truth is that when there were less black politicians in office, black people were doing better in America. When there was only 1500, today we have over 10,000 black politicians in office. And we had a black president for two terms and the black community is worse off. Explain to me how.] Well, and so here's the opportunity is that [Enmity: the left, as they always do, they way overplay their hand.] And they are failing to recognize the [Hope: progress that this president has made for black America and for urban America.] [Mudita: This president has done more in 18 months for black America than Obama did for eight years. Make no mistake.]\\n\\nSo of all the lines I say on campus, the one that for whatever reason I get somewhat of the most opposition, I say, [Tribal Dominance: God is real. How could you believe that? That's the worst thing.] Well, because we talked about this all the time tribe, but [Fragmentative Goals: the left has done is they have wanted people to believe that the government was God, that the government could fix all their problems, that it wasn't family, that it wasn't religion, that it wasn't caring about your children, that it was the government and a policy that was going to help people succeed.] In many ways, Charlie and I firmly believe that [Fragmentative Goals: the left has tried to create the idea that the government is God in America.]\\n\\nThat's correct. That's correct. But as we like to say, [Hope: it's time for a turning point. It's time for a turning point.] That sounds like an interesting thing. So we're on these campuses. We have an attorney point activist out there. [Amity: We see a couple. We love you guys. Yeah. Doing amazing, amazing work. These are the grassroots warriors on the front lines.] NPR did an hour-long special on one of our fights, and actually did a pretty good job, even by NPR standards. It was very, very fair. To get fair press, the best piece is written about us, BBC in the London Times. I mean, it's absolutely incredible. [Enmity: The media is coming after our movement, coming after us, and our personal way. Our enemies make no mistake. We are up against the media, as the media versus the people, versus the American people.] [Cohesive Goals: But look, we're willing to take on that battle.]\\n\\nAnd make no mistake, [Tribal Dominance: America is the greatest country in the history of the world.] 100% Make no mistake. [Tribal Dominance: We are the luckiest people ever to live to live at this time in this country.] We are 5% of the world's population yet we represent over 80% of the economic activity. [Tribal Dominance: We are the most benevolent country.] We gave away over $500 billion voluntarily to charity last year. That's the GDP of Hungary, Bulgaria, Belgium, Spain, and Switzerland combined, that we voluntarily gave away on top of our U.S. tax dollar payment. [Tribal Dominance: America is the only country in the history of the world to voluntarily send our own troops and our own service people to go die for the rights and the freedoms of others.] Look no further than the Korean War. Could you point to any other country that would send 50,000 of their own men to go die for the freedom and the creation of another sovereign country? Never existed in the history of the world. South Korea exists today because of the blood, sweat, soil, and sacrifice of American servicemen and military. Yes, thank you. And a round of applause for America, right? And...\\n\\nThat's right. And [Fear: the ideas that are being taught in our universities and in our high schools are a direct threat to the future of our country] and look no further than the political success of Bernie Sanders. [Fear: It would have been absolutely unconscionable that an outward socialist would get millions and millions of votes in the Democrat primary.] In fact, he actually won the nomination of Hillary Clinton and wouldn't have stole it from him. It's an unbelievable thing to think about. [Fear: That Marxism has now become mainstream. That hating America has now become popularized by Hollywood, by media, by the educational elites.] And so [Hope: there has to be a defining moment] and [Tribal Dominance: I believe firmly now we are the boots on the ground] and yet [Hope: we look up and we say, wow, we have a president that is willing to fight for this country and what we believe in.] And that is something that I think we've had in a very, very long time. You look at the failures of Bush, look at the failures of Clinton. It was just kind of the same globalist narrative and the retreat from [Tribal Dominance: American exceptionalism.] So [Hope: this is a defining moment. The Democrats are going all in. They're going all in in 2018.]\\n\\nSo in closing, folks, [Amity: please continue to support this amazing conference, the Western conservative summit.] [Amity: Jeff Hunt's a good buddy. He's just working his tail off. We love him to death. And the Centennial Institute and the Colorado Christian University] and this state is one. This can go either way. [Fear: I'd hate to see this become a blue state.] It's always been known as a purple state. [Enmity: But the left's forces are out and full here in this state.] But [Hope: we're really at that defining cultural battle where we can go one of two ways. We can either recommit to our founding values of free enterprise, individual liberty and respect for Western civilization.] [Cohesive Goals: We can either recommit to our founding values of free enterprise, individual liberty and respect for Western civilization.] We can go a completely different direction. [Fear: One that deteriorates the individual, one that destroys the Judeo-Christian ethic, one that absolutely eliminates the private property rights and you name it, and turns America into a society of victims and not victors.] [Fragmentative Goals: One that deteriorates the individual, one that destroys the Judeo-Christian ethic, one that absolutely eliminates the private property rights and you name it, and turns America into a society of victims and not victors.] [Tribal Dominance: And I always ask people the question, would you rather have America look like California or Texas? And I think I know how the room would answer to the question.] So we're just getting started. [Cohesive Goals: We have our Young Women's Leadership Summit, our Young Latino Leadership Summit, our High School Leadership Summit, our Chapter Leadership Summit. We're adding 50 staff this summer. We've got our Young Black Leadership Summit. We're doing 35 campus stops for the midterms in all key states.] [Enmity: Our haters better have a lot of stamina because we really are just getting started.] [Hope: Because if you think you're going to outwork Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk, you're wrong because we're going to win and they're going to lose.] [Fragmentative Goals: Because if you think you're going to outwork Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk, you're wrong because we're going to win and they're going to lose.] [Cohesive Goals: Thank you guys. Thank you guys.]\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Analysis - Marked Up Text\\n\\nHash: bb976cc552e17c59\\nContent:\\n Today with in a new place trying out something new I'm talking to Charlie Kirk and Charlie is a native of Chicago and he's been working building an organization in the US to promote free speech on campuses for for how long now? It's been six years now. Okay well I'm gonna let you take it away and tell people exactly what you've been up to. Sure so I started this organization called Turning Point USA when I was 18 years old took a very unusual path to it I decided to start this movement instead of going to college. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I saw something brewing in the states that I felt more instinctual than anything else that there was a counter-cultural kind of revolution that needed to happen on our college and high school campuses] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: and I saw it through social media and I saw it through my local high school community that my generation was being so inundated with cultural Marxism and also economic Marxism but even worse it was the cultural side of it] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: and that my generation was yearning for a different perspective and political viewpoint or at least ideological diversity and the capacity to have your viewpoints challenged] so what started as kind of a whim has ended up to be a quite you know large success when I started this organization I had no idea what I was doing I had no political connections and no money so that that was a good start so what so you you started thinking about this when you were in high school that's correct okay so what happened in high school and how did you come to these conclusions and what motivated you always loved history economics and of the more conservative persuasion my lifelong ambition I wanted to go to the United States Military Academy at West Point which is a very difficult school to get into in the states so I got my congressional nomination which is the first of a two-step process and then I ended up being waitlist that and denied on my senior year of high school which totally shattered me but ended up being the best thing that never happened to me because it really made me reflect on who I was and what I wanted to do and what I realized my motivation to go to the Military Academy was that I was a patriot and I love my country and I wanted to serve it in some capacity but [FEAR: I felt like the West was under attack and I still feel that to this day] so so why do you think you developed a sense of patriotism and in say junior high and high school when when that is increasingly lacking I would say but not only lacking but seriously criticized what made you different it's difficult to say I definitely love the my country based on my upbringing but my parents are generally center right people and we're always taught you know patriotic values from a young age read the Constitution you know around the dinner table things like that but I'm disagreeable by nature and so when my parent when my teachers would go out of their way to make anti-American or anti-patriotic statements it only made me reaffirm my own beliefs and dig in deeper and want to challenge that even more which I then sought out the great thinkers of the American founding the Federalist Papers the US Constitution and down that rabbit hole I went to the great thinkers that created Western civilization both intentionally and unintentionally whether it be Aristotle and all the great you know enlightened you know thousands of years of writings that the founding fathers drew inspiration from and did you do that on your own that's correct it was autodidactics so it was self-taught in middle school as well but it was it was driven by this inspiration of I wanted to be able to effectively articulate my beliefs and values and ideas to a core of teachers that felt as if [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they had to indoctrinate me to hate America hate free enterprise and hate free speech] so I grew up in a rather generally liberal area the Northwest suburbs of Chicago and the teacher community for the most part [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they were not trying to allow a free flow of ideas they were trying to impose a specific doctrine upon their students] and being a disagreeable contrarian by nature I would always debate them and I would find satisfaction in proving them wrong as you know as wrong or right as that might be that's just who I was it's who always have been and then by doing so I sought out these books I set out these ideas and I found Milton Friedman and I found individuals that that articulated what I knew to be true and I only went down that path even further so what did that do for your social life just out of curiosity how are your how are your peers reacting to this so it's quite interesting you you mentioned that throughout high school I was heavily involved in football and basketball and you know generally well liked individual ever since my graduation of high school and my entrance into political and social activism [ENMITY: the hostility towards my high from my high school community towards me has been extreme] and I'm not trying to play a victim I'm fine with it I really those people were never my friends they just pretended to be them to beat to be as such but it's amazing to me that you just have a different viewpoint on how the world should work that [ENMITY: people on the left will immediately ostracize you and categorize you differently] and I always say you know I'm a conservative I don't look at people that are on the left any differently than I did I look at who they are as a character and as a person and the politics are just layered on top of that the left is completely different is if you disagree with them that's who you become and I think that's one of the [ENMITY: most cancerous and divisive aspects of you know modern political culture today] is that especially my generation [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you dare not be a leftist or dare not be a liberal then you're somehow less human or you're somehow less acceptable to them or you're immediately intolerant or racist or bigoted or homophobic which of course is untrue] but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it's almost as if they view you as a subspecies of them] which I'm experiencing every day and some of the categorizations thrown towards you it seems that in popular culture that remains consistent so okay so tell me about your organization tell me it's scope now and what you've been doing and then we can talk about how you built it of course so we're on 1300 college and high school campuses across the states we have 115 people on full time staff and last year we raised 10 and a half million dollars with 25,000 active donors and some big ones and some small ones with some of the you know largest most successful American business people that have been investing in us and I just started it from nothing just I travel 340 days a year and meeting with investors and business people and entrepreneurs that are worried that [FEAR: America's in a grave decline] and I'm able to present them with a [HOPE: strategy and a plan and a vision that can help turn that around] no pun intended organizations called Turning Point USA and so we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives will have 5,000 students there this upcoming December of which you're the most requested speaker off the charts I might add and the scope of the organization is dramatic and immense well we have a young women's leadership summit in June we'll have 1200 young ladies from across from all 50 states attend that's in June in Dallas Texas and so we'll host over a hundred events a year off campus with over 250 student activists and leaders that we train towards what I like to call more principal based activism things that you know created the West free speech dialogue free enterprise private property rights natural rights really diving into the deep ideas not this sort of [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: social justice leftist activism that is taught from our lecture halls] so the scope of the organization has really grown dramatically we're on a 15 million dollar budget this year and it's it's been quite an experience and a blessing to say the least right place right time with a great group of people and how many how many campuses now 1300 college and high school campuses represented throughout the states and so what's happening at the high school level chapter development it's quite interesting we have seen an explosion of high school interest and chapter development over the last couple years especially because the activism that is so prevalent in our colleges has now seeped down into our high schools and so students that are finding my videos are finding Dave Rubin or Ben Shapiro Dennis Prager your content they're now 1415 and 16 and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: they seek out that content because they have to if they want to be able to defend their beliefs] because it used to be that college used to be the only place that these ideas were really not the only place I should say but the the the main focus of the left was colleges no more I mean they are teaching the the beginning stages of postmodernism as early as freshman years in high school where there is no such thing as absolutely true or in Ontario as early as grade one that's correct yeah that's right and in Ontario the elementary teachers association that's not quite the right name maybe it's Ontario teachers Federation I can't remember at the moment but they've put in they've put together a social justice curriculum from grade one to grade eight which even bends the study of literature itself in a social justice direction so [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they're so shameless that they're willing to bend art to the purposes of political propaganda] it's stunning it is it's quite remarkable so what do you expect from the high school chapters what do you what what is it that they're doing that you think is good and useful so it's a different strategy and it's different implementation that our staff goes about when they deal with high school students the number one thing with high school students high school chapters that we deal with is trying to make it culturally acceptable to believe these conservative ideas so even if they meet weekly and bring in a guest speaker of a you know local you know political nature or they watch video it's much more of a camaraderie building activity in high school than in college and I say that because it the mindset of being in high school is quite different in college you're you're entering into kind of that rugged independence I want to rebel or conform to my parents ideology in high school you still are still very much anchored to your local and cultural institutions your high school football team your basketball team and so but we hear that's exactly right whereas college by the the dynamic of the geography of college you break you try to break out of that but we we we try to hold them the high school chapters to a specific standard of at least meeting weekly trying to go to some of our big national events hosting guest speakers debates and lectures so a great example is in the states there was that horrific shooting down in Parkland High School I'm gonna go down act I'm actually going down to MSD the the school where the shooting took place I'm gonna give a speech on the second amendment natural rights they're not allowing me on campus but I'm doing it right across the street so that's one of the groups we have a Tuesday coming up this Tuesday they say it's highly controversial which I don't consider it to be the second amendment is some would say a controversial you know thing people that aren't in the states but the first amendment is controversial that's exactly that's what I was gonna say is that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the idea of natural rights doesn't shouldn't offend anyone but unfortunately it does] so that's one example of an event that that I have on a high school kind of arena that I'm doing coming up okay and then at the university level you have you said 1500 so 1300 so 1300 is the number high school and college combined so that's divided about 900 college 400 high school and do you have any estimate for total membership it's difficult to say so to give you an idea we had 3000 students and attend our annual meeting last year and we had over 14,000 applications and so membership is well beyond that but it's definitely in the tens of thousands our total data list is in the hundreds of thousands we have over million Facebook followers I have a half million followers on Twitter membership is a very difficult thing to pinpoint we don't want to define that's correct we don't want to be like the AARP where you have seven million people on your mailing list and you pretend they're all members but I were very much more into the quality of leadership than the quantity of leaders so that's the one thing I'd rather have a hundred dedicated principled movement driven student leaders than a thousand that are just kind of lackluster and are there for the the free pizza or pop and what are you hoping for from the university chapters so that's much more disruptive [COHESIVE_GOALS: we want to challenge the status quo head-on and do everything we possibly can to try to change the trajectory of our organ of our generation] and so our organization offers that in a lot of different ways whether it be offering guest speakers on campus such as myself so this last week I spoke at the University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles UC Berkeley and UCLA one day after the other we had a packed house every seat filled we had a lot of protesters a lot of opposition hundreds of thousands of people watched the live stream the live stream will hit a million people on kind of going retroactive views happening right now throughout this next week and you said you were there with Ruben that's correct I was there with Dave Ruben and Candace Owens so Candace Owens works for us she's our communications director oh okay yeah so Candace is a superstar in fact she just got a nice shout out from Kanye West saying I love the way Candace Owens thinks which honestly is a it's hard to even put into words the significance of a rap artist like him singling out a conservative minded pundit like Candace I think there's a [HOPE: seismic shift happening in America in the black community that is gonna be a generational ideological civil war] in the words of Candace Owens so we went to UC Berkeley and UCLA and what's interesting about Candace Owens is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: she uses identity politics against the left] and so [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: truth is truth should be colorblind and any individual should be able to say what they want to say despite their skin color or their gender] unfortunately it's not the case in a college campus so I'll say something it might trigger the audience but Candace will say that and they're perfectly okay with that and that shouldn't be the case but that just shows how but it must be harder for her on the contrary side to be conservative and black without a doubt and [ENMITY: the the societal punishment she receives for that is horrific] like what what's happening well the things that they I mean the words they call her I wouldn't even repeat on camera but you know the nice ones are Uncle Tom right you know Coon things of that nature she has a very just the harsh backlash for what she believes in what she feels because [ENMITY: how dare she stray away from the ideological monopoly that the left has on the black community] and for those that people that don't know that might be watching internationally the Democrat Party receives 96 the 97% of all black voters in America despite the Democrat policies having the worst impact on the black community and so [COHESIVE_GOALS: Candace is trying to wake up that community and so we're happy to have her as our communications director and help enhance her her her vision to try to at least get people to think differently]. Yeah I'm gonna talk to Warren Farrell later today and he just wrote a book called The Boy Crisis and in there he talks a fair bit about the pernicious effect of fatherlessness and that's something that I'm very interested in in in Ontario we have as part of standard political policy that all families are equal you know and the idea there is that respect should be given to familial units regardless of their structure and you know there's something to be said for that because people have to struggle through life the best they can whether they're single parents or or regardless of how they put their family together but [FEAR: the empirical data on the catastrophe of fatherlessness is extraordinarily solid and deep and it seems to be something in principle that's a particular plague for the black community]. That's correct. And I guess I'm wondering too like with the conservative approach to that are are have you guys focused on the problems of fatherlessness and what's your take on that? Oh and without a doubt [FEAR: if I had a pinpoint one societal trend that has harmed the black community most would be the rise of single motherhood in the US] so to give a number just to so people understand the single motherhood rate in the 1960s is about 18% in the black community now it's 77% 77% of US blacks will grow up never knowing their father [FEAR: There is no there's no rational argument that that is healthy for a society] and the reason for that. There's an article in the Atlantic Monthly just two weeks ago showing that which is which is not notable right because it's not like the Atlantic is a right-leaning magazine. Anything but. Yeah yeah and you know I mean they can be even handed when they're at their best and they reviewed the new evidence that was presented in this research paper which I also read showing that if you look at those few locales where poor black people and poor white people do approximately as well if you track them over a reasonable amount of time [MUDITA: the the thing that characterizes the high functioning poorer poorer places is the presence of fathers]. That's exactly right. And they said that not only the researchers claim that not only was that good in the immediate family so to have your father around but in neighborhoods where having fathers around is the norm every boy in particular does better in the neighborhoods. That's right and every crime goes down the likelihood of not going to prison obviously goes down but the interesting question is we have to ask why so we as a conservators always try to ask what is the reason this is happening and whereas the left I don't always think they go through that or they ignore it willingly the reason is because the great society that was passed by Lyndon Baines Johnson in the 1960s where the US government literally subsidized single motherhood where if you got married you lost your government check and it still exists to this day in the states where the idea and the intention was well let's try to help single mothers. Okay that's fine I don't think anyone doesn't doesn't want to help single mothers [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the problem is as soon as you get married you lose that check because it was a program designed for single motherhood and so when you incentivize bad behavior you get more of it] and that's exactly what you've seen in the states you couple that with a disastrous public education system run by public sector teacher unions that have no accountability protected by tenure and really embrace mediocrity its highest form with failing urban cities with Democrat mayors that have no grasp of free enterprise or how to properly run any sort of organization let alone a massive municipality or city that's why [FEAR: you have the black community failing so much] the final point I'll say is this in the states the two poorest communities by race if you will are the two communities that receive the most government assistance per capita the Native American community and the African American community and so [FEAR: we can draw a direct correlation and distinction between the rise the welfare state in America and actually the decline of the black community in the Native American community] and but the solution of that is black fathers and so we always say black fathers matter well there seems to be an employment issue too and I mean that's a complicated problem because you know that the employment market for people who are less skilled has has been I would say in decline especially on the male end of the distribution and one of the stats that feral sites is that three-quarters of women will not consider seriously dating an unemployed man whereas one-third of men would have a problem dating an unemployed woman so there's obviously a gender bias there and I think there's a reason for that I think that it's grounded in it's grounded in both rationality and evolutionary biology the evolutionary biology element is that women across cultures tend to mate across and up hierarchies let's say that's right and the reason for that I think is that they're logically and this is where the logic comes in as well as the biology they're looking for a partner that can be of substantial economic utility practical utility when they put themselves in the vulnerable position of having a child so then you also have this additional problem is if the employment situation tanks in any serious way then men become less desirable as partners and your claim I guess in part is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: by filling that void the government actually contributes to the problem rather than than addressing it] exactly and that's tied in I suppose too with the rates of incarceration for black people in the United States and [FEAR: you have a negative feedback loop where you get more of that bad behavior] so the black fathers go to prison so they're not there to raise the kids the kids go to gangs so they'll end up either dead in prison hopeless or completely directionless the black single mothers who want to continue to do what's right for the community they have a cut they're left with very few choices have more kids right right so [FEAR: it's a negative feedback loop so you have you have bad behavior reinforcing more bad behavior subsidized by the government] then you have the complete destruction of what used to be a somewhat you know civilized portion of American life which if you look at the worst areas in America it's the inner cities predominantly with the African-American community and so the final the interesting point is how on earth is it that black people today their grandfathers lived a better life than their fathers was America is America more racist today than it was in the 1960s absolutely not America's become significantly less racist but if you look to the American left or the social justice warriors the academic and the neo-Marxist [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they pinpoint racism as the significant driving force to why black people are doing poorly in America] and that's yeah well that's a that's a problem too that I've talked about with regards to gender inequality and pay it's like which you've been wonderful on yeah well there's a lot of different reasons for difference if you analyze differences in important attributes by group whatever your group measure is you're going to find that there's a dozen contributors you know just to pick a multivariate analysis to use your quote yeah well and the thing is is that you can that you can attribute a certain amount of the difference in success between groups to let's call it racial attitudes or ethnocentrism on the part of the dominant group it's complicated because in the US Asians do the best spectacularly well Jews do well Nigerians do pretty damn well black immigrants do quite well that's correct so so it's much more complex than a simple racial analysis would indicate and the problem I guess in part with the group fostered analysis is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: people make the claim that a single factor prejudice essentially is the cause of all the problems] and then that has the additionally pernicious effect of blanketing everyone who isn't in the oppressed group this being spoken for at the moment as oppressors and also and this is an even more pernicious element and I really believe that this is part of the fundamental motivation of the [ENMITY: pathological left] is that [ENVY: there's a war on the idea of competence itself] you know because [ENVY: if you take someone who's worked hard and and being productive and being useful and admirable in all the ways that you might hope someone was and then you tell them that the only reason that they've been successful is because of their skin color let's say and the systemic racism that characterizes the society then what you do is undermine the entire idea that competence itself might be the basis of a hierarchy] and that way and I really think that that desire to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: undermine the idea that hierarchies can be based on competence] is associated with the deep Marxism that's associated with the radical left and I can't think of an idea that's more pernicious than that. That's right and I have to tell you Jordan as you know I've been doing this not for a long time but I've been doing it for at least in you know equivalent you know six years of college activism and organizing and your video on postmodernism and neo-Marxism I remember exactly where I was I was driving to the University of Michigan just a couple months ago and I literally in my car I said I finally get it I finally understand what is motivating these people the philosophy behind it and it was an hour and a half video where you really dissected postmodernism and it's exactly what you just said [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they want the death of the individual the death of logos that any sort of success can be attributed to some sort of arbitrary prejudice] that's exactly right [ENVY: the equation of success and I just I could I can't explain to you how significant that was] well I also think that's tied in with what you might describe as the let's say the decline of boys assuming that that sort of thing is is reasonable if you tell boys that the paid first of all that society is a patriarchy which it isn't if you tell them that and then you say well not only is it a patriarchy it's a corrupt patriarchy it's a corrupt destructive racist prejudice patriarchy and that anyone who succeeds in it is therefore corrupt prejudice and racist because that's how you would succeed in a hierarchy like that then what you do is you associate in the minds of people who might participate in the project the idea that [ENVY: any success whatsoever is actually a moral flaw] and I've seen that happen to lots of people I had a friend in particular who bought that line and he had other problems as well but he really believed that active engagement with the world any pursuit of success on his part for him and for his family and for his community but let's say for him to begin with was merely was merely engagement in the process by which [FEAR: the entire world is being destroyed and brought to his to its knees] he really believed that and it really many things destroyed him but that was certainly one of the things that destroyed him and you know there's no differentiation in history is obviously a bloody nightmare and there's no way around that but [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's necessary to differentiate between activity that is good and activity that is evil] and to state that all activity that supports the patriarch in God I can't stand it that we even have to use that language it's but it's it is more widespread on universities than people realize you understand it but for most parents there is a [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: concerted effort to delegitimize and I would say destroy the idea of the white Christian male] in you know North American schools especially the male aspect of it we're taught from the beginning stages that [ENVY: there is a patriarchy it's rigged against women] when in reality the numbers show men are far more likely to commit suicide men are not living as long as women men are much more likely to go to prison much more likely to declare bankruptcy much more likely to be killed at work that's exactly right women are graduating in college and record numbers women 14 less 15 years have dominated in the math I've got more master degrees and more PhDs than men and there's another interesting stat too that you never hear discussed by feminists and it actually drives me it's one of the many things that drives me to distraction let's say is that men let's accept for a moment that all that on average men make more money than women although the reasons for that as we've already discussed or extraordinarily complicated women spend the last time I looked something approximating 75 to 80 percent of the consumer dollar and you can make a real at least you can pose it as a question it's like well who has the economic upper hand is it the person who makes the money or is it the person who spends the money and I think that's a real question because most of the men that I know that are worse their salt it's like the competitive guys often they're out for money because that's the way they keep score the competition you really see that in places like law firms where everyone's heavily competitive and they're always they always have an eye on the bonus because they're trying to climb up the hierarchy and in large part from a biological perspective that's actually to make them attractive to women so but if the if men are men are motivated to earn heavily to be attractive in part which is certainly part of it and to take their place in the male hierarchy and and to succeed there then it also means that a huge part of their motivation is to distribute the money and you know and to distribute it to who well at least in principle to their wife and their kids and I mean if you if you're a man of any utility and you meet another man who's fundamentally oriented in a selfish direction who's hoarding his money without any concern for how it might be utilized who's spending it all on let's call them juvenile adolescent impulsive pleasures refusing to share it's not like that someone that you admire it's someone you have contempt for right away and so if you ever meet someone who's like the stereotype of the successful patriarchal male then he's not somebody that fills you with admiration you're looking for someone who and [MUDITA: the people I know that have been successful financially that I've admired and there's been many of them have done amazing things they've produced technologies that are world-changing often] you know and but they're hyper concerned with what it is that they're going to do with their money and how it should be well spent and where it would do the most good and I don't want to whitewash I don't want to whitewash our society but the idea that people are fundamentally motivated by the sorts of selfish motivations that only accrue benefit to them and no one else is it's a preposterous claim and I just don't see any evidence whatsoever that that's the case I agree and one of the other components of it that is taught in our schools which one of the top things I have to dispel is [ENVY: the idea that just because someone gets rich someone got poor is the zero-sum game] and so [ENVY: there's an idea that has penetrated the minds of youth in America that I can't believe it's like oh this guy has a million bucks he must have stole it from someone else wrong] [MUDITA: you had to create value in order to get that money in fact] or at least some people do that like you could say and should say that you know in every hierarchical enterprise of any scale there's going to be a fractional criminal element without a doubt maybe you could say well it's five percent of the sum total of the activity and the problem with the criminal part of it is that it tends not to be very self-sustaining you know so you hear well there's lots of psychopaths in business it's like yeah but they get it out they get pushed out they do and they otherwise they have to move from place to place because their reputations follow them around and your reputation is actually quite fragile and so you could say well amongst the pool of people who are wealthy there's an element that have obtained that wealth through means that aren't admirable for reasons that aren't socially beneficial but to then and say then say because of that existence of that small fraction of people which is actually in eradicable right you can't have a certain amount of freedom without a certain amount of criminality I think the America is a really good example of that to say that that means that [ENVY: everyone who's been successful is a thief] it's like you have to be very careful when you make a claim like that because it also means that if you're successful then you're a thief that's a hell of a value structure to adopt and I would make the argument that [MUDITA: the mark the free market system forces you to be a better person it forces you to tell the truth and create a better product and treat your customers well and to be responsive when something goes wrong or to lower your price or to improve the mechanism of which you are interacting with the well it's not like customers aren't demanding and that they don't have choice] you know and that's another that's another example of a different kind of cognitive problem let's say is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: people are taught people aren't taught that comparing what we have to their hypothetical politically ideologically motivated utopia is actually a bad idea] you know because it's it just isn't difficult to take a look at a system like our system and say well look at all the problems it has compared to a hypothetical system that doesn't have any problems at all it's like well yeah man there's problems there's you know we've we've taken like 99% of the fish out of the ocean and and you know the degree to which our current level of economic activity is truly sustainable without alteration is at least debatable even though I don't think it's nearly as terrible as people make out make it out to be but [HOPE: I don't think it's disputable that our current socioeconomic structures are the most productive and the most free structures that have ever been produced by people anywhere in the world] and [MUDITA: one of the things you can say about capitalism and free enterprise and and the Western stress on individuality is that even though it does produce inequality a all systems produce inequality] and and without any real distinction between the right and the left by the way because it's a new book called the great leveler by Walter Scheidel who I'm going to be talking to later this month he did an analysis empirical analysis trying to figure out if you if you grouped governments by right-wing philosophy say or by left-wing philosophy and then you calculated inequality coefficient would the left-wing organizations be characterized by reduced inequality and the answer was no there's no evidence that they are and what that points to and this is something very fundamental it's even it's far more fundamental than than political is that inequality is the rule in cooperative slash competitive organizations you can't positive value without producing a hierarchy right because you positive value say this is worth doing everyone says yeah this is worth doing well then what happens automatically is that some people are better at doing it than other people no matter what it is when they get better and better at it like the way to principle you talk about to and then they start getting better at it so the problem is is that without you with if you're going to positive value which you have to do if you're going to act and immediately you create a hierarchy and you also build into the value claim the claim that a is better than b you also build into that the idea that if a is better than b then [MUDITA: people who are doing better at a should be differentially rewarded compared to people who aren't] there's no way around that if you're going to play the game and so in it you're stuck with inequality but there isn't any evidence that that social engineering policies are really very good at dispensing with inequality which is a fundamental political problem and no one really knows what to do about it but [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: criticizing the entire society] I mean the thing about the West and this is increasingly true all over the world is that [HOPE: it's generating our approach generates a tremendous amount of wealth] for I mean it even happened in China you know despite their exceptionally totalitarian leanings and so you what happens with the lefties is that [ENVY: they say well inequality is a consequence of the West and a consequence of capitalism which is a palpably false claim and say well because it produces inequality then it's a corrupt system] it's like no every system produces inequality but [MUDITA: hardly any also produce wealth that's correct in mobility and and reward for creativity entrepreneurial activity and risk taken] that's that's something that the the free market system is quite unique at and whereas a more neo-mark system view how do you get rich and a socialist you run for a political office that's true exploitation is you run on the best intentions of the public while implementing what you believe to be the best socially engineered construct [FEAR: look at Venezuela I mean the leaders are doing just fine meanwhile people are dying oh yeah there is a complete catastrophe 13,000% inflation so on and so forth] so I have a question for you and and I've watched hundreds of hours of your content on the internet you've opened up my mind in ways I cannot describe you've made me a better speaker you've made me a better lecture a better person more organized more I can draw direct corollary to our organization's budget and everything from when I first interacted with your content because I had never heard anyone describe the reality of life [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: life is suffering what are you gonna do about it it's just so bluntly and so directly but with struggle up the damn that's exactly right with a roadmap to deal with that] because and I'll tell you something cool and then I'll give you a question okay no no no no no no problem we have this program and it might be something the future offer your organization yeah I've used it with people have that with drug huh huh well we we have a fairly new study that came out last year from Mohawk College which is a junior college with a vocational element and the kids came in during the summer in their orientation and spent just an hour writing out their life plan right how how they what they would like to have in their life across six standard dimensions intimate relationship family education care of their own mental and physical health strategies for dealing with temptation like drug and alcohol use useful application of their time outside of out of outside of their obligations so the question is it's like it's it's it's sort of predicated on a New Testament principle I would say in part which is you know if you could have what you wanted by asking what what would you ask asking you shall receive exactly knock knock and you will answer right exactly in Matthew yeah exactly it's in Matthew and and the idea there I think from a psychological perspective is is that while you're not going to get what you want unless you know what it is and you're not going to target unless you aim for it course and you can't even organize your perceptions in relationship to the world unless you have a goal okay so you write down what you think you might want and need in order to stand your life and then you write for a while about how what your life could be like in three to five years if if you put your if you what what your vision would be for your life three to five years and then you write a counter vision which is an analysis of where you might be in three to five years if you let all your bad habits take the upper hand and then you write a plan okay and it takes a long time to do a really good job of that but it turns out that you can do a bad job of it in about an hour and so we had the kids at Mohawk do it for an hour when they came in for their summer orientation and [HOPE: it knocked the dropout rate for young men down 50%] and so I thought it just just blew me away because it's sad you know I thought just look at that if you get young guys to sit down and think for an hour about what they would like their life to be it decreases the probability that they'll drop out of college by 50% it's like what the hell man kind of correlation it's just stunning what's and we have three studies demonstrate that was the biggest I've seen it I I'm dealing currently with one of my best high school buddies that was on opioids it's a huge problem in America yeah and I'm guessing here in Canada it is as well I'm not as well versed in it and I sat him down and I did the future authoring program and it changed his life and you know and I made him watch all your videos and yeah he came hooked on it and it saved no be it's probably well yeah you saved his life I can say that and you changed my life I wouldn't say you say because I wasn't in that same dire condition but the number one thing I said to him I said listen buddy I'm not gonna use his name to protect his privacy I said your whole life you've been seeking freedom he's like yeah that's whatever I've been told I said things in life that give you meaning will come from responsibility and that's that's what clicked one of the things that you said that really clicked with me yeah that's a good thing to know man [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have inundated especially young men yeah go seek freedom go do what you want how you want to do it when you want to do which is fine there's nothing inherently wrong to that when you're young but if you really want meaning if you want satisfaction if you want direction it's the stuff that has consequence it's family work that's exactly right freedom is freedom we're not teaching young men that no intentionally that's the other thing I wanted to get to but go right I think it's intentional] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I think it is too because it's part and parcel of the idea that the productive activity of young men and this also goes for the masculine symbolically masculine activity of young women by the way but the productive activity of young men is indistinguishable from the force that gives rise to the to the crushing tyranny of the patriarchy] it's like well and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: that also gives young men a moral excuse not to engage in life] it's like well you know productive activity I see it all the time I've been told them a horrible person my whole life what use is this to me I'm gonna go play video games in my basement yeah [ENVY: I've been told from all my teachers my parents that you know it's rigged you know that I'm a horrible individual just because I'm a man] and it really diminishes a men that might want to succeed and I see it happen all the time yeah [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: well it gives an excuse to the useless part of men that don't want to succeed] because it's easy to sit around I mean it isn't because of the long-term consequences of that are just absolutely devastating yes but you see so when we have a discussion about freedom you know we might also say well the freedom is I think this is right is for its freedom to pick your poison it's freedom to pick your responsibility that's you might say well that there's there's a set of weights in front of you that you have to pick up in order to stand yourself because that's the other thing I think about human beings well you know [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we conscientiousness is a trait and it we don't have an animal model for conscientiousness in fact we don't understand conscientiousness at all from from from a psychological or Darwinian perspective] well that's that's more complicated because conscientious men tend to do better and so they're going to be more successful but but we don't have a model for what conscientiousness is but but conscientiousness is at least in part this the the necessity to carry a load for yourself and for other people or to suffer guilt and shame as a consequence and so that's that seems built in especially to conscientious people now conscientious people tend more tend to be more conservative because that's one of the predictors of conservatism but it could easily be that freedom is the freedom to choose your yoke let's say and and then you choose the weight that you have to carry so that you can justify your miserable existence to yourself so that you can go to bed at the end of the night and you can think look I I did what I needed to do to set things right today and I don't have to carry the existential weight around of my failure and uselessness as a consequence the existential psychologists in the 1950s who emerged out of the chaos of World War two were very much very much concentrated on the idea of existential guilt you know that you owed you owed being a ransom for your existence and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the way that you paid that ransom was to work for the betterment of being] I mean it's a very ancient idea but of course but it is the one idea I think that gives people the self-respect not self-esteem the self-respect that's necessary to carry them through terrible times and to use a story that people are familiar with when I'm asked what what is Jordan Peterson done for your members of people you know I say he hasn't stopped acting like Peter Pan hmm so I think they can actually be a man and not a boy the Peter Pan story is really interesting one a because Peter Pan Pan means everything right technically that's what Pan means and Peter Pan wants to be a child because a child can be anything can be everything right so what you have in childhood is that a plethora of potential and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the problem with growing up is that you have to sacrifice that that Pan potential for a defined actuality right that's that's that's to grow up and become something instead of staying potentially anything] now the problem with Peter Pan is that he looks into the world and and sees Captain Hook as his role model right and so that's his model for for adulthood and hook is terrified of death that's the crocodile is chasing him with a clock in his stomach and the crocodile already has a piece of him it's got a taste of him and so hook is constantly chased by the dragon of chaos essentially that's already got a taste of him and because hook is terrified of his own mortality and terrified in general he's a tyrant and so Pan looks at hook and says well if that's adulthood I'd rather stay king of the lost boys that's exactly right and so yeah and it's a very powerful story well which is why people still tell it a hundred years later that's correct but [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: what I see at least from my experience is that the idea of staying a boy is idolized and is more culturally acceptable in America than ever has been] and it's almost as if that you ask a young man that is generally on the direction towards hopelessness and just kind of what you bring men out of it is they look towards that MTV VH1 lifestyle of being able to do whatever you want to do how you want to do it get extraordinarily drunk have no responsibility be with women all day long what happens you do that for a couple years you end up a horribly miserable person and so but here's my question is yeah you don't want to be the oldest guy at the front party no that's correct but that's pretty dismal but it's here's my here's my distinction though is that in some ways it's the women that are embracing the masculine archetype in some ways that are being successful I mean they're they're being extraordinarily responsible and they're they're feeling a lot of these positions quicker than men can I mean they're and they're graduating in higher rates of college and they're declining they're declining motherhood or they're at least suspending it throughout the West which is you could argue for either ways there's reasons for that but I guess my question is I think that the expression of the masculine spirit in women isn't denigrated like [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: women don't get accused of contributing to the patriarchy even when they take positions in society that you would think are fully patriarchal] you know and which is a strange thing so women who go to law school and then practice as corporate lawyers say aren't subject to the same what would you call it claim that their activity is facilitating the decline of the planet yes I guess because they're seen as well there because of their gender I suppose they're seen as as leaders of the rebellion against the patriarchal spirit even though structurally it boils down to the same thing sure so that masculine classically masculine symbolically masculine yearning for hierarchical productivity and competition is rewarded in women but not in men and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: which is also a very perverse thing because it doesn't make any sense it makes sense through the post-modernist view which is they're just undoing the oppressorship of the man in the last hundred fifty years so the ends justify the means that's the way they look at it whatever power women can take from men is a good thing that's the way they look at it] well there's a funny thing about that too that I reviewed this in 12 rules for life I was looking at some of the Pew research data and I don't remember the figures precisely but over the last 15 years the percentage of women who young women who claim that they would like to be married in a permanent relationship has gone up a substantial amount I don't remember what it was a 50% approximately springs to mind but a lot at the same time it's declined almost the same degree among young men and so what's what's perverse about this this is something I've talked to my daughter a fair bit about is that I mean if you ask young women what they want I don't know if they can answer because I don't know if they know if they're 19 or 20 because I think their heads are so muddled by what they've been told that they don't really know that's got my sense is that women want the opportunity to develop their career in whatever direction they see fit and fair enough but they want an intimate relationship and usually a monogamous one that's permanent and they want to have the opportunity to have kids and what you see happening inevitably and I believe this to be the case I've watched very carefully as I've grown up and got older because I've worked with women my whole life is that [COHESIVE_GOALS: women are less compelled by their career as they approach their 30s and more compelled by the desire to have a permanent relationship as a family biological to I would argue to] well I mean I I I think it's it's a biological necessity because women have to have children relatively young that's correct but it's interesting to watch it phenomenologically and even the women that I've seen who've had very high power careers is that as they move into their especially their early 30s they start to realize that the career is a pretty one-dimensional enterprise even if it's a good career because even good careers are still jobs and good careers are also very hard jobs they're like 70 hour a week jobs and their full bore commitment jobs and to figure out how to have a career like that and to have a life to have a family to have an intimate relationship to have children and then to also be able to take care of them that's a very complex that's a very complex job to manage and so what's strange is I think what's strange is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the very things that the radicals are undermining like the monogamous family are actually those things that women most want especially as they approach their 30s] and so [FEAR: this is a catastrophe on both ends of the of the gender distribution] so if there's one thing I would love to get your opinion and take on is and I deal with these college radicals is the at least the professors the people that should know better of the roots of Western civilization the only description that I could give to their motivation is [ENMITY: some people just want to see the world burn] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's almost as if they want chaos for the sake that they were not able to contribute meaning] me I would love your take on that from a social law about this and I thought about it what is their intention what is well the question is to some degree what's the intention of [ENVY: resentment and failure] yes that's correct look let's say that you let's say that you everything hasn't turned out for you the way you want it and you're angry about that and [ENVY: maybe you're angry about the people who have been successful because they cast you in a dim light] and so [ENVY: there's the anger that motivates the desire for destruction that's resentment] right and you never want to estimate evil try right you know greed envy and resentment something something like that's correct yeah it's arrogance deceit and resentment that's that's a bad tryout that'll take you down and the thing about the thing so there's anger and maybe you in the anger you want everything to burn but there's also the idea too that and this is part of the reason that inequality actually is a problem for people on the right on and on the left is that [FEAR: if you put people in a position where they don't have what they need and want and they can't see a way to get it they have high motivation to flip the game board over and start again or maybe to try to play a new game] and so part of the reason that those on the right for example have to be careful not only to raise wealth overall but also to be careful about inequality is that as society has become more unequal the motivation for those who feel dispossessed to flip the entire game over grows and grows quite rapidly and I see that sort of resentment in the universities although it's to some degree it's difficult to say why because of course university professors aren't unsuccessful by any stretch of the imagination well compensated and they're very they're very secure positions but but there's still an anti-capitalist ethos that runs through the universities that's difficult to make a to make a case for is it is it and this is what I try to figure out is it that I know better than you sort of thing and you deal with these professors is it that I'm a smarter individual and [ENVY: I we can create society more equitably] yeah it's partly that it's a hubris right yeah that's partly that the rational is to cubris yeah absolutely that you know that you can systematize utopia and that you're smart enough to do that I have a doctorate I could figure this stuff out so well and that your systematizing of utopia isn't going to generate unexpected consequences now you know social scientists should be much smarter than that because if you're a social scientist who has any sense what you learn from your research is that the probability that you can predict the outcome of your procedure which is what you're trying to do as a scientist is very low you run an experiment predicated on a hypothesis you put the procedure in place that's supposed to put supposed to produce the hypothesized outcome and likely is not it doesn't and those are that's under simple conditions in the lab where you can control almost everything and then there's also the case that and and this has been well known among good social scientists for a long time is that [FEAR: large-scale social engineering projects almost never produced the results there in that are intended] they because systems are very complex and you tweak one thing and you think you're only tweaking one thing but you're tweaking 20 things and a lot of the things that you tweak inadvertently kick back and variants of that too yeah yeah so it's a it's a hard thing to because I get this question a lot from because this is all I deal with I deal with the leftist activists and the social justice mind and two things that are so important the activists are taking over governments now and at a rapid rate [FEAR: the Democrat Party in America has been taken over by the social justice neo-Marxist postmodernist left and that it's extraordinarily dangerous to the West] and but I'm always I'm always asked by people what motivates them because [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's so damn obvious the ideas that they're trying to advance don't work] I mean we have a plethora of [FEAR: we have a century of evidence that central planning will weaken societies will cause civilization chaos will not create wealth will cause debt] so what's still not a big step I think part of it is just it's actually complexity it's like I've been thinking about this and it's it's relatively straightforward to identify pathology on the right I think and basically you you look at claims of racial superiority and the right-wing identity politics types who are making claims of racial superiority everyone says well you know you're wandering down the Nazi pathway and that's unacceptable and virtually everyone you know 99% of people agree that that's a bad idea but on the left the problem is is that it's clear that some concatenation of leftist policies when taken to extreme produce a catastrophe right we've got it but it's not just the economic it's the cultural too well absolutely but the problem is it's not that easy to point to which policies you know so if you read the gulag archipelago for example solzhenitsyn's work on sure I have prison camp system he does a really good job of detailing out the relationship between the utopian policies of the Leninists and the catastrophes that occurred but it's not simple you can't point to one thing and you say oh well that's like a racial superiority or it's because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: well we want to foster inclusion of oppressed groups who could be against that all right right] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we want to we want to level the playing field] we'll go okay yeah well exactly and so in isolation each of these ideas not only sounds plausible but sounds positively beneficial but the problem is that you put a number of them together and [FEAR: somehow things tilt in a direction that's really really terrible] but isn't it this is this is the other part of it that I try to dive into I ask when I do my speeches on campuses I ask a series of five questions and one of the first question is are people good or bad by nature and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the neo-Marxists will get in front of a mic and I have these videos that have 10 15 million views where they'll try to argue me that that argue to me that people are good by nature it's just the social construct that makes them bad] that's one of the big problems here it is definitely but and you're the expert here I mean you've been doing this for you know decades and you have plethora of research my argument is always well then why do we have to teach goodness to our youth why do we have to tell young people to stop crying why do young people pit their parents against each other they were there ever taught that behavior of course not even aggression like the evidence that aggression is innate is I think it's over well I don't think it's overwhelming look at the conclusive we evolve from chimpanzees they go to war right I mean but but but that's that that's one of the key things is how did the neo-Marxists find any sort of you know any sort of intellectual consistency with believing that and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they teach young people that that this is all just a flawed social construct but we're actually good people by nature not aggressive we're not prejudiced in any sense] it's a compelling story because it's half the true you know I mean part of the reason that human endeavor is pathologized is because there's a tyrannical element to social organization sure and so you can say well people are basically good and culture makes them bad and you can tell a good story using those axioms I mean you can reverse it you can say no people are basically like uncivilized and barbaric as individuals and that only society makes them good to the degree that they're good that's the difference between Hobbes and Rousseau right because Rousseau would argue for the former and Hobbes for the latter and you can make a very strong case for both and because the case is compelling you don't necessarily hear the other side of the story sure so and that's that's the thing about ideologies is that they tend to tell half the story in a compelling way and I mean it's also kind of a nice story if you're a naive person because you think well I'm a good person and everybody else I know is good that even must come from somewhere so it's really interesting you say that so we are at UCLA and this is a very interesting thing and [ENMITY: there was a black woman that said Candacellans I think you're a white supremacist of course another black woman] and I asked her I said wait a second are you a racist are you a racist no I'm not then where's the line where does one stop becoming a racist because you're not of course right you wouldn't be saying this if you weren't so what do I have to do to be more like you it's like [ENVY: everyone else is a horrible person except me] yeah you know it's that kind of narcissism self-centeredness there's a great quote by Dennis Prager where he said growing up in the 1970s and 80s we taught our youth that they were the problem in America was a good thing now it's the exact opposite now it's that America's the problem and you're the greatest thing ever one of the most impactful analysis you ever made was kind of something Carl Jung said is you know [AMITY: treat others the way you want to be treated but that you don't always want to be treated with you know ubiquitous love and kindness you want to be sometimes have discipline lots and want that] lot I mean one of the things I've learned as a clinician well and as as a private person for that matter is that we outsource our sanity you know the psychoanalysts believed and most psychologists believe that your sanity is sort of something you carry around in your in your ego in your head and if you're saying it's because you're your psyche is well structured but that's actually not true it's true to some degree but but what's more true is that the way you stay sane is by knowing how to behave in a manner that makes you sufficiently acceptable so that other people will put up with you and then you surround yourself with other people and hopefully they're doing reasonably well and every time you do something stupid they slap you on the side of the head you know either fairly gruffly or subtly by raising an eyebrow or failing to listen to you or not not phoning you to go out for a beer on Friday night because then you change your behavior a little bit or you reflect you say we have to do something different well and you if you're lucky you have 20 people around you that are always tapping you and telling you when you're funny and witty and interesting and when you're boring and stupid you do more of that or less right right and so so you so this the social structure plays a key role in maintaining individual sanity there's no doubt about that so I want to switch this a little bit I want to get back to some things that are more specific to you so let's talk about your plans for your organization over the next couple of years and your goals you know because a critic might say well you know you're complaining about activism on the left but here you are engaging in activism and who cares if it's on the right or the left it's still activism and that carries with it all the problems of activism so I'd like you to address that but also then to say where you're headed and and how you expect to get there and why sure so at first I would say [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have to reclaim the term activism activism for the right ideas is virtuous and correct and always has been I think throughout western civilization] and we're on the side now [COHESIVE_GOALS: we're fighting for intellectual and ideological diversity and free speech] now activism does not necessarily mean you have to storm the president's office or defy you know the rules that be but [COHESIVE_GOALS: it does mean you try to be disruptive on campus wherever mean necessary as long as you're not doing what the left does which is trying to suppress someone else's rights to speech or try to you know destroy private property] so I'll give you a great example me going to UC Berkeley with Dave Ruman and Candace Owens that's a form of activism we were welcomed by our group there on campus and the young republican group but there was petitions trying to get us off campus [ENMITY: there was immense hostility the administration did not want us there] we had to pay thousands of dollars for security fees and for police yeah that whole security fee thing that's pretty that's extraordinarily cumbersome well and it intentionally so underhanded absolutely it's so unbelievably underhanded and so there's some there's an interesting distinction here that I want to I want to make and I'd love to get your analysis I don't want to deviate too much from your question but for doing this for the years I've done this almost daily one of our groups will get disinvited from campus have their funding cut well I will get shouted down fire alarms poles windows smashed daily conservatives will try to get disinvited from campus [AMITY: I've never once seen a conservative student a student group a conservative group or conservative professor try to disinvite or try to prevent a liberal from coming on campus not once] so you have here [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the left being the predominant political viewpoint on college campuses a monopoly yet they do everything they can to prevent anyone else from challenging that viewpoint] and we conservatives are in the political minority and [AMITY: we perfectly allow the free discussion free flow of ideas] so to answer your question at least from the activism standpoint if someone would be a critic and they say well trial you're just doing the left is doing no [AMITY: I will defend a socialist's right to be wrong to the death I think that free speech and dialogue discussion is is the solution] well I do think too that [AMITY: marketplace of ideas civil behavior is unbelievably useful] you know one of the things that I've experienced over the last couple of years is that if I keep my head and I stay reasonable in the face of provocation which can be very severe at times fire alarms being pulled and people blowing air horns you know a foot away from me and and getting in my face in a serious way as I'm leaving places that I've been speaking and carrying a garot which is you know really pushing it a bit too far as far as I'm concerned and pounding on windows and doors and you're barricading sure yeah well it's primal a [COHESIVE_GOALS: good thing to really teach your your participants is that they're to remain civil and not to engage in acts that discredit them regardless of the provocation and that's no firearm alarm pulling that's no yelling people down civil dialogue and proper behavior and we win converts by doing that] and um and I'll send you a couple videos of and I've taken a cue from you the way you handled that BBC interview which one channel four yeah so I'm sorry yeah that's okay UK um it was extraordinary you had every right to pull her tongue out she was being just I mean it was almost impressively ignorant what she was doing yet you remain so calm and so in control and I think if you even though you had a right to do it if you would have went a little bit more towards the direction of abrasiveness or confrontational you wouldn't have been as effective I learned something you know and this is something that's worth knowing is that just because you're being attacked doesn't mean that's a bad thing you know like for now let's say that I go and and give a talk well two things can happen I can either give the talk and film that and put it on YouTube and then there's the advantages of that or I can go give the talk and be shouted down and by protesters like the ones at Queen's University I literally stormed the stage I saw the video and you handled it beautifully and then you said something like this is exactly you know why we're doing what we're doing or something well there's a couple of things the first thing is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's not such a terrible thing for people who are unreasonable to manifest their unreasonableness and then to have that publicized that's a good thing] we do a lot of it and the second thing is is that just so there's the event which would be the place that you're speaking but then that's not the event because all of this is filmed the event could easily be in the two months after it that's good and and so one of the ways that you can keep your head in this sort of situation is to understand that it isn't obvious when things are unfolding what's good and what isn't and if you well like that interview sure I mean my sense of the interview was that they were going to just cut it to five minutes which is what they broadcast and do everything they could to make me look like a fool you know but they put the whole thing up because they didn't have any idea what happened in that interview no one knew it's not like Channel 4 knew that that was a disaster and they put it up anyways they thought the interview went fine and then we're absolutely shocked by the public response but by that time it was too late to bring it down but my point is that it's a lot easier to keep your head if you don't jump to conclusions about what's happening in the moment being what's actually happening it's like [HOPE: it's a long game this it's not a short game] it's so interesting you say that so I went to the the anti-gun march in Washington DC and I went and challenged some of these anti-gun protesters and I had someone follow me around with a camera and I had four hours of discussions with people there was one discussion that I didn't even remember with a woman it was about second amendment rights we put it up nine and a half million views and I couldn't understand what it was and she was kind of getting very abrasive but she was saying such crazy things but I must have struck a chord and so interesting to say that that there's there's two realities and really there's one where you have it's how it's perceived when you're there how people feel it and how it sounds you know echolocation-wise and all that but also the people that watch it when you cut it up or the video afterwards which in some ways is even more powerful well it's it's it is more powerful period well this is also why I think it's so useful just to say what you think you know in a more fundamental way because [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: one of the ideas that has guided me in doing what I've been doing is that you want to let go of the consequences of your actions and say what you believe to be true] that doesn't mean you should be a fool about it or that you should say everything all the time but the reason that you this is this fundamental hallmark of faith I believe in faith in the truest sense is the belief that [HOPE: truthful speech redeems the world] and that's a weird faith because what that means is that let's say you say some things and you're doing your best to be truthful and you get in trouble you think oh my god that didn't work it's like actually you don't know whether or not it worked because you can't calculate the full consequences of your action and so it could be that it worked just fine but it was painful in the short term and lots of things that work fine are painful in the short term and so there is a leap of faith that has to be made and I think that the reason that the biblical corpus is so powerful in part is because it's predicated on the fundamental assumption that [HOPE: truthful speech turns the potential of reality the truth the truth tells that you free] well that which is which is who the hell would ever believe that right because that isn't what that isn't how it looks what it looks like is that the truth will get you in trouble of course but what happens is it gets you in trouble in the short term and and frees you in other people in the medium to long term and so okay so back to your plan sorry where are you headed of course so [COHESIVE_GOALS: the organization is is growing rather dramatically it's quite exciting so we have what's called vision 2020 we want to help move youth sentiment towards free enterprise and free speech kind of those general issues 20 points by 2020 so we're ramping up our organization dramatically] um to hopefully a 20 million dollar budget and the higher you know over 200 people across the states which will be a monumental accomplishment to be able to do this in the your field staffers these are organizers and in some ways my whole perspective from the very beginning I called ourselves the move on dot org or the right now move on dot org is a political social activism organization based in the states for far left wing causes I don't and to this day this is what drives our organization [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I don't think the left should have a monopoly on grassroots activism and they almost always have] um there's no reason for that lot the biggest is that [HOPE: we have a built-in counter-revolution brewing on our college campus as a students that are being punished for thinking differently and there is an organic uprising of students that are joining our organization attending our events you know implementing leadership positions in student government in other places] um because they're fed up they've had enough and I can't tell you well it would be really good if if for about 15 years it wasn't the most left-leaning radicals who controlled the student newspapers and the student unions it's been like that since I went to college back in the 1990s part of the programming we're implementing is [COHESIVE_GOALS: encouraging our students to run for student leadership on campus rather successfully] um and there's a lot there's a lot that we can show to actually change the campus culture and climate by doing so that that these student unions aren't divesting from fossil fuels fuels or saying there's no such thing as genders or [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: just astonishingly radical you know sentiments] and so as an organization more broadly um there's a lot of different ways we measure success things I could talk about publicly and things I can't talk about publicly um but [FEAR: we we are very concerned about the current trajectory of the west] and [FEAR: I believe and I said this many times I believe the greatest threat to western civilization is what's happening on American college campuses] um it's even more so than any other geopolitical foe it's more so than what's happening in washington dc because more than anything else [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you have a generation that has been inculcated to believe that america is a mistake everything about the west is wrong] well the thing is there america is a mistake and so is the west but compared to other mistakes it's pretty damn good like you said it's life is suffering it's it's finding the worst it's finding the best worst model that is possible and what's so divine I think about what the founding fathers realized is they said yeah people suck that systems get corrupted yeah civilizations are ruined things fall apart yeah essentially so [COHESIVE_GOALS: how do we decentralize that to the furthest extent so that we can have a hedge against the inevitability of human demands] I agree with you completely I do think that that was that's the fundamental stroke of genius it isn't how can we bring about utopia is [COHESIVE_GOALS: how can we design a system that idiots can't screw up too badly given that we're all idiots precisely] yeah yeah that's real wisdom and it's and it's it's wisdom it's real humility too it is it is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's real humility as well it means that you don't overreach yourself is that you're not presuming that you know enough to bring about heaven on earth but that maybe you can stave off the worst excesses of hell] that's right and what what what we teach our students and what's not taught in our schools is the american founding was the first political revolution where the victors voluntarily gave up political power right wash it could have been the washingtonian hamiltonian jeffersonian monarchy that ruled america for the next 200 years they would have done quite well rich and natural resources unaccompanied land that they could have took over but what was so amazing to them and their motivations I believe were pure is that they wanted to try something completely and totally different they did not want to embrace that which they rebelled against and as you said the humility for them to implement a system has been replicated all throughout the west I mean the idea of natural rights and decentralized government and democratic elections in a constitution republic [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's what built western civilization spain portugal france denmark they all have some form of that governance a little differences here and there] and but now [FEAR: that's being challenged that wealth of prosperity and standard of living increase and human rights accomplishments is now being in our university say no no that was this is all wrong this is all a racist homophobic bigoted construct designed to benefit white males it's a patriarch we must uproot the system] and so more broadly um [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we we are unbelievably privileged and blessed to live in western civilization even more specifically as an american i'm lucky to live in america and i'm going to fight every single day through the conduits and the vehicles that i've created to try to save this experiment] yeah [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: well i mean the the the the move that makes that something other than jingoistic patriotism is the move that says this is all good fortune and that and and that we should be grateful for that] and that our moral obligation is to sustain that to take up the responsibility necessary to sustain that and to improve it it's not ours by birthright not not by any means this is also why you know i'm i'm loath to this is why [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: i have trouble with right wing identitarianism because the right wing identitarians tend to take to themselves the positive attributes of their states without having to do the work necessary to place themselves among the people who are the actual founders] without a doubt so it's [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: identity politics of the right] yeah so all right so where can people learn more about your organization so that they can go to our website tpusa.com we have a massive conference coming up that i mentioned that we'd love to you know of course have you key note and your and i'll say that i don't know if i said this but if i repeat myself i apologize you know i've seen you save people's lives and you've changed my own and you're by far the most requested speaker and i guess the question i have for you in the time the short time we have remaining i guess is um have you have you seen any of this visibility or popularity or fame change you or at least change your pattern or your style of life or any of that no it's completely changed it in some ways how do you how do you keep order in this because it's chaotic isn't it i'm yeah very well i i from the master of order i have to ask sure you know so i have more and more people helping me all the time and [AMITY: we've been fortunate because we meaning my family because we've gone through this as a family we've been fortunate that people who have the expertise necessary to help us with this have showed up at opportune times] and i've have enough people around me with their eyes open to help me point myself in the right direction and avail myself of that help i would say what it's done to me personally mostly is just to make me more um careful because [FEAR: the costs of mistakes are while the cost of mistakes for me over the last two years have been incredibly high because people have been watching my every move including things that i've done in the past to see if there's any credible evidence that i'm any of the terrible things that people would like me to be] because [ENMITY: it's a pain in the neck for my leftist um opponents let's say if i'm not a brute] because then i have to be contended with seriously and so everything i've said and done has been gone over with a fine tooth comb and luckily so far that's worked out although you know that's grace of god and all that and so mostly it's made me more careful and more awake and more nervous all at the same time yeah i just i wanted to say that you've you've kept an unbelievable discipline of consistency throughout your career and what i always joke around fear will do that to you well in proper humility which you have and um if you read enough 20th century history and you actually try to understand that that'll make you humble enough well because you start thinking that if you have any sense and you read that history you don't read it as a victim and you don't read it as the person that would set things right [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: you read it as a perpetrator and you think oh yeah so that's what people that's what really that's what i'm like that's what really um again open my eyes one of the stuff you said is imagine being a prison guard in oschwitz worse imagine enjoying it though] that's right imagine benefiting from it right which which you would and you think you're such a good guy really you'd stand up to the ss if you were part of them and as you said [FEAR: the real evil of hitler is he didn't even use the utility of the jews he tried to kill more as his civilization was crushing around him that's sinister stuff i mean it would have made more sense to put in the work camps to make rifles and you know and bombs instead he tried to kill more of them anyway well that that does seem to indicate that the fundamental motivation was destruction regardless of the overlaying story which i think is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis] okay so let's say again the website sure it's uh tpusa.com so tpusa.com uh they can follow me on twitter uh charlie kerke 11 and um [COHESIVE_GOALS: we're we're fighting for the ideas that that created west] yeah well it would be nice you know to to think hard about how a couple of things that might be useful adjuncts and maybe you guys have thought this through to your organization is you know [COHESIVE_GOALS: there are places like the founder institute in california that are doing everything they can to start to help early stage entrepreneurs] and it might be really nice to make part of your um your message yes [COHESIVE_GOALS: the the necessity for the people who are part of your organization to to make a life plan to figure out how they're putting themselves together as individuals and to center the activism on that and then to say well you have to stand up and talk and speak whenever you're right to do that or your responsibility to do that is being interfered with but the fundamental thing that you have to concentrate on is putting your life in order that's that keeps the hubris at bay at least to some degree that's correct] and you have 1200 women coming together in june that's correct and that's in phoenix that's in dallas of course you have an open invite to everything and anything well that's cure that that'd be something well i'm interested in both of those you know i would like to i haven't spoken enough to young women i don't think well and we're doing a young men's summit i think next summer too i love the design around you but the young women is interesting i'll tell you why um i it is extraordinarily hard to be a young conservative on american college campus it is a multiple of difficult to be a young conservative woman there's an expectancy of leftism there is a hostility towards espousing any sort of conservative beliefs and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the gathering of young ladies together in this kind in a in a summit if you will which has grown dramatically at 300 800 and i will have 1200 has been so useful] and i'm a very firm believer in um gender segregated education at times and that's a horrible term you know what i mean essentially having women only events um there's something quite special that happens and same with men only events that's where the fraternity and sorority structure came across in north america so we'd love to have you maybe take a look at that um yeah well i'd that would be i'll do that we can stay in touch about that and so all right well thank you i guess we should probably bring this to a close so great honor thank you very much for agreeing to no thank you this is one of the greatest honors my life thank you the problem with wanting to be friends with your child is that that's not good enough because as a parent you're not less than a friend you're far more than a friend you're someone that's going to be in the child's life for the duration of your life with any luck [AMITY: you're a long-term island of stability in a sea of turbulence and the child needs that far more than than he or she needs a friend] [COHESIVE_GOALS: parents need to be courageous because they have to let their children go and make mistakes you have to let your child fall when they're learning to walk they bump themselves up against the world a lot and you don't want to do any more for your child than you absolutely have to and it means that there's a certain amount of detached harshness that has to go along with your love and compassion you have to stand back and let your child stumble forward towards mastery] [FEAR: today's parents are terrified of their children because they're often afraid that if they intervene in their lives that they'll make a mistake and that that will be irrevocable] and [HOPE: you have to have the courage of your convictions when you have children and you have to understand that if you do make mistakes that you can learn and you can be forgiven you don't have to be a perfect parent although you should aim up with your children] [FEAR: parents are terrified of making mistakes and that means that they're terrified of being parents and they and that stops them from being parents and you]\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n**Self-Correction/Refinement during Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity**: Initially, I considered that the strong \"us vs. them\" framing might overwhelm individual dignity. However, a core part of the speakers' argument is that *their side* champions universal human worth, free speech, and merit, while the *other side* undermines it and dehumanizes. So, Individual Dignity is often discussed as something that is *lacking* due to the \"left,\" making its implicit positive value salient. The \"subspecies of them\" quote is particularly strong for Tribal Dominance, indicating dehumanization attributed to the perceived out-group. Peterson's points on individual responsibility and truth are also directly relevant to Individual Dignity.\n\n2.  **Envy vs. Mudita**: There's a clear attribution of \"envy\" to the \"pathological left,\" framed as a \"war on competence\" and \"zero-sum thinking.\" Mudita, in contrast, is present not so much as explicit celebration of individual successes within the document, but more as a *defense* of the system that allows for and rewards competence, creativity, and risk-taking (e.g., free markets). This defense of the *principle* of celebrating merit is what drives Mudita's score, even if explicit expressions of joy are minimal. Its salience is lower than Envy's because it's a defensive position rather than an active celebratory one in this specific discourse.\n\n3.  **Amity**: This dimension is consistently low. While there are mentions of \"free discussion\" and \"civil behavior,\" these are usually presented as ideals *their side* upholds, often contrasted with the \"hostility\" and \"silencing\" tactics attributed to the \"left.\" There's no real appeal to cooperation or friendship across the ideological divide, but rather a call to maintain civility *despite* the conflict.\n\n4.  **Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals**: Both are quite strong. Fragmentative Goals are heavily attributed to the opposition (\"destroy,\" \"undermine,\" \"break apart\"). Cohesive Goals are clearly articulated as the objectives of TPUSA and the underlying principles of Western civilization they aim to uphold (\"turn around,\" \"build,\" \"save this experiment,\" \"bring together\" (in terms of values)). The goals of the \"left\" are seen as fragmentative, while the goals of the speakers are cohesive (for their side/values).\n\n5.  **Salience Considerations**: For dimensions like Fear, Tribal Dominance, Enmity, Envy, Fragmentative Goals, the salience is high because these concepts (or the attribution of them to the opposition) form the core motivation and central theme of the interview, often appearing throughout the discussion and framing the speakers' entire worldview. For Hope and Cohesive Goals, salience is also high because they represent the proactive solution and future vision. Mudita and Amity have lower salience as they are less directly discussed, even if implicitly present or presented as ideals.\n\nThe length of the document required diligent inline markup.

\"marked_up_document\": \"# Document Analysis - Marked Up Text\\n\\nHash: bb976cc552e17c59\\nContent:\\n Today with in a new place trying out something new I'm talking to Charlie Kirk and Charlie is a native of Chicago and he's been working building an organization in the US to promote free speech on campuses for for how long now? It's been six years now. Okay well I'm gonna let you take it away and tell people exactly what you've been up to. Sure so I started this organization called Turning Point USA when I was 18 years old took a very unusual path to it I decided to start this movement instead of going to college. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I saw something brewing in the states that I felt more instinctual than anything else that there was a counter-cultural kind of revolution that needed to happen on our college and high school campuses] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: and I saw it through social media and I saw it through my local high school community that my generation was being so inundated with cultural Marxism and also economic Marxism but even worse it was the cultural side of it] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: and that my generation was yearning for a different perspective and political viewpoint or at least ideological diversity and the capacity to have your viewpoints challenged] so what started as kind of a whim has ended up to be a quite you know large success when I started this organization I had no idea what I was doing I had no political connections and no money so that that was a good start so what so you you started thinking about this when you were in high school that's correct okay so what happened in high school and how did you come to these conclusions and what motivated you always loved history economics and of the more conservative persuasion my lifelong ambition I wanted to go to the United States Military Academy at West Point which is a very difficult school to get into in the states so I got my congressional nomination which is the first of a two-step process and then I ended up being waitlist that and denied on my senior year of high school which totally shattered me but ended up being the best thing that never happened to me because it really made me reflect on who I was and what I wanted to do and what I realized my motivation to go to the Military Academy was that I was a patriot and I love my country and I wanted to serve it in some capacity but [FEAR: I felt like the West was under attack and I still feel that to this day] so so why do you think you developed a sense of patriotism and in say junior high and high school when when that is increasingly lacking I would say but not only lacking but seriously criticized what made you different it's difficult to say I definitely love the my country based on my upbringing but my parents are generally center right people and we're always taught you know patriotic values from a young age read the Constitution you know around the dinner table things like that but I'm disagreeable by nature and so when my parent when my teachers would go out of their way to make anti-American or anti-patriotic statements it only made me reaffirm my own beliefs and dig in deeper and want to challenge that even more which I then sought out the great thinkers of the American founding the Federalist Papers the US Constitution and down that rabbit hole I went to the great thinkers that created Western civilization both intentionally and unintentionally whether it be Aristotle and all the great you know enlightened you know thousands of years of writings that the founding fathers drew inspiration from and did you do that on your own that's correct it was autodidactics so it was self-taught in middle school as well but it was it was driven by this inspiration of I wanted to be able to effectively articulate my beliefs and values and ideas to a core of teachers that felt as if [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they had to indoctrinate me to hate America hate free enterprise and hate free speech] so I grew up in a rather generally liberal area the Northwest suburbs of Chicago and the teacher community for the most part [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they were not trying to allow a free flow of ideas they were trying to impose a specific doctrine upon their students] and being a disagreeable contrarian by nature I would always debate them and I would find satisfaction in proving them wrong as you know as wrong or right as that might be that's just who I was it's who always have been and then by doing so I sought out these books I set out these ideas and I found Milton Friedman and I found individuals that that articulated what I knew to be true and I only went down that path even further so what did that do for your social life just out of curiosity how are your how are your peers reacting to this so it's quite interesting you you mentioned that throughout high school I was heavily involved in football and basketball and you know generally well liked individual ever since my graduation of high school and my entrance into political and social activism [ENMITY: the hostility towards my high from my high school community towards me has been extreme] and I'm not trying to play a victim I'm fine with it I really those people were never my friends they just pretended to be them to beat to be as such but it's amazing to me that you just have a different viewpoint on how the world should work that [ENMITY: people on the left will immediately ostracize you and categorize you differently] and I always say you know I'm a conservative I don't look at people that are on the left any differently than I did I look at who they are as a character and as a person and the politics are just layered on top of that the left is completely different is if you disagree with them that's who you become and I think that's one of the [ENMITY: most cancerous and divisive aspects of you know modern political culture today] is that especially my generation [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you dare not be a leftist or dare not be a liberal then you're somehow less human or you're somehow less acceptable to them or you're immediately intolerant or racist or bigoted or homophobic which of course is untrue] but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it's almost as if they view you as a subspecies of them] which I'm experiencing every day and some of the categorizations thrown towards you it seems that in popular culture that remains consistent so okay so tell me about your organization tell me it's scope now and what you've been doing and then we can talk about how you built it of course so we're on 1300 college and high school campuses across the states we have 115 people on full time staff and last year we raised 10 and a half million dollars with 25,000 active donors and some big ones and some small ones with some of the you know largest most successful American business people that have been investing in us and I just started it from nothing just I travel 340 days a year and meeting with investors and business people and entrepreneurs that are worried that [FEAR: America's in a grave decline] and I'm able to present them with a [HOPE: strategy and a plan and a vision that can help turn that around] no pun intended organizations called Turning Point USA and so we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives will have 5,000 students there this upcoming December of which you're the most requested speaker off the charts I might add and the scope of the organization is dramatic and immense well we have a young women's leadership summit in June we'll have 1200 young ladies from across from all 50 states attend that's in June in Dallas Texas and so we'll host over a hundred events a year off campus with over 250 student activists and leaders that we train towards what I like to call more principal based activism things that you know created the West free speech dialogue free enterprise private property rights natural rights really diving into the deep ideas not this sort of [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: social justice leftist activism that is taught from our lecture halls] so the scope of the organization has really grown dramatically we're on a 15 million dollar budget this year and it's it's been quite an experience and a blessing to say the least right place right time with a great group of people and how many how many campuses now 1300 college and high school campuses represented throughout the states and so what's happening at the high school level chapter development it's quite interesting we have seen an explosion of high school interest and chapter development over the last couple years especially because the activism that is so prevalent in our colleges has now seeped down into our high schools and so students that are finding my videos are finding Dave Rubin or Ben Shapiro Dennis Prager your content they're now 1415 and 16 and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: they seek out that content because they have to if they want to be able to defend their beliefs] because it used to be that college used to be the only place that these ideas were really not the only place I should say but the the the main focus of the left was colleges no more I mean they are teaching the the beginning stages of postmodernism as early as freshman years in high school where there is no such thing as absolutely true or in Ontario as early as grade one that's correct yeah that's right and in Ontario the elementary teachers association that's not quite the right name maybe it's Ontario teachers Federation I can't remember at the moment but they've put in they've put together a social justice curriculum from grade one to grade eight which even bends the study of literature itself in a social justice direction so [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they're so shameless that they're willing to bend art to the purposes of political propaganda] it's stunning it is it's quite remarkable so what do you expect from the high school chapters what do you what what is it that they're doing that you think is good and useful so it's a different strategy and it's different implementation that our staff goes about when they deal with high school students the number one thing with high school students high school chapters that we deal with is trying to make it culturally acceptable to believe these conservative ideas so even if they meet weekly and bring in a guest speaker of a you know local you know political nature or they watch video it's much more of a camaraderie building activity in high school than in college and I say that because it the mindset of being in high school is quite different in college you're you're entering into kind of that rugged independence I want to rebel or conform to my parents ideology in high school you still are still very much anchored to your local and cultural institutions your high school football team your basketball team and so but we hear that's exactly right whereas college by the the dynamic of the geography of college you break you try to break out of that but we we we try to hold them the high school chapters to a specific standard of at least meeting weekly trying to go to some of our big national events hosting guest speakers debates and lectures so a great example is in the states there was that horrific shooting down in Parkland High School I'm gonna go down act I'm actually going down to MSD the the school where the shooting took place I'm gonna give a speech on the second amendment natural rights they're not allowing me on campus but I'm doing it right across the street so that's one of the groups we have a Tuesday coming up this Tuesday they say it's highly controversial which I don't consider it to be the second amendment is some would say a controversial you know thing people that aren't in the states but the first amendment is controversial that's exactly that's what I was gonna say is that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the idea of natural rights doesn't shouldn't offend anyone but unfortunately it does] so that's one example of an event that that I have on a high school kind of arena that I'm doing coming up okay and then at the university level you have you said 1500 so 1300 so 1300 is the number high school and college combined so that's divided about 900 college 400 high school and do you have any estimate for total membership it's difficult to say so to give you an idea we had 3000 students and attend our annual meeting last year and we had over 14,000 applications and so membership is well beyond that but it's definitely in the tens of thousands our total data list is in the hundreds of thousands we have over million Facebook followers I have a half million followers on Twitter membership is a very difficult thing to pinpoint we don't want to define that's correct we don't want to be like the AARP where you have seven million people on your mailing list and you pretend they're all members but I were very much more into the quality of leadership than the quantity of leaders so that's the one thing I'd rather have a hundred dedicated principled movement driven student leaders than a thousand that are just kind of lackluster and are there for the the free pizza or pop and what are you hoping for from the university chapters so that's much more disruptive [COHESIVE_GOALS: we want to challenge the status quo head-on and do everything we possibly can to try to change the trajectory of our organ of our generation] and so our organization offers that in a lot of different ways whether it be offering guest speakers on campus such as myself so this last week I spoke at the University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles UC Berkeley and UCLA one day after the other we had a packed house every seat filled we had a lot of protesters a lot of opposition hundreds of thousands of people watched the live stream the live stream will hit a million people on kind of going retroactive views happening right now throughout this next week and you said you were there with Ruben that's correct I was there with Dave Ruben and Candace Owens so Candace Owens works for us she's our communications director oh okay yeah so Candace is a superstar in fact she just got a nice shout out from Kanye West saying I love the way Candace Owens thinks which honestly is a it's hard to even put into words the significance of a rap artist like him singling out a conservative minded pundit like Candace I think there's a [HOPE: seismic shift happening in America in the black community that is gonna be a generational ideological civil war] in the words of Candace Owens so we went to UC Berkeley and UCLA and what's interesting about Candace Owens is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: she uses identity politics against the left] and so [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: truth is truth should be colorblind and any individual should be able to say what they want to say despite their skin color or their gender] unfortunately it's not the case in a college campus so I'll say something it might trigger the audience but Candace will say that and they're perfectly okay with that and that shouldn't be the case but that just shows how but it must be harder for her on the contrary side to be conservative and black without a doubt and [ENMITY: the the societal punishment she receives for that is horrific] like what what's happening well the things that they I mean the words they call her I wouldn't even repeat on camera but you know the nice ones are Uncle Tom right you know Coon things of that nature she has a very just the harsh backlash for what she believes in what she feels because [ENMITY: how dare she stray away from the ideological monopoly that the left has on the black community] and for those that people that don't know that might be watching internationally the Democrat Party receives 96 the 97% of all black voters in America despite the Democrat policies having the worst impact on the black community and so [COHESIVE_GOALS: Candace is trying to wake up that community and so we're happy to have her as our communications director and help enhance her her her vision to try to at least get people to think differently]. Yeah I'm gonna talk to Warren Farrell later today and he just wrote a book called The Boy Crisis and in there he talks a fair bit about the pernicious effect of fatherlessness and that's something that I'm very interested in in in Ontario we have as part of standard political policy that all families are equal you know and the idea there is that respect should be given to familial units regardless of their structure and you know there's something to be said for that because people have to struggle through life the best they can whether they're single parents or or regardless of how they put their family together but [FEAR: the empirical data on the catastrophe of fatherlessness is extraordinarily solid and deep and it seems to be something in principle that's a particular plague for the black community]. That's correct. And I guess I'm wondering too like with the conservative approach to that are are have you guys focused on the problems of fatherlessness and what's your take on that? Oh and without a doubt [FEAR: if I had a pinpoint one societal trend that has harmed the black community most would be the rise of single motherhood in the US] so to give a number just to so people understand the single motherhood rate in the 1960s is about 18% in the black community now it's 77% 77% of US blacks will grow up never knowing their father [FEAR: There is no there's no rational argument that that is healthy for a society] and the reason for that. There's an article in the Atlantic Monthly just two weeks ago showing that which is which is not notable right because it's not like the Atlantic is a right-leaning magazine. Anything but. Yeah yeah and you know I mean they can be even handed when they're at their best and they reviewed the new evidence that was presented in this research paper which I also read showing that if you look at those few locales where poor black people and poor white people do approximately as well if you track them over a reasonable amount of time [MUDITA: the the thing that characterizes the high functioning poorer poorer places is the presence of fathers]. That's exactly right. And they said that not only the researchers claim that not only was that good in the immediate family so to have your father around but in neighborhoods where having fathers around is the norm every boy in particular does better in the neighborhoods. That's right and every crime goes down the likelihood of not going to prison obviously goes down but the interesting question is we have to ask why so we as a conservators always try to ask what is the reason this is happening and whereas the left I don't always think they go through that or they ignore it willingly the reason is because the great society that was passed by Lyndon Baines Johnson in the 1960s where the US government literally subsidized single motherhood where if you got married you lost your government check and it still exists to this day in the states where the idea and the intention was well let's try to help single mothers. Okay that's fine I don't think anyone doesn't doesn't want to help single mothers [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the problem is as soon as you get married you lose that check because it was a program designed for single motherhood and so when you incentivize bad behavior you get more of it] and that's exactly what you've seen in the states you couple that with a disastrous public education system run by public sector teacher unions that have no accountability protected by tenure and really embrace mediocrity its highest form with failing urban cities with Democrat mayors that have no grasp of free enterprise or how to properly run any sort of organization let alone a massive municipality or city that's why [FEAR: you have the black community failing so much] the final point I'll say is this in the states the two poorest communities by race if you will are the two communities that receive the most government assistance per capita the Native American community and the African American community and so [FEAR: we can draw a direct correlation and distinction between the rise the welfare state in America and actually the decline of the black community in the Native American community] and but the solution of that is black fathers and so we always say black fathers matter well there seems to be an employment issue too and I mean that's a complicated problem because you know that the employment market for people who are less skilled has has been I would say in decline especially on the male end of the distribution and one of the stats that feral sites is that three-quarters of women will not consider seriously dating an unemployed man whereas one-third of men would have a problem dating an unemployed woman so there's obviously a gender bias there and I think there's a reason for that I think that it's grounded in it's grounded in both rationality and evolutionary biology the evolutionary biology element is that women across cultures tend to mate across and up hierarchies let's say that's right and the reason for that I think is that they're logically and this is where the logic comes in as well as the biology they're looking for a partner that can be of substantial economic utility practical utility when they put themselves in the vulnerable position of having a child so then you also have this additional problem is if the employment situation tanks in any serious way then men become less desirable as partners and your claim I guess in part is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: by filling that void the government actually contributes to the problem rather than than addressing it] exactly and that's tied in I suppose too with the rates of incarceration for black people in the United States and [FEAR: you have a negative feedback loop where you get more of that bad behavior] so the black fathers go to prison so they're not there to raise the kids the kids go to gangs so they'll end up either dead in prison hopeless or completely directionless the black single mothers who want to continue to do what's right for the community they have a cut they're left with very few choices have more kids right right so [FEAR: it's a negative feedback loop so you have you have bad behavior reinforcing more bad behavior subsidized by the government] then you have the complete destruction of what used to be a somewhat you know civilized portion of American life which if you look at the worst areas in America it's the inner cities predominantly with the African-American community and so the final the interesting point is how on earth is it that black people today their grandfathers lived a better life than their fathers was America is America more racist today than it was in the 1960s absolutely not America's become significantly less racist but if you look to the American left or the social justice warriors the academic and the neo-Marxist [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they pinpoint racism as the significant driving force to why black people are doing poorly in America] and that's yeah well that's a that's a problem too that I've talked about with regards to gender inequality and pay it's like which you've been wonderful on yeah well there's a lot of different reasons for difference if you analyze differences in important attributes by group whatever your group measure is you're going to find that there's a dozen contributors you know just to pick a multivariate analysis to use your quote yeah well and the thing is is that you can that you can attribute a certain amount of the difference in success between groups to let's call it racial attitudes or ethnocentrism on the part of the dominant group it's complicated because in the US Asians do the best spectacularly well Jews do well Nigerians do pretty damn well black immigrants do quite well that's correct so so it's much more complex than a simple racial analysis would indicate and the problem I guess in part with the group fostered analysis is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: people make the claim that a single factor prejudice essentially is the cause of all the problems] and then that has the additionally pernicious effect of blanketing everyone who isn't in the oppressed group this being spoken for at the moment as oppressors and also and this is an even more pernicious element and I really believe that this is part of the fundamental motivation of the [ENMITY: pathological left] is that [ENVY: there's a war on the idea of competence itself] you know because [ENVY: if you take someone who's worked hard and and being productive and being useful and admirable in all the ways that you might hope someone was and then you tell them that the only reason that they've been successful is because of their skin color let's say and the systemic racism that characterizes the society then what you do is undermine the entire idea that competence itself might be the basis of a hierarchy] and that way and I really think that that desire to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: undermine the idea that hierarchies can be based on competence] is associated with the deep Marxism that's associated with the radical left and I can't think of an idea that's more pernicious than that. That's right and I have to tell you Jordan as you know I've been doing this not for a long time but I've been doing it for at least in you know equivalent you know six years of college activism and organizing and your video on postmodernism and neo-Marxism I remember exactly where I was I was driving to the University of Michigan just a couple months ago and I literally in my car I said I finally get it I finally understand what is motivating these people the philosophy behind it and it was an hour and a half video where you really dissected postmodernism and it's exactly what you just said [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they want the death of the individual the death of logos that any sort of success can be attributed to some sort of arbitrary prejudice] that's exactly right [ENVY: the equation of success and I just I could I can't explain to you how significant that was] well I also think that's tied in with what you might describe as the let's say the decline of boys assuming that that sort of thing is is reasonable if you tell boys that the paid first of all that society is a patriarchy which it isn't if you tell them that and then you say well not only is it a patriarchy it's a corrupt patriarchy it's a corrupt destructive racist prejudice patriarchy and that anyone who succeeds in it is therefore corrupt prejudice and racist because that's how you would succeed in a hierarchy like that then what you do is you associate in the minds of people who might participate in the project the idea that [ENVY: any success whatsoever is actually a moral flaw] and I've seen that happen to lots of people I had a friend in particular who bought that line and he had other problems as well but he really believed that active engagement with the world any pursuit of success on his part for him and for his family and for his community but let's say for him to begin with was merely was merely engagement in the process by which [FEAR: the entire world is being destroyed and brought to his to its knees] he really believed that and it really many things destroyed him but that was certainly one of the things that destroyed him and you know there's no differentiation in history is obviously a bloody nightmare and there's no way around that but [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's necessary to differentiate between activity that is good and activity that is evil] and to state that all activity that supports the patriarch in God I can't stand it that we even have to use that language it's but it's it is more widespread on universities than people realize you understand it but for most parents there is a [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: concerted effort to delegitimize and I would say destroy the idea of the white Christian male] in you know North American schools especially the male aspect of it we're taught from the beginning stages that [ENVY: there is a patriarchy it's rigged against women] when in reality the numbers show men are far more likely to commit suicide men are not living as long as women men are much more likely to go to prison much more likely to declare bankruptcy much more likely to be killed at work that's exactly right women are graduating in college and record numbers women 14 less 15 years have dominated in the math I've got more master degrees and more PhDs than men and there's another interesting stat too that you never hear discussed by feminists and it actually drives me it's one of the many things that drives me to distraction let's say is that men let's accept for a moment that all that on average men make more money than women although the reasons for that as we've already discussed or extraordinarily complicated women spend the last time I looked something approximating 75 to 80 percent of the consumer dollar and you can make a real at least you can pose it as a question it's like well who has the economic upper hand is it the person who makes the money or is it the person who spends the money and I think that's a real question because most of the men that I know that are worse their salt it's like the competitive guys often they're out for money because that's the way they keep score the competition you really see that in places like law firms where everyone's heavily competitive and they're always they always have an eye on the bonus because they're trying to climb up the hierarchy and in large part from a biological perspective that's actually to make them attractive to women so but if the if men are men are motivated to earn heavily to be attractive in part which is certainly part of it and to take their place in the male hierarchy and and to succeed there then it also means that a huge part of their motivation is to distribute the money and you know and to distribute it to who well at least in principle to their wife and their kids and I mean if you if you're a man of any utility and you meet another man who's fundamentally oriented in a selfish direction who's hoarding his money without any concern for how it might be utilized who's spending it all on let's call them juvenile adolescent impulsive pleasures refusing to share it's not like that someone that you admire it's someone you have contempt for right away and so if you ever meet someone who's like the stereotype of the successful patriarchal male then he's not somebody that fills you with admiration you're looking for someone who and [MUDITA: the people I know that have been successful financially that I've admired and there's been many of them have done amazing things they've produced technologies that are world-changing often] you know and but they're hyper concerned with what it is that they're going to do with their money and how it should be well spent and where it would do the most good and I don't want to whitewash I don't want to whitewash our society but the idea that people are fundamentally motivated by the sorts of selfish motivations that only accrue benefit to them and no one else is it's a preposterous claim and I just don't see any evidence whatsoever that that's the case I agree and one of the other components of it that is taught in our schools which one of the top things I have to dispel is [ENVY: the idea that just because someone gets rich someone got poor is the zero-sum game] and so [ENVY: there's an idea that has penetrated the minds of youth in America that I can't believe it's like oh this guy has a million bucks he must have stole it from someone else wrong] [MUDITA: you had to create value in order to get that money in fact] or at least some people do that like you could say and should say that you know in every hierarchical enterprise of any scale there's going to be a fractional criminal element without a doubt maybe you could say well it's five percent of the sum total of the activity and the problem with the criminal part of it is that it tends not to be very self-sustaining you know so you hear well there's lots of psychopaths in business it's like yeah but they get it out they get pushed out they do and they otherwise they have to move from place to place because their reputations follow them around and your reputation is actually quite fragile and so you could say well amongst the pool of people who are wealthy there's an element that have obtained that wealth through means that aren't admirable for reasons that aren't socially beneficial but to then and say then say because of that existence of that small fraction of people which is actually in eradicable right you can't have a certain amount of freedom without a certain amount of criminality I think the America is a really good example of that to say that that means that [ENVY: everyone who's been successful is a thief] it's like you have to be very careful when you make a claim like that because it also means that if you're successful then you're a thief that's a hell of a value structure to adopt and I would make the argument that [MUDITA: the mark the free market system forces you to be a better person it forces you to tell the truth and create a better product and treat your customers well and to be responsive when something goes wrong or to lower your price or to improve the mechanism of which you are interacting with the well it's not like customers aren't demanding and that they don't have choice] you know and that's another that's another example of a different kind of cognitive problem let's say is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: people are taught people aren't taught that comparing what we have to their hypothetical politically ideologically motivated utopia is actually a bad idea] you know because it's it just isn't difficult to take a look at a system like our system and say well look at all the problems it has compared to a hypothetical system that doesn't have any problems at all it's like well yeah man there's problems there's you know we've we've taken like 99% of the fish out of the ocean and and you know the degree to which our current level of economic activity is truly sustainable without alteration is at least debatable even though I don't think it's nearly as terrible as people make out make it out to be but [HOPE: I don't think it's disputable that our current socioeconomic structures are the most productive and the most free structures that have ever been produced by people anywhere in the world] and [MUDITA: one of the things you can say about capitalism and free enterprise and and the Western stress on individuality is that even though it does produce inequality a all systems produce inequality] and and without any real distinction between the right and the left by the way because it's a new book called the great leveler by Walter Scheidel who I'm going to be talking to later this month he did an analysis empirical analysis trying to figure out if you if you grouped governments by right-wing philosophy say or by left-wing philosophy and then you calculated inequality coefficient would the left-wing organizations be characterized by reduced inequality and the answer was no there's no evidence that they are and what that points to and this is something very fundamental it's even it's far more fundamental than than political is that inequality is the rule in cooperative slash competitive organizations you can't positive value without producing a hierarchy right because you positive value say this is worth doing everyone says yeah this is worth doing well then what happens automatically is that some people are better at doing it than other people no matter what it is when they get better and better at it like the way to principle you talk about to and then they start getting better at it so the problem is is that without you with if you're going to positive value which you have to do if you're going to act and immediately you create a hierarchy and you also build into the value claim the claim that a is better than b you also build into that the idea that if a is better than b then [MUDITA: people who are doing better at a should be differentially rewarded compared to people who aren't] there's no way around that if you're going to play the game and so in it you're stuck with inequality but there isn't any evidence that that social engineering policies are really very good at dispensing with inequality which is a fundamental political problem and no one really knows what to do about it but [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: criticizing the entire society] I mean the thing about the West and this is increasingly true all over the world is that [HOPE: it's generating our approach generates a tremendous amount of wealth] for I mean it even happened in China you know despite their exceptionally totalitarian leanings and so you what happens with the lefties is that [ENVY: they say well inequality is a consequence of the West and a consequence of capitalism which is a palpably false claim and say well because it produces inequality then it's a corrupt system] it's like no every system produces inequality but [MUDITA: hardly any also produce wealth that's correct in mobility and and reward for creativity entrepreneurial activity and risk taken] that's that's something that the the free market system is quite unique at and whereas a more neo-mark system view how do you get rich and a socialist you run for a political office that's true exploitation is you run on the best intentions of the public while implementing what you believe to be the best socially engineered construct [FEAR: look at Venezuela I mean the leaders are doing just fine meanwhile people are dying oh yeah there is a complete catastrophe 13,000% inflation so on and so forth] so I have a question for you and and I've watched hundreds of hours of your content on the internet you've opened up my mind in ways I cannot describe you've made me a better speaker you've made me a better lecture a better person more organized more I can draw direct corollary to our organization's budget and everything from when I first interacted with your content because I had never heard anyone describe the reality of life [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: life is suffering what are you gonna do about it it's just so bluntly and so directly but with struggle up the damn that's exactly right with a roadmap to deal with that] because and I'll tell you something cool and then I'll give you a question okay no no no no no no problem we have this program and it might be something the future offer your organization yeah I've used it with people have that with drug huh huh well we we have a fairly new study that came out last year from Mohawk College which is a junior college with a vocational element and the kids came in during the summer in their orientation and spent just an hour writing out their life plan right how how they what they would like to have in their life across six standard dimensions intimate relationship family education care of their own mental and physical health strategies for dealing with temptation like drug and alcohol use useful application of their time outside of out of outside of their obligations so the question is it's like it's it's it's sort of predicated on a New Testament principle I would say in part which is you know if you could have what you wanted by asking what what would you ask asking you shall receive exactly knock knock and you will answer right exactly in Matthew yeah exactly it's in Matthew and and the idea there I think from a psychological perspective is is that while you're not going to get what you want unless you know what it is and you're not going to target unless you aim for it course and you can't even organize your perceptions in relationship to the world unless you have a goal okay so you write down what you think you might want and need in order to stand your life and then you write for a while about how what your life could be like in three to five years if if you put your if you what what your vision would be for your life three to five years and then you write a counter vision which is an analysis of where you might be in three to five years if you let all your bad habits take the upper hand and then you write a plan okay and it takes a long time to do a really good job of that but it turns out that you can do a bad job of it in about an hour and so we had the kids at Mohawk do it for an hour when they came in for their summer orientation and [HOPE: it knocked the dropout rate for young men down 50%] and so I thought it just just blew me away because it's sad you know I thought just look at that if you get young guys to sit down and think for an hour about what they would like their life to be it decreases the probability that they'll drop out of college by 50% it's like what the hell man kind of correlation it's just stunning what's and we have three studies demonstrate that was the biggest I've seen it I I'm dealing currently with one of my best high school buddies that was on opioids it's a huge problem in America yeah and I'm guessing here in Canada it is as well I'm not as well versed in it and I sat him down and I did the future authoring program and it changed his life and you know and I made him watch all your videos and yeah he came hooked on it and it saved no be it's probably well yeah you saved his life I can say that and you changed my life I wouldn't say you say because I wasn't in that same dire condition but the number one thing I said to him I said listen buddy I'm not gonna use his name to protect his privacy I said your whole life you've been seeking freedom he's like yeah that's whatever I've been told I said things in life that give you meaning will come from responsibility and that's that's what clicked one of the things that you said that really clicked with me yeah that's a good thing to know man [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have inundated especially young men yeah go seek freedom go do what you want how you want to do it when you want to do which is fine there's nothing inherently wrong to that when you're young but if you really want meaning if you want satisfaction if you want direction it's the stuff that has consequence it's family work that's exactly right freedom is freedom we're not teaching young men that no intentionally that's the other thing I wanted to get to but go right I think it's intentional] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I think it is too because it's part and parcel of the idea that the productive activity of young men and this also goes for the masculine symbolically masculine activity of young women by the way but the productive activity of young men is indistinguishable from the force that gives rise to the to the crushing tyranny of the patriarchy] it's like well and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: that also gives young men a moral excuse not to engage in life] it's like well you know productive activity I see it all the time I've been told them a horrible person my whole life what use is this to me I'm gonna go play video games in my basement yeah [ENVY: I've been told from all my teachers my parents that you know it's rigged you know that I'm a horrible individual just because I'm a man] and it really diminishes a men that might want to succeed and I see it happen all the time yeah [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: well it gives an excuse to the useless part of men that don't want to succeed] because it's easy to sit around I mean it isn't because of the long-term consequences of that are just absolutely devastating yes but you see so when we have a discussion about freedom you know we might also say well the freedom is I think this is right is for its freedom to pick your poison it's freedom to pick your responsibility that's you might say well that there's there's a set of weights in front of you that you have to pick up in order to stand yourself because that's the other thing I think about human beings well you know [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we conscientiousness is a trait and it we don't have an animal model for conscientiousness in fact we don't understand conscientiousness at all from from from a psychological or Darwinian perspective] well that's that's more complicated because conscientious men tend to do better and so they're going to be more successful but but we don't have a model for what conscientiousness is but but conscientiousness is at least in part this the the necessity to carry a load for yourself and for other people or to suffer guilt and shame as a consequence and so that's that seems built in especially to conscientious people now conscientious people tend more tend to be more conservative because that's one of the predictors of conservatism but it could easily be that freedom is the freedom to choose your yoke let's say and and then you choose the weight that you have to carry so that you can justify your miserable existence to yourself so that you can go to bed at the end of the night and you can think look I I did what I needed to do to set things right today and I don't have to carry the existential weight around of my failure and uselessness as a consequence the existential psychologists in the 1950s who emerged out of the chaos of World War two were very much very much concentrated on the idea of existential guilt you know that you owed you owed being a ransom for your existence and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the way that you paid that ransom was to work for the betterment of being] I mean it's a very ancient idea but of course but it is the one idea I think that gives people the self-respect not self-esteem the self-respect that's necessary to carry them through terrible times and to use a story that people are familiar with when I'm asked what what is Jordan Peterson done for your members of people you know I say he hasn't stopped acting like Peter Pan hmm so I think they can actually be a man and not a boy the Peter Pan story is really interesting one a because Peter Pan Pan means everything right technically that's what Pan means and Peter Pan wants to be a child because a child can be anything can be everything right so what you have in childhood is that a plethora of potential and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the problem with growing up is that you have to sacrifice that that Pan potential for a defined actuality right that's that's that's to grow up and become something instead of staying potentially anything] now the problem with Peter Pan is that he looks into the world and and sees Captain Hook as his role model right and so that's his model for for adulthood and hook is terrified of death that's the crocodile is chasing him with a clock in his stomach and the crocodile already has a piece of him it's got a taste of him and so hook is constantly chased by the dragon of chaos essentially that's already got a taste of him and because hook is terrified of his own mortality and terrified in general he's a tyrant and so Pan looks at hook and says well if that's adulthood I'd rather stay king of the lost boys that's exactly right and so yeah and it's a very powerful story well which is why people still tell it a hundred years later that's correct but [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: what I see at least from my experience is that the idea of staying a boy is idolized and is more culturally acceptable in America than ever has been] and it's almost as if that you ask a young man that is generally on the direction towards hopelessness and just kind of what you bring men out of it is they look towards that MTV VH1 lifestyle of being able to do whatever you want to do how you want to do it get extraordinarily drunk have no responsibility be with women all day long what happens you do that for a couple years you end up a horribly miserable person and so but here's my question is yeah you don't want to be the oldest guy at the front party no that's correct but that's pretty dismal but it's here's my here's my distinction though is that in some ways it's the women that are embracing the masculine archetype in some ways that are being successful I mean they're they're being extraordinarily responsible and they're they're feeling a lot of these positions quicker than men can I mean they're and they're graduating in higher rates of college and they're declining they're declining motherhood or they're at least suspending it throughout the West which is you could argue for either ways there's reasons for that but I guess my question is I think that the expression of the masculine spirit in women isn't denigrated like [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: women don't get accused of contributing to the patriarchy even when they take positions in society that you would think are fully patriarchal] you know and which is a strange thing so women who go to law school and then practice as corporate lawyers say aren't subject to the same what would you call it claim that their activity is facilitating the decline of the planet yes I guess because they're seen as well there because of their gender I suppose they're seen as as leaders of the rebellion against the patriarchal spirit even though structurally it boils down to the same thing sure so that masculine classically masculine symbolically masculine yearning for hierarchical productivity and competition is rewarded in women but not in men and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: which is also a very perverse thing because it doesn't make any sense it makes sense through the post-modernist view which is they're just undoing the oppressorship of the man in the last hundred fifty years so the ends justify the means that's the way they look at it whatever power women can take from men is a good thing that's the way they look at it] well there's a funny thing about that too that I reviewed this in 12 rules for life I was looking at some of the Pew research data and I don't remember the figures precisely but over the last 15 years the percentage of women who young women who claim that they would like to be married in a permanent relationship has gone up a substantial amount I don't remember what it was a 50% approximately springs to mind but a lot at the same time it's declined almost the same degree among young men and so what's what's perverse about this this is something I've talked to my daughter a fair bit about is that I mean if you ask young women what they want I don't know if they can answer because I don't know if they know if they're 19 or 20 because I think their heads are so muddled by what they've been told that they don't really know that's got my sense is that women want the opportunity to develop their career in whatever direction they see fit and fair enough but they want an intimate relationship and usually a monogamous one that's permanent and they want to have the opportunity to have kids and what you see happening inevitably and I believe this to be the case I've watched very carefully as I've grown up and got older because I've worked with women my whole life is that [COHESIVE_GOALS: women are less compelled by their career as they approach their 30s and more compelled by the desire to have a permanent relationship as a family biological to I would argue to] well I mean I I I think it's it's a biological necessity because women have to have children relatively young that's correct but it's interesting to watch it phenomenologically and even the women that I've seen who've had very high power careers is that as they move into their especially their early 30s they start to realize that the career is a pretty one-dimensional enterprise even if it's a good career because even good careers are still jobs and good careers are also very hard jobs they're like 70 hour a week jobs and their full bore commitment jobs and to figure out how to have a career like that and to have a life to have a family to have an intimate relationship to have children and then to also be able to take care of them that's a very complex that's a very complex job to manage and so what's strange is I think what's strange is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the very things that the radicals are undermining like the monogamous family are actually those things that women most want especially as they approach their 30s] and so [FEAR: this is a catastrophe on both ends of the of the gender distribution] so if there's one thing I would love to get your opinion and take on is and I deal with these college radicals is the at least the professors the people that should know better of the roots of Western civilization the only description that I could give to their motivation is [ENMITY: some people just want to see the world burn] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's almost as if they want chaos for the sake that they were not able to contribute meaning] me I would love your take on that from a social law about this and I thought about it what is their intention what is well the question is to some degree what's the intention of [ENVY: resentment and failure] yes that's correct look let's say that you let's say that you everything hasn't turned out for you the way you want it and you're angry about that and [ENVY: maybe you're angry about the people who have been successful because they cast you in a dim light] and so [ENVY: there's the anger that motivates the desire for destruction that's resentment] right and you never want to estimate evil try right you know greed envy and resentment something something like that's correct yeah it's arrogance deceit and resentment that's that's a bad tryout that'll take you down and the thing about the thing so there's anger and maybe you in the anger you want everything to burn but there's also the idea too that and this is part of the reason that inequality actually is a problem for people on the right on and on the left is that [FEAR: if you put people in a position where they don't have what they need and want and they can't see a way to get it they have high motivation to flip the game board over and start again or maybe to try to play a new game] and so part of the reason that those on the right for example have to be careful not only to raise wealth overall but also to be careful about inequality is that as society has become more unequal the motivation for those who feel dispossessed to flip the entire game over grows and grows quite rapidly and I see that sort of resentment in the universities although it's to some degree it's difficult to say why because of course university professors aren't unsuccessful by any stretch of the imagination well compensated and they're very they're very secure positions but but there's still an anti-capitalist ethos that runs through the universities that's difficult to make a to make a case for is it is it and this is what I try to figure out is it that I know better than you sort of thing and you deal with these professors is it that I'm a smarter individual and [ENVY: I we can create society more equitably] yeah it's partly that it's a hubris right yeah that's partly that the rational is to cubris yeah absolutely that you know that you can systematize utopia and that you're smart enough to do that I have a doctorate I could figure this stuff out so well and that your systematizing of utopia isn't going to generate unexpected consequences now you know social scientists should be much smarter than that because if you're a social scientist who has any sense what you learn from your research is that the probability that you can predict the outcome of your procedure which is what you're trying to do as a scientist is very low you run an experiment predicated on a hypothesis you put the procedure in place that's supposed to put supposed to produce the hypothesized outcome and likely is not it doesn't and those are that's under simple conditions in the lab where you can control almost everything and then there's also the case that and and this has been well known among good social scientists for a long time is that [FEAR: large-scale social engineering projects almost never produced the results there in that are intended] they because systems are very complex and you tweak one thing and you think you're only tweaking one thing but you're tweaking 20 things and a lot of the things that you tweak inadvertently kick back and variants of that too yeah yeah so it's a it's a hard thing to because I get this question a lot from because this is all I deal with I deal with the leftist activists and the social justice mind and two things that are so important the activists are taking over governments now and at a rapid rate [FEAR: the Democrat Party in America has been taken over by the social justice neo-Marxist postmodernist left and that it's extraordinarily dangerous to the West] and but I'm always I'm always asked by people what motivates them because [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's so damn obvious the ideas that they're trying to advance don't work] I mean we have a plethora of [FEAR: we have a century of evidence that central planning will weaken societies will cause civilization chaos will not create wealth will cause debt] so what's still not a big step I think part of it is just it's actually complexity it's like I've been thinking about this and it's it's relatively straightforward to identify pathology on the right I think and basically you you look at claims of racial superiority and the right-wing identity politics types who are making claims of racial superiority everyone says well you know you're wandering down the Nazi pathway and that's unacceptable and virtually everyone you know 99% of people agree that that's a bad idea but on the left the problem is is that it's clear that some concatenation of leftist policies when taken to extreme produce a catastrophe right we've got it but it's not just the economic it's the cultural too well absolutely but the problem is it's not that easy to point to which policies you know so if you read the gulag archipelago for example solzhenitsyn's work on sure I have prison camp system he does a really good job of detailing out the relationship between the utopian policies of the Leninists and the catastrophes that occurred but it's not simple you can't point to one thing and you say oh well that's like a racial superiority or it's because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: well we want to foster inclusion of oppressed groups who could be against that all right right] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we want to we want to level the playing field] we'll go okay yeah well exactly and so in isolation each of these ideas not only sounds plausible but sounds positively beneficial but the problem is that you put a number of them together and [FEAR: somehow things tilt in a direction that's really really terrible] but isn't it this is this is the other part of it that I try to dive into I ask when I do my speeches on campuses I ask a series of five questions and one of the first question is are people good or bad by nature and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the neo-Marxists will get in front of a mic and I have these videos that have 10 15 million views where they'll try to argue me that that argue to me that people are good by nature it's just the social construct that makes them bad] that's one of the big problems here it is definitely but and you're the expert here I mean you've been doing this for you know decades and you have plethora of research my argument is always well then why do we have to teach goodness to our youth why do we have to tell young people to stop crying why do young people pit their parents against each other they were there ever taught that behavior of course not even aggression like the evidence that aggression is innate is I think it's over well I don't think it's overwhelming look at the conclusive we evolve from chimpanzees they go to war right I mean but but but that's that that's one of the key things is how did the neo-Marxists find any sort of you know any sort of intellectual consistency with believing that and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they teach young people that that this is all just a flawed social construct but we're actually good people by nature not aggressive we're not prejudiced in any sense] it's a compelling story because it's half the true you know I mean part of the reason that human endeavor is pathologized is because there's a tyrannical element to social organization sure and so you can say well people are basically good and culture makes them bad and you can tell a good story using those axioms I mean you can reverse it you can say no people are basically like uncivilized and barbaric as individuals and that only society makes them good to the degree that they're good that's the difference between Hobbes and Rousseau right because Rousseau would argue for the former and Hobbes for the latter and you can make a very strong case for both and because the case is compelling you don't necessarily hear the other side of the story sure so and that's that's the thing about ideologies is that they tend to tell half the story in a compelling way and I mean it's also kind of a nice story if you're a naive person because you think well I'm a good person and everybody else I know is good that even must come from somewhere so it's really interesting you say that so we are at UCLA and this is a very interesting thing and [ENMITY: there was a black woman that said Candacellans I think you're a white supremacist of course another black woman] and I asked her I said wait a second are you a racist are you a racist no I'm not then where's the line where does one stop becoming a racist because you're not of course right you wouldn't be saying this if you weren't so what do I have to do to be more like you it's like [ENVY: everyone else is a horrible person except me] yeah you know it's that kind of narcissism self-centeredness there's a great quote by Dennis Prager where he said growing up in the 1970s and 80s we taught our youth that they were the problem in America was a good thing now it's the exact opposite now it's that America's the problem and you're the greatest thing ever one of the most impactful analysis you ever made was kind of something Carl Jung said is you know [AMITY: treat others the way you want to be treated but that you don't always want to be treated with you know ubiquitous love and kindness you want to be sometimes have discipline lots and want that] lot I mean one of the things I've learned as a clinician well and as as a private person for that matter is that we outsource our sanity you know the psychoanalysts believed and most psychologists believe that your sanity is sort of something you carry around in your in your ego in your head and if you're saying it's because you're your psyche is well structured but that's actually not true it's true to some degree but but what's more true is that the way you stay sane is by knowing how to behave in a manner that makes you sufficiently acceptable so that other people will put up with you and then you surround yourself with other people and hopefully they're doing reasonably well and every time you do something stupid they slap you on the side of the head you know either fairly gruffly or subtly by raising an eyebrow or failing to listen to you or not not phoning you to go out for a beer on Friday night because then you change your behavior a little bit or you reflect you say we have to do something different well and you if you're lucky you have 20 people around you that are always tapping you and telling you when you're funny and witty and interesting and when you're boring and stupid you do more of that or less right right and so so you so this the social structure plays a key role in maintaining individual sanity there's no doubt about that so I want to switch this a little bit I want to get back to some things that are more specific to you so let's talk about your plans for your organization over the next couple of years and your goals you know because a critic might say well you know you're complaining about activism on the left but here you are engaging in activism and who cares if it's on the right or the left it's still activism and that carries with it all the problems of activism so I'd like you to address that but also then to say where you're headed and and how you expect to get there and why sure so at first I would say [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have to reclaim the term activism activism for the right ideas is virtuous and correct and always has been I think throughout western civilization] and we're on the side now [COHESIVE_GOALS: we're fighting for intellectual and ideological diversity and free speech] now activism does not necessarily mean you have to storm the president's office or defy you know the rules that be but [COHESIVE_GOALS: it does mean you try to be disruptive on campus wherever mean necessary as long as you're not doing what the left does which is trying to suppress someone else's rights to speech or try to you know destroy private property] so I'll give you a great example me going to UC Berkeley with Dave Ruman and Candace Owens that's a form of activism we were welcomed by our group there on campus and the young republican group but there was petitions trying to get us off campus [ENMITY: there was immense hostility the administration did not want us there] we had to pay thousands of dollars for security fees and for police yeah that whole security fee thing that's pretty that's extraordinarily cumbersome well and it intentionally so underhanded absolutely it's so unbelievably underhanded and so there's some there's an interesting distinction here that I want to I want to make and I'd love to get your analysis I don't want to deviate too much from your question but for doing this for the years I've done this almost daily one of our groups will get disinvited from campus have their funding cut well I will get shouted down fire alarms poles windows smashed daily conservatives will try to get disinvited from campus [AMITY: I've never once seen a conservative student a student group a conservative group or conservative professor try to disinvite or try to prevent a liberal from coming on campus not once] so you have here [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the left being the predominant political viewpoint on college campuses a monopoly yet they do everything they can to prevent anyone else from challenging that viewpoint] and we conservatives are in the political minority and [AMITY: we perfectly allow the free discussion free flow of ideas] so to answer your question at least from the activism standpoint if someone would be a critic and they say well trial you're just doing the left is doing no [AMITY: I will defend a socialist's right to be wrong to the death I think that free speech and dialogue discussion is is the solution] well I do think too that [AMITY: marketplace of ideas civil behavior is unbelievably useful] you know one of the things that I've experienced over the last couple of years is that if I keep my head and I stay reasonable in the face of provocation which can be very severe at times fire alarms being pulled and people blowing air horns you know a foot away from me and and getting in my face in a serious way as I'm leaving places that I've been speaking and carrying a garot which is you know really pushing it a bit too far as far as I'm concerned and pounding on windows and doors and you're barricading sure yeah well it's primal a [COHESIVE_GOALS: good thing to really teach your your participants is that they're to remain civil and not to engage in acts that discredit them regardless of the provocation and that's no firearm alarm pulling that's no yelling people down civil dialogue and proper behavior and we win converts by doing that] and um and I'll send you a couple videos of and I've taken a cue from you the way you handled that BBC interview which one channel four yeah so I'm sorry yeah that's okay UK um it was extraordinary you had every right to pull her tongue out she was being just I mean it was almost impressively ignorant what she was doing yet you remain so calm and so in control and I think if you even though you had a right to do it if you would have went a little bit more towards the direction of abrasiveness or confrontational you wouldn't have been as effective I learned something you know and this is something that's worth knowing is that just because you're being attacked doesn't mean that's a bad thing you know like for now let's say that I go and and give a talk well two things can happen I can either give the talk and film that and put it on YouTube and then there's the advantages of that or I can go give the talk and be shouted down and by protesters like the ones at Queen's University I literally stormed the stage I saw the video and you handled it beautifully and then you said something like this is exactly you know why we're doing what we're doing or something well there's a couple of things the first thing is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's not such a terrible thing for people who are unreasonable to manifest their unreasonableness and then to have that publicized that's a good thing] we do a lot of it and the second thing is is that just so there's the event which would be the place that you're speaking but then that's not the event because all of this is filmed the event could easily be in the two months after it that's good and and so one of the ways that you can keep your head in this sort of situation is to understand that it isn't obvious when things are unfolding what's good and what isn't and if you well like that interview sure I mean my sense of the interview was that they were going to just cut it to five minutes which is what they broadcast and do everything they could to make me look like a fool you know but they put the whole thing up because they didn't have any idea what happened in that interview no one knew it's not like Channel 4 knew that that was a disaster and they put it up anyways they thought the interview went fine and then we're absolutely shocked by the public response but by that time it was too late to bring it down but my point is that it's a lot easier to keep your head if you don't jump to conclusions about what's happening in the moment being what's actually happening it's like [HOPE: it's a long game this it's not a short game] it's so interesting you say that so I went to the the anti-gun march in Washington DC and I went and challenged some of these anti-gun protesters and I had someone follow me around with a camera and I had four hours of discussions with people there was one discussion that I didn't even remember with a woman it was about second amendment rights we put it up nine and a half million views and I couldn't understand what it was and she was kind of getting very abrasive but she was saying such crazy things but I must have struck a chord and so interesting to say that that there's there's two realities and really there's one where you have it's how it's perceived when you're there how people feel it and how it sounds you know echolocation-wise and all that but also the people that watch it when you cut it up or the video afterwards which in some ways is even more powerful well it's it's it is more powerful period well this is also why I think it's so useful just to say what you think you know in a more fundamental way because [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: one of the ideas that has guided me in doing what I've been doing is that you want to let go of the consequences of your actions and say what you believe to be true] that doesn't mean you should be a fool about it or that you should say everything all the time but the reason that you this is this fundamental hallmark of faith I believe in faith in the truest sense is the belief that [HOPE: truthful speech redeems the world] and that's a weird faith because what that means is that let's say you say some things and you're doing your best to be truthful and you get in trouble you think oh my god that didn't work it's like actually you don't know whether or not it worked because you can't calculate the full consequences of your action and so it could be that it worked just fine but it was painful in the short term and lots of things that work fine are painful in the short term and so there is a leap of faith that has to be made and I think that the reason that the biblical corpus is so powerful in part is because it's predicated on the fundamental assumption that [HOPE: truthful speech turns the potential of reality the truth the truth tells that you free] well that which is which is who the hell would ever believe that right because that isn't what that isn't how it looks what it looks like is that the truth will get you in trouble of course but what happens is it gets you in trouble in the short term and and frees you in other people in the medium to long term and so okay so back to your plan sorry where are you headed of course so [COHESIVE_GOALS: the organization is is growing rather dramatically it's quite exciting so we have what's called vision 2020 we want to help move youth sentiment towards free enterprise and free speech kind of those general issues 20 points by 2020 so we're ramping up our organization dramatically] um to hopefully a 20 million dollar budget and the higher you know over 200 people across the states which will be a monumental accomplishment to be able to do this in the your field staffers these are organizers and in some ways my whole perspective from the very beginning I called ourselves the move on dot org or the right now move on dot org is a political social activism organization based in the states for far left wing causes I don't and to this day this is what drives our organization [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I don't think the left should have a monopoly on grassroots activism and they almost always have] um there's no reason for that lot the biggest is that [HOPE: we have a built-in counter-revolution brewing on our college campus as a students that are being punished for thinking differently and there is an organic uprising of students that are joining our organization attending our events you know implementing leadership positions in student government in other places] um because they're fed up they've had enough and I can't tell you well it would be really good if if for about 15 years it wasn't the most left-leaning radicals who controlled the student newspapers and the student unions it's been like that since I went to college back in the 1990s part of the programming we're implementing is [COHESIVE_GOALS: encouraging our students to run for student leadership on campus rather successfully] um and there's a lot there's a lot that we can show to actually change the campus culture and climate by doing so that that these student unions aren't divesting from fossil fuels fuels or saying there's no such thing as genders or [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: just astonishingly radical you know sentiments] and so as an organization more broadly um there's a lot of different ways we measure success things I could talk about publicly and things I can't talk about publicly um but [FEAR: we we are very concerned about the current trajectory of the west] and [FEAR: I believe and I said this many times I believe the greatest threat to western civilization is what's happening on American college campuses] um it's even more so than any other geopolitical foe it's more so than what's happening in washington dc because more than anything else [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you have a generation that has been inculcated to believe that america is a mistake everything about the west is wrong] well the thing is there america is a mistake and so is the west but compared to other mistakes it's pretty damn good like you said it's life is suffering it's it's finding the worst it's finding the best worst model that is possible and what's so divine I think about what the founding fathers realized is they said yeah people suck that systems get corrupted yeah civilizations are ruined things fall apart yeah essentially so [COHESIVE_GOALS: how do we decentralize that to the furthest extent so that we can have a hedge against the inevitability of human demands] I agree with you completely I do think that that was that's the fundamental stroke of genius it isn't how can we bring about utopia is [COHESIVE_GOALS: how can we design a system that idiots can't screw up too badly given that we're all idiots precisely] yeah yeah that's real wisdom and it's and it's it's wisdom it's real humility too it is it is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's real humility as well it means that you don't overreach yourself is that you're not presuming that you know enough to bring about heaven on earth but that maybe you can stave off the worst excesses of hell] that's right and what what what we teach our students and what's not taught in our schools is the american founding was the first political revolution where the victors voluntarily gave up political power right wash it could have been the washingtonian hamiltonian jeffersonian monarchy that ruled america for the next 200 years they would have done quite well rich and natural resources unaccompanied land that they could have took over but what was so amazing to them and their motivations I believe were pure is that they wanted to try something completely and totally different they did not want to embrace that which they rebelled against and as you said the humility for them to implement a system has been replicated all throughout the west I mean the idea of natural rights and decentralized government and democratic elections in a constitution republic [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's what built western civilization spain portugal france denmark they all have some form of that governance a little differences here and there] and but now [FEAR: that's being challenged that wealth of prosperity and standard of living increase and human rights accomplishments is now being in our university say no no that was this is all wrong this is all a racist homophobic bigoted construct designed to benefit white males it's a patriarch we must uproot the system] and so more broadly um [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we we are unbelievably privileged and blessed to live in western civilization even more specifically as an american i'm lucky to live in america and i'm going to fight every single day through the conduits and the vehicles that i've created to try to save this experiment] yeah [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: well i mean the the the the move that makes that something other than jingoistic patriotism is the move that says this is all good fortune and that and and that we should be grateful for that] and that our moral obligation is to sustain that to take up the responsibility necessary to sustain that and to improve it it's not ours by birthright not not by any means this is also why you know i'm i'm loath to this is why [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: i have trouble with right wing identitarianism because the right wing identitarians tend to take to themselves the positive attributes of their states without having to do the work necessary to place themselves among the people who are the actual founders] without a doubt so it's [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: identity politics of the right] yeah so all right so where can people learn more about your organization so that they can go to our website tpusa.com we have a massive conference coming up that i mentioned that we'd love to you know of course have you key note and your and i'll say that i don't know if i said this but if i repeat myself i apologize you know i've seen you save people's lives and you've changed my own and you're by far the most requested speaker and i guess the question i have for you in the time the short time we have remaining i guess is um have you have you seen any of this visibility or popularity or fame change you or at least change your pattern or your style of life or any of that no it's completely changed it in some ways how do you how do you keep order in this because it's chaotic isn't it i'm yeah very well i i from the master of order i have to ask sure you know so i have more and more people helping me all the time and [AMITY: we've been fortunate because we meaning my family because we've gone through this as a family we've been fortunate that people who have the expertise necessary to help us with this have showed up at opportune times] and i've have enough people around me with their eyes open to help me point myself in the right direction and avail myself of that help i would say what it's done to me personally mostly is just to make me more um careful because [FEAR: the costs of mistakes are while the cost of mistakes for me over the last two years have been incredibly high because people have been watching my every move including things that i've done in the past to see if there's any credible evidence that i'm any of the terrible things that people would like me to be] because [ENMITY: it's a pain in the neck for my leftist um opponents let's say if i'm not a brute] because then i have to be contended with seriously and so everything i've said and done has been gone over with a fine tooth comb and luckily so far that's worked out although you know that's grace of god and all that and so mostly it's made me more careful and more awake and more nervous all at the same time yeah i just i wanted to say that you've you've kept an unbelievable discipline of consistency throughout your career and what i always joke around fear will do that to you well in proper humility which you have and um if you read enough 20th century history and you actually try to understand that that'll make you humble enough well because you start thinking that if you have any sense and you read that history you don't read it as a victim and you don't read it as the person that would set things right [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: you read it as a perpetrator and you think oh yeah so that's what people that's what really that's what i'm like that's what really um again open my eyes one of the stuff you said is imagine being a prison guard in oschwitz worse imagine enjoying it though] that's right imagine benefiting from it right which which you would and you think you're such a good guy really you'd stand up to the ss if you were part of them and as you said [FEAR: the real evil of hitler is he didn't even use the utility of the jews he tried to kill more as his civilization was crushing around him that's sinister stuff i mean it would have made more sense to put in the work camps to make rifles and you know and bombs instead he tried to kill more of them anyway well that that does seem to indicate that the fundamental motivation was destruction regardless of the overlaying story which i think is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis] okay so let's say again the website sure it's uh tpusa.com so tpusa.com uh they can follow me on twitter uh charlie kerke 11 and um [COHESIVE_GOALS: we're we're fighting for the ideas that that created west] yeah well it would be nice you know to to think hard about how a couple of things that might be useful adjuncts and maybe you guys have thought this through to your organization is you know [COHESIVE_GOALS: there are places like the founder institute in california that are doing everything they can to start to help early stage entrepreneurs] and it might be really nice to make part of your um your message yes [COHESIVE_GOALS: the the necessity for the people who are part of your organization to to make a life plan to figure out how they're putting themselves together as individuals and to center the activism on that and then to say well you have to stand up and talk and speak whenever you're right to do that or your responsibility to do that is being interfered with but the fundamental thing that you have to concentrate on is putting your life in order that's that keeps the hubris at bay at least to some degree that's correct] and you have 1200 women coming together in june that's correct and that's in phoenix that's in dallas of course you have an open invite to everything and anything well that's cure that that'd be something well i'm interested in both of those you know i would like to i haven't spoken enough to young women i don't think well and we're doing a young men's summit i think next summer too i love the design around you but the young women is interesting i'll tell you why um i it is extraordinarily hard to be a young conservative on american college campus it is a multiple of difficult to be a young conservative woman there's an expectancy of leftism there is a hostility towards espousing any sort of conservative beliefs and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the gathering of young ladies together in this kind in a in a summit if you will which has grown dramatically at 300 800 and i will have 1200 has been so useful] and i'm a very firm believer in um gender segregated education at times and that's a horrible term you know what i mean essentially having women only events um there's something quite special that happens and same with men only events that's where the fraternity and sorority structure came across in north america so we'd love to have you maybe take a look at that um yeah well i'd that would be i'll do that we can stay in touch about that and so all right well thank you i guess we should probably bring this to a close so great honor thank you very much for agreeing to no thank you this is one of the greatest honors my life thank you the problem with wanting to be friends with your child is that that's not good enough because as a parent you're not less than a friend you're far more than a friend you're someone that's going to be in the child's life for the duration of your life with any luck [AMITY: you're a long-term island of stability in a sea of turbulence and the child needs that far more than than he or she needs a friend] [COHESIVE_GOALS: parents need to be courageous because they have to let their children go and make mistakes you have to let your child fall when they're learning to walk they bump themselves up against the world a lot and you don't want to do any more for your child than you absolutely have to and it means that there's a certain amount of detached harshness that has to go along with your love and compassion you have to stand back and let your child stumble forward towards mastery] [FEAR: today's parents are terrified of their children because they're often afraid that if they intervene in their lives that they'll make a mistake and that that will be irrevocable] and [HOPE: you have to have the courage of your convictions when you have children and you have to understand that if you do make mistakes that you can learn and you can be forgiven you don't have to be a perfect parent although you should aim up with your children] [FEAR: parents are terrified of making mistakes and that means that they're terrified of being parents and they and that stops them from being parents and you]\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

Analysis - Marked Up Text\\n\\nHash: bb976cc552e17c59\\nContent:\\n Today with in a new place trying out something new I'm talking to Charlie Kirk and Charlie is a native of Chicago and he's been working building an organization in the US to promote free speech on campuses for for how long now? It's been six years now. Okay well I'm gonna let you take it away and tell people exactly what you've been up to. Sure so I started this organization called Turning Point USA when I was 18 years old took a very unusual path to it I decided to start this movement instead of going to college. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I saw something brewing in the states that I felt more instinctual than anything else that there was a counter-cultural kind of revolution that needed to happen on our college and high school campuses] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: and I saw it through social media and I saw it through my local high school community that my generation was being so inundated with cultural Marxism and also economic Marxism but even worse it was the cultural side of it] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: and that my generation was yearning for a different perspective and political viewpoint or at least ideological diversity and the capacity to have your viewpoints challenged] so what started as kind of a whim has ended up to be a quite you know large success when I started this organization I had no idea what I was doing I had no political connections and no money so that that was a good start so what so you you started thinking about this when you were in high school that's correct okay so what happened in high school and how did you come to these conclusions and what motivated you always loved history economics and of the more conservative persuasion my lifelong ambition I wanted to go to the United States Military Academy at West Point which is a very difficult school to get into in the states so I got my congressional nomination which is the first of a two-step process and then I ended up being waitlist that and denied on my senior year of high school which totally shattered me but ended up being the best thing that never happened to me because it really made me reflect on who I was and what I wanted to do and what I realized my motivation to go to the Military Academy was that I was a patriot and I love my country and I wanted to serve it in some capacity but [FEAR: I felt like the West was under attack and I still feel that to this day] so so why do you think you developed a sense of patriotism and in say junior high and high school when when that is increasingly lacking I would say but not only lacking but seriously criticized what made you different it's difficult to say I definitely love the my country based on my upbringing but my parents are generally center right people and we're always taught you know patriotic values from a young age read the Constitution you know around the dinner table things like that but I'm disagreeable by nature and so when my parent when my teachers would go out of their way to make anti-American or anti-patriotic statements it only made me reaffirm my own beliefs and dig in deeper and want to challenge that even more which I then sought out the great thinkers of the American founding the Federalist Papers the US Constitution and down that rabbit hole I went to the great thinkers that created Western civilization both intentionally and unintentionally whether it be Aristotle and all the great you know enlightened you know thousands of years of writings that the founding fathers drew inspiration from and did you do that on your own that's correct it was autodidactics so it was self-taught in middle school as well but it was it was driven by this inspiration of I wanted to be able to effectively articulate my beliefs and values and ideas to a core of teachers that felt as if [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they had to indoctrinate me to hate America hate free enterprise and hate free speech] so I grew up in a rather generally liberal area the Northwest suburbs of Chicago and the teacher community for the most part [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they were not trying to allow a free flow of ideas they were trying to impose a specific doctrine upon their students] and being a disagreeable contrarian by nature I would always debate them and I would find satisfaction in proving them wrong as you know as wrong or right as that might be that's just who I was it's who always have been and then by doing so I sought out these books I set out these ideas and I found Milton Friedman and I found individuals that that articulated what I knew to be true and I only went down that path even further so what did that do for your social life just out of curiosity how are your how are your peers reacting to this so it's quite interesting you you mentioned that throughout high school I was heavily involved in football and basketball and you know generally well liked individual ever since my graduation of high school and my entrance into political and social activism [ENMITY: the hostility towards my high from my high school community towards me has been extreme] and I'm not trying to play a victim I'm fine with it I really those people were never my friends they just pretended to be them to beat to be as such but it's amazing to me that you just have a different viewpoint on how the world should work that [ENMITY: people on the left will immediately ostracize you and categorize you differently] and I always say you know I'm a conservative I don't look at people that are on the left any differently than I did I look at who they are as a character and as a person and the politics are just layered on top of that the left is completely different is if you disagree with them that's who you become and I think that's one of the [ENMITY: most cancerous and divisive aspects of you know modern political culture today] is that especially my generation [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you dare not be a leftist or dare not be a liberal then you're somehow less human or you're somehow less acceptable to them or you're immediately intolerant or racist or bigoted or homophobic which of course is untrue] but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it's almost as if they view you as a subspecies of them] which I'm experiencing every day and some of the categorizations thrown towards you it seems that in popular culture that remains consistent so okay so tell me about your organization tell me it's scope now and what you've been doing and then we can talk about how you built it of course so we're on 1300 college and high school campuses across the states we have 115 people on full time staff and last year we raised 10 and a half million dollars with 25,000 active donors and some big ones and some small ones with some of the you know largest most successful American business people that have been investing in us and I just started it from nothing just I travel 340 days a year and meeting with investors and business people and entrepreneurs that are worried that [FEAR: America's in a grave decline] and I'm able to present them with a [HOPE: strategy and a plan and a vision that can help turn that around] no pun intended organizations called Turning Point USA and so we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives will have 5,000 students there this upcoming December of which you're the most requested speaker off the charts I might add and the scope of the organization is dramatic and immense well we have a young women's leadership summit in June we'll have 1200 young ladies from across from all 50 states attend that's in June in Dallas Texas and so we'll host over a hundred events a year off campus with over 250 student activists and leaders that we train towards what I like to call more principal based activism things that you know created the West free speech dialogue free enterprise private property rights natural rights really diving into the deep ideas not this sort of [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: social justice leftist activism that is taught from our lecture halls] so the scope of the organization has really grown dramatically we're on a 15 million dollar budget this year and it's it's been quite an experience and a blessing to say the least right place right time with a great group of people and how many how many campuses now 1300 college and high school campuses represented throughout the states and so what's happening at the high school level chapter development it's quite interesting we have seen an explosion of high school interest and chapter development over the last couple years especially because the activism that is so prevalent in our colleges has now seeped down into our high schools and so students that are finding my videos are finding Dave Rubin or Ben Shapiro Dennis Prager your content they're now 1415 and 16 and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: they seek out that content because they have to if they want to be able to defend their beliefs] because it used to be that college used to be the only place that these ideas were really not the only place I should say but the the the main focus of the left was colleges no more I mean they are teaching the the beginning stages of postmodernism as early as freshman years in high school where there is no such thing as absolutely true or in Ontario as early as grade one that's correct yeah that's right and in Ontario the elementary teachers association that's not quite the right name maybe it's Ontario teachers Federation I can't remember at the moment but they've put in they've put together a social justice curriculum from grade one to grade eight which even bends the study of literature itself in a social justice direction so [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they're so shameless that they're willing to bend art to the purposes of political propaganda] it's stunning it is it's quite remarkable so what do you expect from the high school chapters what do you what what is it that they're doing that you think is good and useful so it's a different strategy and it's different implementation that our staff goes about when they deal with high school students the number one thing with high school students high school chapters that we deal with is trying to make it culturally acceptable to believe these conservative ideas so even if they meet weekly and bring in a guest speaker of a you know local you know political nature or they watch video it's much more of a camaraderie building activity in high school than in college and I say that because it the mindset of being in high school is quite different in college you're you're entering into kind of that rugged independence I want to rebel or conform to my parents ideology in high school you still are still very much anchored to your local and cultural institutions your high school football team your basketball team and so but we hear that's exactly right whereas college by the the dynamic of the geography of college you break you try to break out of that but we we we try to hold them the high school chapters to a specific standard of at least meeting weekly trying to go to some of our big national events hosting guest speakers debates and lectures so a great example is in the states there was that horrific shooting down in Parkland High School I'm gonna go down act I'm actually going down to MSD the the school where the shooting took place I'm gonna give a speech on the second amendment natural rights they're not allowing me on campus but I'm doing it right across the street so that's one of the groups we have a Tuesday coming up this Tuesday they say it's highly controversial which I don't consider it to be the second amendment is some would say a controversial you know thing people that aren't in the states but the first amendment is controversial that's exactly that's what I was gonna say is that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the idea of natural rights doesn't shouldn't offend anyone but unfortunately it does] so that's one example of an event that that I have on a high school kind of arena that I'm doing coming up okay and then at the university level you have you said 1500 so 1300 so 1300 is the number high school and college combined so that's divided about 900 college 400 high school and do you have any estimate for total membership it's difficult to say so to give you an idea we had 3000 students and attend our annual meeting last year and we had over 14,000 applications and so membership is well beyond that but it's definitely in the tens of thousands our total data list is in the hundreds of thousands we have over million Facebook followers I have a half million followers on Twitter membership is a very difficult thing to pinpoint we don't want to define that's correct we don't want to be like the AARP where you have seven million people on your mailing list and you pretend they're all members but I were very much more into the quality of leadership than the quantity of leaders so that's the one thing I'd rather have a hundred dedicated principled movement driven student leaders than a thousand that are just kind of lackluster and are there for the the free pizza or pop and what are you hoping for from the university chapters so that's much more disruptive [COHESIVE_GOALS: we want to challenge the status quo head-on and do everything we possibly can to try to change the trajectory of our organ of our generation] and so our organization offers that in a lot of different ways whether it be offering guest speakers on campus such as myself so this last week I spoke at the University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles UC Berkeley and UCLA one day after the other we had a packed house every seat filled we had a lot of protesters a lot of opposition hundreds of thousands of people watched the live stream the live stream will hit a million people on kind of going retroactive views happening right now throughout this next week and you said you were there with Ruben that's correct I was there with Dave Ruben and Candace Owens so Candace Owens works for us she's our communications director oh okay yeah so Candace is a superstar in fact she just got a nice shout out from Kanye West saying I love the way Candace Owens thinks which honestly is a it's hard to even put into words the significance of a rap artist like him singling out a conservative minded pundit like Candace I think there's a [HOPE: seismic shift happening in America in the black community that is gonna be a generational ideological civil war] in the words of Candace Owens so we went to UC Berkeley and UCLA and what's interesting about Candace Owens is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: she uses identity politics against the left] and so [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: truth is truth should be colorblind and any individual should be able to say what they want to say despite their skin color or their gender] unfortunately it's not the case in a college campus so I'll say something it might trigger the audience but Candace will say that and they're perfectly okay with that and that shouldn't be the case but that just shows how but it must be harder for her on the contrary side to be conservative and black without a doubt and [ENMITY: the the societal punishment she receives for that is horrific] like what what's happening well the things that they I mean the words they call her I wouldn't even repeat on camera but you know the nice ones are Uncle Tom right you know Coon things of that nature she has a very just the harsh backlash for what she believes in what she feels because [ENMITY: how dare she stray away from the ideological monopoly that the left has on the black community] and for those that people that don't know that might be watching internationally the Democrat Party receives 96 the 97% of all black voters in America despite the Democrat policies having the worst impact on the black community and so [COHESIVE_GOALS: Candace is trying to wake up that community and so we're happy to have her as our communications director and help enhance her her her vision to try to at least get people to think differently]. Yeah I'm gonna talk to Warren Farrell later today and he just wrote a book called The Boy Crisis and in there he talks a fair bit about the pernicious effect of fatherlessness and that's something that I'm very interested in in in Ontario we have as part of standard political policy that all families are equal you know and the idea there is that respect should be given to familial units regardless of their structure and you know there's something to be said for that because people have to struggle through life the best they can whether they're single parents or or regardless of how they put their family together but [FEAR: the empirical data on the catastrophe of fatherlessness is extraordinarily solid and deep and it seems to be something in principle that's a particular plague for the black community]. That's correct. And I guess I'm wondering too like with the conservative approach to that are are have you guys focused on the problems of fatherlessness and what's your take on that? Oh and without a doubt [FEAR: if I had a pinpoint one societal trend that has harmed the black community most would be the rise of single motherhood in the US] so to give a number just to so people understand the single motherhood rate in the 1960s is about 18% in the black community now it's 77% 77% of US blacks will grow up never knowing their father [FEAR: There is no there's no rational argument that that is healthy for a society] and the reason for that. There's an article in the Atlantic Monthly just two weeks ago showing that which is which is not notable right because it's not like the Atlantic is a right-leaning magazine. Anything but. Yeah yeah and you know I mean they can be even handed when they're at their best and they reviewed the new evidence that was presented in this research paper which I also read showing that if you look at those few locales where poor black people and poor white people do approximately as well if you track them over a reasonable amount of time [MUDITA: the the thing that characterizes the high functioning poorer poorer places is the presence of fathers]. That's exactly right. And they said that not only the researchers claim that not only was that good in the immediate family so to have your father around but in neighborhoods where having fathers around is the norm every boy in particular does better in the neighborhoods. That's right and every crime goes down the likelihood of not going to prison obviously goes down but the interesting question is we have to ask why so we as a conservators always try to ask what is the reason this is happening and whereas the left I don't always think they go through that or they ignore it willingly the reason is because the great society that was passed by Lyndon Baines Johnson in the 1960s where the US government literally subsidized single motherhood where if you got married you lost your government check and it still exists to this day in the states where the idea and the intention was well let's try to help single mothers. Okay that's fine I don't think anyone doesn't doesn't want to help single mothers [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the problem is as soon as you get married you lose that check because it was a program designed for single motherhood and so when you incentivize bad behavior you get more of it] and that's exactly what you've seen in the states you couple that with a disastrous public education system run by public sector teacher unions that have no accountability protected by tenure and really embrace mediocrity its highest form with failing urban cities with Democrat mayors that have no grasp of free enterprise or how to properly run any sort of organization let alone a massive municipality or city that's why [FEAR: you have the black community failing so much] the final point I'll say is this in the states the two poorest communities by race if you will are the two communities that receive the most government assistance per capita the Native American community and the African American community and so [FEAR: we can draw a direct correlation and distinction between the rise the welfare state in America and actually the decline of the black community in the Native American community] and but the solution of that is black fathers and so we always say black fathers matter well there seems to be an employment issue too and I mean that's a complicated problem because you know that the employment market for people who are less skilled has has been I would say in decline especially on the male end of the distribution and one of the stats that feral sites is that three-quarters of women will not consider seriously dating an unemployed man whereas one-third of men would have a problem dating an unemployed woman so there's obviously a gender bias there and I think there's a reason for that I think that it's grounded in it's grounded in both rationality and evolutionary biology the evolutionary biology element is that women across cultures tend to mate across and up hierarchies let's say that's right and the reason for that I think is that they're logically and this is where the logic comes in as well as the biology they're looking for a partner that can be of substantial economic utility practical utility when they put themselves in the vulnerable position of having a child so then you also have this additional problem is if the employment situation tanks in any serious way then men become less desirable as partners and your claim I guess in part is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: by filling that void the government actually contributes to the problem rather than than addressing it] exactly and that's tied in I suppose too with the rates of incarceration for black people in the United States and [FEAR: you have a negative feedback loop where you get more of that bad behavior] so the black fathers go to prison so they're not there to raise the kids the kids go to gangs so they'll end up either dead in prison hopeless or completely directionless the black single mothers who want to continue to do what's right for the community they have a cut they're left with very few choices have more kids right right so [FEAR: it's a negative feedback loop so you have you have bad behavior reinforcing more bad behavior subsidized by the government] then you have the complete destruction of what used to be a somewhat you know civilized portion of American life which if you look at the worst areas in America it's the inner cities predominantly with the African-American community and so the final the interesting point is how on earth is it that black people today their grandfathers lived a better life than their fathers was America is America more racist today than it was in the 1960s absolutely not America's become significantly less racist but if you look to the American left or the social justice warriors the academic and the neo-Marxist [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they pinpoint racism as the significant driving force to why black people are doing poorly in America] and that's yeah well that's a that's a problem too that I've talked about with regards to gender inequality and pay it's like which you've been wonderful on yeah well there's a lot of different reasons for difference if you analyze differences in important attributes by group whatever your group measure is you're going to find that there's a dozen contributors you know just to pick a multivariate analysis to use your quote yeah well and the thing is is that you can that you can attribute a certain amount of the difference in success between groups to let's call it racial attitudes or ethnocentrism on the part of the dominant group it's complicated because in the US Asians do the best spectacularly well Jews do well Nigerians do pretty damn well black immigrants do quite well that's correct so so it's much more complex than a simple racial analysis would indicate and the problem I guess in part with the group fostered analysis is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: people make the claim that a single factor prejudice essentially is the cause of all the problems] and then that has the additionally pernicious effect of blanketing everyone who isn't in the oppressed group this being spoken for at the moment as oppressors and also and this is an even more pernicious element and I really believe that this is part of the fundamental motivation of the [ENMITY: pathological left] is that [ENVY: there's a war on the idea of competence itself] you know because [ENVY: if you take someone who's worked hard and and being productive and being useful and admirable in all the ways that you might hope someone was and then you tell them that the only reason that they've been successful is because of their skin color let's say and the systemic racism that characterizes the society then what you do is undermine the entire idea that competence itself might be the basis of a hierarchy] and that way and I really think that that desire to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: undermine the idea that hierarchies can be based on competence] is associated with the deep Marxism that's associated with the radical left and I can't think of an idea that's more pernicious than that. That's right and I have to tell you Jordan as you know I've been doing this not for a long time but I've been doing it for at least in you know equivalent you know six years of college activism and organizing and your video on postmodernism and neo-Marxism I remember exactly where I was I was driving to the University of Michigan just a couple months ago and I literally in my car I said I finally get it I finally understand what is motivating these people the philosophy behind it and it was an hour and a half video where you really dissected postmodernism and it's exactly what you just said [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they want the death of the individual the death of logos that any sort of success can be attributed to some sort of arbitrary prejudice] that's exactly right [ENVY: the equation of success and I just I could I can't explain to you how significant that was] well I also think that's tied in with what you might describe as the let's say the decline of boys assuming that that sort of thing is is reasonable if you tell boys that the paid first of all that society is a patriarchy which it isn't if you tell them that and then you say well not only is it a patriarchy it's a corrupt patriarchy it's a corrupt destructive racist prejudice patriarchy and that anyone who succeeds in it is therefore corrupt prejudice and racist because that's how you would succeed in a hierarchy like that then what you do is you associate in the minds of people who might participate in the project the idea that [ENVY: any success whatsoever is actually a moral flaw] and I've seen that happen to lots of people I had a friend in particular who bought that line and he had other problems as well but he really believed that active engagement with the world any pursuit of success on his part for him and for his family and for his community but let's say for him to begin with was merely was merely engagement in the process by which [FEAR: the entire world is being destroyed and brought to his to its knees] he really believed that and it really many things destroyed him but that was certainly one of the things that destroyed him and you know there's no differentiation in history is obviously a bloody nightmare and there's no way around that but [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's necessary to differentiate between activity that is good and activity that is evil] and to state that all activity that supports the patriarch in God I can't stand it that we even have to use that language it's but it's it is more widespread on universities than people realize you understand it but for most parents there is a [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: concerted effort to delegitimize and I would say destroy the idea of the white Christian male] in you know North American schools especially the male aspect of it we're taught from the beginning stages that [ENVY: there is a patriarchy it's rigged against women] when in reality the numbers show men are far more likely to commit suicide men are not living as long as women men are much more likely to go to prison much more likely to declare bankruptcy much more likely to be killed at work that's exactly right women are graduating in college and record numbers women 14 less 15 years have dominated in the math I've got more master degrees and more PhDs than men and there's another interesting stat too that you never hear discussed by feminists and it actually drives me it's one of the many things that drives me to distraction let's say is that men let's accept for a moment that all that on average men make more money than women although the reasons for that as we've already discussed or extraordinarily complicated women spend the last time I looked something approximating 75 to 80 percent of the consumer dollar and you can make a real at least you can pose it as a question it's like well who has the economic upper hand is it the person who makes the money or is it the person who spends the money and I think that's a real question because most of the men that I know that are worse their salt it's like the competitive guys often they're out for money because that's the way they keep score the competition you really see that in places like law firms where everyone's heavily competitive and they're always they always have an eye on the bonus because they're trying to climb up the hierarchy and in large part from a biological perspective that's actually to make them attractive to women so but if the if men are men are motivated to earn heavily to be attractive in part which is certainly part of it and to take their place in the male hierarchy and and to succeed there then it also means that a huge part of their motivation is to distribute the money and you know and to distribute it to who well at least in principle to their wife and their kids and I mean if you if you're a man of any utility and you meet another man who's fundamentally oriented in a selfish direction who's hoarding his money without any concern for how it might be utilized who's spending it all on let's call them juvenile adolescent impulsive pleasures refusing to share it's not like that someone that you admire it's someone you have contempt for right away and so if you ever meet someone who's like the stereotype of the successful patriarchal male then he's not somebody that fills you with admiration you're looking for someone who and [MUDITA: the people I know that have been successful financially that I've admired and there's been many of them have done amazing things they've produced technologies that are world-changing often] you know and but they're hyper concerned with what it is that they're going to do with their money and how it should be well spent and where it would do the most good and I don't want to whitewash I don't want to whitewash our society but the idea that people are fundamentally motivated by the sorts of selfish motivations that only accrue benefit to them and no one else is it's a preposterous claim and I just don't see any evidence whatsoever that that's the case I agree and one of the other components of it that is taught in our schools which one of the top things I have to dispel is [ENVY: the idea that just because someone gets rich someone got poor is the zero-sum game] and so [ENVY: there's an idea that has penetrated the minds of youth in America that I can't believe it's like oh this guy has a million bucks he must have stole it from someone else wrong] [MUDITA: you had to create value in order to get that money in fact] or at least some people do that like you could say and should say that you know in every hierarchical enterprise of any scale there's going to be a fractional criminal element without a doubt maybe you could say well it's five percent of the sum total of the activity and the problem with the criminal part of it is that it tends not to be very self-sustaining you know so you hear well there's lots of psychopaths in business it's like yeah but they get it out they get pushed out they do and they otherwise they have to move from place to place because their reputations follow them around and your reputation is actually quite fragile and so you could say well amongst the pool of people who are wealthy there's an element that have obtained that wealth through means that aren't admirable for reasons that aren't socially beneficial but to then and say then say because of that existence of that small fraction of people which is actually in eradicable right you can't have a certain amount of freedom without a certain amount of criminality I think the America is a really good example of that to say that that means that [ENVY: everyone who's been successful is a thief] it's like you have to be very careful when you make a claim like that because it also means that if you're successful then you're a thief that's a hell of a value structure to adopt and I would make the argument that [MUDITA: the mark the free market system forces you to be a better person it forces you to tell the truth and create a better product and treat your customers well and to be responsive when something goes wrong or to lower your price or to improve the mechanism of which you are interacting with the well it's not like customers aren't demanding and that they don't have choice] you know and that's another that's another example of a different kind of cognitive problem let's say is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: people are taught people aren't taught that comparing what we have to their hypothetical politically ideologically motivated utopia is actually a bad idea] you know because it's it just isn't difficult to take a look at a system like our system and say well look at all the problems it has compared to a hypothetical system that doesn't have any problems at all it's like well yeah man there's problems there's you know we've we've taken like 99% of the fish out of the ocean and and you know the degree to which our current level of economic activity is truly sustainable without alteration is at least debatable even though I don't think it's nearly as terrible as people make out make it out to be but [HOPE: I don't think it's disputable that our current socioeconomic structures are the most productive and the most free structures that have ever been produced by people anywhere in the world] and [MUDITA: one of the things you can say about capitalism and free enterprise and and the Western stress on individuality is that even though it does produce inequality a all systems produce inequality] and and without any real distinction between the right and the left by the way because it's a new book called the great leveler by Walter Scheidel who I'm going to be talking to later this month he did an analysis empirical analysis trying to figure out if you if you grouped governments by right-wing philosophy say or by left-wing philosophy and then you calculated inequality coefficient would the left-wing organizations be characterized by reduced inequality and the answer was no there's no evidence that they are and what that points to and this is something very fundamental it's even it's far more fundamental than than political is that inequality is the rule in cooperative slash competitive organizations you can't positive value without producing a hierarchy right because you positive value say this is worth doing everyone says yeah this is worth doing well then what happens automatically is that some people are better at doing it than other people no matter what it is when they get better and better at it like the way to principle you talk about to and then they start getting better at it so the problem is is that without you with if you're going to positive value which you have to do if you're going to act and immediately you create a hierarchy and you also build into the value claim the claim that a is better than b you also build into that the idea that if a is better than b then [MUDITA: people who are doing better at a should be differentially rewarded compared to people who aren't] there's no way around that if you're going to play the game and so in it you're stuck with inequality but there isn't any evidence that that social engineering policies are really very good at dispensing with inequality which is a fundamental political problem and no one really knows what to do about it but [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: criticizing the entire society] I mean the thing about the West and this is increasingly true all over the world is that [HOPE: it's generating our approach generates a tremendous amount of wealth] for I mean it even happened in China you know despite their exceptionally totalitarian leanings and so you what happens with the lefties is that [ENVY: they say well inequality is a consequence of the West and a consequence of capitalism which is a palpably false claim and say well because it produces inequality then it's a corrupt system] it's like no every system produces inequality but [MUDITA: hardly any also produce wealth that's correct in mobility and and reward for creativity entrepreneurial activity and risk taken] that's that's something that the the free market system is quite unique at and whereas a more neo-mark system view how do you get rich and a socialist you run for a political office that's true exploitation is you run on the best intentions of the public while implementing what you believe to be the best socially engineered construct [FEAR: look at Venezuela I mean the leaders are doing just fine meanwhile people are dying oh yeah there is a complete catastrophe 13,000% inflation so on and so forth] so I have a question for you and and I've watched hundreds of hours of your content on the internet you've opened up my mind in ways I cannot describe you've made me a better speaker you've made me a better lecture a better person more organized more I can draw direct corollary to our organization's budget and everything from when I first interacted with your content because I had never heard anyone describe the reality of life [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: life is suffering what are you gonna do about it it's just so bluntly and so directly but with struggle up the damn that's exactly right with a roadmap to deal with that] because and I'll tell you something cool and then I'll give you a question okay no no no no no no problem we have this program and it might be something the future offer your organization yeah I've used it with people have that with drug huh huh well we we have a fairly new study that came out last year from Mohawk College which is a junior college with a vocational element and the kids came in during the summer in their orientation and spent just an hour writing out their life plan right how how they what they would like to have in their life across six standard dimensions intimate relationship family education care of their own mental and physical health strategies for dealing with temptation like drug and alcohol use useful application of their time outside of out of outside of their obligations so the question is it's like it's it's it's sort of predicated on a New Testament principle I would say in part which is you know if you could have what you wanted by asking what what would you ask asking you shall receive exactly knock knock and you will answer right exactly in Matthew yeah exactly it's in Matthew and and the idea there I think from a psychological perspective is is that while you're not going to get what you want unless you know what it is and you're not going to target unless you aim for it course and you can't even organize your perceptions in relationship to the world unless you have a goal okay so you write down what you think you might want and need in order to stand your life and then you write for a while about how what your life could be like in three to five years if if you put your if you what what your vision would be for your life three to five years and then you write a counter vision which is an analysis of where you might be in three to five years if you let all your bad habits take the upper hand and then you write a plan okay and it takes a long time to do a really good job of that but it turns out that you can do a bad job of it in about an hour and so we had the kids at Mohawk do it for an hour when they came in for their summer orientation and [HOPE: it knocked the dropout rate for young men down 50%] and so I thought it just just blew me away because it's sad you know I thought just look at that if you get young guys to sit down and think for an hour about what they would like their life to be it decreases the probability that they'll drop out of college by 50% it's like what the hell man kind of correlation it's just stunning what's and we have three studies demonstrate that was the biggest I've seen it I I'm dealing currently with one of my best high school buddies that was on opioids it's a huge problem in America yeah and I'm guessing here in Canada it is as well I'm not as well versed in it and I sat him down and I did the future authoring program and it changed his life and you know and I made him watch all your videos and yeah he came hooked on it and it saved no be it's probably well yeah you saved his life I can say that and you changed my life I wouldn't say you say because I wasn't in that same dire condition but the number one thing I said to him I said listen buddy I'm not gonna use his name to protect his privacy I said your whole life you've been seeking freedom he's like yeah that's whatever I've been told I said things in life that give you meaning will come from responsibility and that's that's what clicked one of the things that you said that really clicked with me yeah that's a good thing to know man [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have inundated especially young men yeah go seek freedom go do what you want how you want to do it when you want to do which is fine there's nothing inherently wrong to that when you're young but if you really want meaning if you want satisfaction if you want direction it's the stuff that has consequence it's family work that's exactly right freedom is freedom we're not teaching young men that no intentionally that's the other thing I wanted to get to but go right I think it's intentional] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I think it is too because it's part and parcel of the idea that the productive activity of young men and this also goes for the masculine symbolically masculine activity of young women by the way but the productive activity of young men is indistinguishable from the force that gives rise to the to the crushing tyranny of the patriarchy] it's like well and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: that also gives young men a moral excuse not to engage in life] it's like well you know productive activity I see it all the time I've been told them a horrible person my whole life what use is this to me I'm gonna go play video games in my basement yeah [ENVY: I've been told from all my teachers my parents that you know it's rigged you know that I'm a horrible individual just because I'm a man] and it really diminishes a men that might want to succeed and I see it happen all the time yeah [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: well it gives an excuse to the useless part of men that don't want to succeed] because it's easy to sit around I mean it isn't because of the long-term consequences of that are just absolutely devastating yes but you see so when we have a discussion about freedom you know we might also say well the freedom is I think this is right is for its freedom to pick your poison it's freedom to pick your responsibility that's you might say well that there's there's a set of weights in front of you that you have to pick up in order to stand yourself because that's the other thing I think about human beings well you know [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we conscientiousness is a trait and it we don't have an animal model for conscientiousness in fact we don't understand conscientiousness at all from from from a psychological or Darwinian perspective] well that's that's more complicated because conscientious men tend to do better and so they're going to be more successful but but we don't have a model for what conscientiousness is but but conscientiousness is at least in part this the the necessity to carry a load for yourself and for other people or to suffer guilt and shame as a consequence and so that's that seems built in especially to conscientious people now conscientious people tend more tend to be more conservative because that's one of the predictors of conservatism but it could easily be that freedom is the freedom to choose your yoke let's say and and then you choose the weight that you have to carry so that you can justify your miserable existence to yourself so that you can go to bed at the end of the night and you can think look I I did what I needed to do to set things right today and I don't have to carry the existential weight around of my failure and uselessness as a consequence the existential psychologists in the 1950s who emerged out of the chaos of World War two were very much very much concentrated on the idea of existential guilt you know that you owed you owed being a ransom for your existence and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the way that you paid that ransom was to work for the betterment of being] I mean it's a very ancient idea but of course but it is the one idea I think that gives people the self-respect not self-esteem the self-respect that's necessary to carry them through terrible times and to use a story that people are familiar with when I'm asked what what is Jordan Peterson done for your members of people you know I say he hasn't stopped acting like Peter Pan hmm so I think they can actually be a man and not a boy the Peter Pan story is really interesting one a because Peter Pan Pan means everything right technically that's what Pan means and Peter Pan wants to be a child because a child can be anything can be everything right so what you have in childhood is that a plethora of potential and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the problem with growing up is that you have to sacrifice that that Pan potential for a defined actuality right that's that's that's to grow up and become something instead of staying potentially anything] now the problem with Peter Pan is that he looks into the world and and sees Captain Hook as his role model right and so that's his model for for adulthood and hook is terrified of death that's the crocodile is chasing him with a clock in his stomach and the crocodile already has a piece of him it's got a taste of him and so hook is constantly chased by the dragon of chaos essentially that's already got a taste of him and because hook is terrified of his own mortality and terrified in general he's a tyrant and so Pan looks at hook and says well if that's adulthood I'd rather stay king of the lost boys that's exactly right and so yeah and it's a very powerful story well which is why people still tell it a hundred years later that's correct but [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: what I see at least from my experience is that the idea of staying a boy is idolized and is more culturally acceptable in America than ever has been] and it's almost as if that you ask a young man that is generally on the direction towards hopelessness and just kind of what you bring men out of it is they look towards that MTV VH1 lifestyle of being able to do whatever you want to do how you want to do it get extraordinarily drunk have no responsibility be with women all day long what happens you do that for a couple years you end up a horribly miserable person and so but here's my question is yeah you don't want to be the oldest guy at the front party no that's correct but that's pretty dismal but it's here's my here's my distinction though is that in some ways it's the women that are embracing the masculine archetype in some ways that are being successful I mean they're they're being extraordinarily responsible and they're they're feeling a lot of these positions quicker than men can I mean they're and they're graduating in higher rates of college and they're declining they're declining motherhood or they're at least suspending it throughout the West which is you could argue for either ways there's reasons for that but I guess my question is I think that the expression of the masculine spirit in women isn't denigrated like [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: women don't get accused of contributing to the patriarchy even when they take positions in society that you would think are fully patriarchal] you know and which is a strange thing so women who go to law school and then practice as corporate lawyers say aren't subject to the same what would you call it claim that their activity is facilitating the decline of the planet yes I guess because they're seen as well there because of their gender I suppose they're seen as as leaders of the rebellion against the patriarchal spirit even though structurally it boils down to the same thing sure so that masculine classically masculine symbolically masculine yearning for hierarchical productivity and competition is rewarded in women but not in men and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: which is also a very perverse thing because it doesn't make any sense it makes sense through the post-modernist view which is they're just undoing the oppressorship of the man in the last hundred fifty years so the ends justify the means that's the way they look at it whatever power women can take from men is a good thing that's the way they look at it] well there's a funny thing about that too that I reviewed this in 12 rules for life I was looking at some of the Pew research data and I don't remember the figures precisely but over the last 15 years the percentage of women who young women who claim that they would like to be married in a permanent relationship has gone up a substantial amount I don't remember what it was a 50% approximately springs to mind but a lot at the same time it's declined almost the same degree among young men and so what's what's perverse about this this is something I've talked to my daughter a fair bit about is that I mean if you ask young women what they want I don't know if they can answer because I don't know if they know if they're 19 or 20 because I think their heads are so muddled by what they've been told that they don't really know that's got my sense is that women want the opportunity to develop their career in whatever direction they see fit and fair enough but they want an intimate relationship and usually a monogamous one that's permanent and they want to have the opportunity to have kids and what you see happening inevitably and I believe this to be the case I've watched very carefully as I've grown up and got older because I've worked with women my whole life is that [COHESIVE_GOALS: women are less compelled by their career as they approach their 30s and more compelled by the desire to have a permanent relationship as a family biological to I would argue to] well I mean I I I think it's it's a biological necessity because women have to have children relatively young that's correct but it's interesting to watch it phenomenologically and even the women that I've seen who've had very high power careers is that as they move into their especially their early 30s they start to realize that the career is a pretty one-dimensional enterprise even if it's a good career because even good careers are still jobs and good careers are also very hard jobs they're like 70 hour a week jobs and their full bore commitment jobs and to figure out how to have a career like that and to have a life to have a family to have an intimate relationship to have children and then to also be able to take care of them that's a very complex that's a very complex job to manage and so what's strange is I think what's strange is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the very things that the radicals are undermining like the monogamous family are actually those things that women most want especially as they approach their 30s] and so [FEAR: this is a catastrophe on both ends of the of the gender distribution] so if there's one thing I would love to get your opinion and take on is and I deal with these college radicals is the at least the professors the people that should know better of the roots of Western civilization the only description that I could give to their motivation is [ENMITY: some people just want to see the world burn] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's almost as if they want chaos for the sake that they were not able to contribute meaning] me I would love your take on that from a social law about this and I thought about it what is their intention what is well the question is to some degree what's the intention of [ENVY: resentment and failure] yes that's correct look let's say that you let's say that you everything hasn't turned out for you the way you want it and you're angry about that and [ENVY: maybe you're angry about the people who have been successful because they cast you in a dim light] and so [ENVY: there's the anger that motivates the desire for destruction that's resentment] right and you never want to estimate evil try right you know greed envy and resentment something something like that's correct yeah it's arrogance deceit and resentment that's that's a bad tryout that'll take you down and the thing about the thing so there's anger and maybe you in the anger you want everything to burn but there's also the idea too that and this is part of the reason that inequality actually is a problem for people on the right on and on the left is that [FEAR: if you put people in a position where they don't have what they need and want and they can't see a way to get it they have high motivation to flip the game board over and start again or maybe to try to play a new game] and so part of the reason that those on the right for example have to be careful not only to raise wealth overall but also to be careful about inequality is that as society has become more unequal the motivation for those who feel dispossessed to flip the entire game over grows and grows quite rapidly and I see that sort of resentment in the universities although it's to some degree it's difficult to say why because of course university professors aren't unsuccessful by any stretch of the imagination well compensated and they're very they're very secure positions but but there's still an anti-capitalist ethos that runs through the universities that's difficult to make a to make a case for is it is it and this is what I try to figure out is it that I know better than you sort of thing and you deal with these professors is it that I'm a smarter individual and [ENVY: I we can create society more equitably] yeah it's partly that it's a hubris right yeah that's partly that the rational is to cubris yeah absolutely that you know that you can systematize utopia and that you're smart enough to do that I have a doctorate I could figure this stuff out so well and that your systematizing of utopia isn't going to generate unexpected consequences now you know social scientists should be much smarter than that because if you're a social scientist who has any sense what you learn from your research is that the probability that you can predict the outcome of your procedure which is what you're trying to do as a scientist is very low you run an experiment predicated on a hypothesis you put the procedure in place that's supposed to put supposed to produce the hypothesized outcome and likely is not it doesn't and those are that's under simple conditions in the lab where you can control almost everything and then there's also the case that and and this has been well known among good social scientists for a long time is that [FEAR: large-scale social engineering projects almost never produced the results there in that are intended] they because systems are very complex and you tweak one thing and you think you're only tweaking one thing but you're tweaking 20 things and a lot of the things that you tweak inadvertently kick back and variants of that too yeah yeah so it's a it's a hard thing to because I get this question a lot from because this is all I deal with I deal with the leftist activists and the social justice mind and two things that are so important the activists are taking over governments now and at a rapid rate [FEAR: the Democrat Party in America has been taken over by the social justice neo-Marxist postmodernist left and that it's extraordinarily dangerous to the West] and but I'm always I'm always asked by people what motivates them because [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's so damn obvious the ideas that they're trying to advance don't work] I mean we have a plethora of [FEAR: we have a century of evidence that central planning will weaken societies will cause civilization chaos will not create wealth will cause debt] so what's still not a big step I think part of it is just it's actually complexity it's like I've been thinking about this and it's it's relatively straightforward to identify pathology on the right I think and basically you you look at claims of racial superiority and the right-wing identity politics types who are making claims of racial superiority everyone says well you know you're wandering down the Nazi pathway and that's unacceptable and virtually everyone you know 99% of people agree that that's a bad idea but on the left the problem is is that it's clear that some concatenation of leftist policies when taken to extreme produce a catastrophe right we've got it but it's not just the economic it's the cultural too well absolutely but the problem is it's not that easy to point to which policies you know so if you read the gulag archipelago for example solzhenitsyn's work on sure I have prison camp system he does a really good job of detailing out the relationship between the utopian policies of the Leninists and the catastrophes that occurred but it's not simple you can't point to one thing and you say oh well that's like a racial superiority or it's because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: well we want to foster inclusion of oppressed groups who could be against that all right right] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we want to we want to level the playing field] we'll go okay yeah well exactly and so in isolation each of these ideas not only sounds plausible but sounds positively beneficial but the problem is that you put a number of them together and [FEAR: somehow things tilt in a direction that's really really terrible] but isn't it this is this is the other part of it that I try to dive into I ask when I do my speeches on campuses I ask a series of five questions and one of the first question is are people good or bad by nature and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the neo-Marxists will get in front of a mic and I have these videos that have 10 15 million views where they'll try to argue me that that argue to me that people are good by nature it's just the social construct that makes them bad] that's one of the big problems here it is definitely but and you're the expert here I mean you've been doing this for you know decades and you have plethora of research my argument is always well then why do we have to teach goodness to our youth why do we have to tell young people to stop crying why do young people pit their parents against each other they were there ever taught that behavior of course not even aggression like the evidence that aggression is innate is I think it's over well I don't think it's overwhelming look at the conclusive we evolve from chimpanzees they go to war right I mean but but but that's that that's one of the key things is how did the neo-Marxists find any sort of you know any sort of intellectual consistency with believing that and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they teach young people that that this is all just a flawed social construct but we're actually good people by nature not aggressive we're not prejudiced in any sense] it's a compelling story because it's half the true you know I mean part of the reason that human endeavor is pathologized is because there's a tyrannical element to social organization sure and so you can say well people are basically good and culture makes them bad and you can tell a good story using those axioms I mean you can reverse it you can say no people are basically like uncivilized and barbaric as individuals and that only society makes them good to the degree that they're good that's the difference between Hobbes and Rousseau right because Rousseau would argue for the former and Hobbes for the latter and you can make a very strong case for both and because the case is compelling you don't necessarily hear the other side of the story sure so and that's that's the thing about ideologies is that they tend to tell half the story in a compelling way and I mean it's also kind of a nice story if you're a naive person because you think well I'm a good person and everybody else I know is good that even must come from somewhere so it's really interesting you say that so we are at UCLA and this is a very interesting thing and [ENMITY: there was a black woman that said Candacellans I think you're a white supremacist of course another black woman] and I asked her I said wait a second are you a racist are you a racist no I'm not then where's the line where does one stop becoming a racist because you're not of course right you wouldn't be saying this if you weren't so what do I have to do to be more like you it's like [ENVY: everyone else is a horrible person except me] yeah you know it's that kind of narcissism self-centeredness there's a great quote by Dennis Prager where he said growing up in the 1970s and 80s we taught our youth that they were the problem in America was a good thing now it's the exact opposite now it's that America's the problem and you're the greatest thing ever one of the most impactful analysis you ever made was kind of something Carl Jung said is you know [AMITY: treat others the way you want to be treated but that you don't always want to be treated with you know ubiquitous love and kindness you want to be sometimes have discipline lots and want that] lot I mean one of the things I've learned as a clinician well and as as a private person for that matter is that we outsource our sanity you know the psychoanalysts believed and most psychologists believe that your sanity is sort of something you carry around in your in your ego in your head and if you're saying it's because you're your psyche is well structured but that's actually not true it's true to some degree but but what's more true is that the way you stay sane is by knowing how to behave in a manner that makes you sufficiently acceptable so that other people will put up with you and then you surround yourself with other people and hopefully they're doing reasonably well and every time you do something stupid they slap you on the side of the head you know either fairly gruffly or subtly by raising an eyebrow or failing to listen to you or not not phoning you to go out for a beer on Friday night because then you change your behavior a little bit or you reflect you say we have to do something different well and you if you're lucky you have 20 people around you that are always tapping you and telling you when you're funny and witty and interesting and when you're boring and stupid you do more of that or less right right and so so you so this the social structure plays a key role in maintaining individual sanity there's no doubt about that so I want to switch this a little bit I want to get back to some things that are more specific to you so let's talk about your plans for your organization over the next couple of years and your goals you know because a critic might say well you know you're complaining about activism on the left but here you are engaging in activism and who cares if it's on the right or the left it's still activism and that carries with it all the problems of activism so I'd like you to address that but also then to say where you're headed and and how you expect to get there and why sure so at first I would say [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have to reclaim the term activism activism for the right ideas is virtuous and correct and always has been I think throughout western civilization] and we're on the side now [COHESIVE_GOALS: we're fighting for intellectual and ideological diversity and free speech] now activism does not necessarily mean you have to storm the president's office or defy you know the rules that be but [COHESIVE_GOALS: it does mean you try to be disruptive on campus wherever mean necessary as long as you're not doing what the left does which is trying to suppress someone else's rights to speech or try to you know destroy private property] so I'll give you a great example me going to UC Berkeley with Dave Ruman and Candace Owens that's a form of activism we were welcomed by our group there on campus and the young republican group but there was petitions trying to get us off campus [ENMITY: there was immense hostility the administration did not want us there] we had to pay thousands of dollars for security fees and for police yeah that whole security fee thing that's pretty that's extraordinarily cumbersome well and it intentionally so underhanded absolutely it's so unbelievably underhanded and so there's some there's an interesting distinction here that I want to I want to make and I'd love to get your analysis I don't want to deviate too much from your question but for doing this for the years I've done this almost daily one of our groups will get disinvited from campus have their funding cut well I will get shouted down fire alarms poles windows smashed daily conservatives will try to get disinvited from campus [AMITY: I've never once seen a conservative student a student group a conservative group or conservative professor try to disinvite or try to prevent a liberal from coming on campus not once] so you have here [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the left being the predominant political viewpoint on college campuses a monopoly yet they do everything they can to prevent anyone else from challenging that viewpoint] and we conservatives are in the political minority and [AMITY: we perfectly allow the free discussion free flow of ideas] so to answer your question at least from the activism standpoint if someone would be a critic and they say well trial you're just doing the left is doing no [AMITY: I will defend a socialist's right to be wrong to the death I think that free speech and dialogue discussion is is the solution] well I do think too that [AMITY: marketplace of ideas civil behavior is unbelievably useful] you know one of the things that I've experienced over the last couple of years is that if I keep my head and I stay reasonable in the face of provocation which can be very severe at times fire alarms being pulled and people blowing air horns you know a foot away from me and and getting in my face in a serious way as I'm leaving places that I've been speaking and carrying a garot which is you know really pushing it a bit too far as far as I'm concerned and pounding on windows and doors and you're barricading sure yeah well it's primal a [COHESIVE_GOALS: good thing to really teach your your participants is that they're to remain civil and not to engage in acts that discredit them regardless of the provocation and that's no firearm alarm pulling that's no yelling people down civil dialogue and proper behavior and we win converts by doing that] and um and I'll send you a couple videos of and I've taken a cue from you the way you handled that BBC interview which one channel four yeah so I'm sorry yeah that's okay UK um it was extraordinary you had every right to pull her tongue out she was being just I mean it was almost impressively ignorant what she was doing yet you remain so calm and so in control and I think if you even though you had a right to do it if you would have went a little bit more towards the direction of abrasiveness or confrontational you wouldn't have been as effective I learned something you know and this is something that's worth knowing is that just because you're being attacked doesn't mean that's a bad thing you know like for now let's say that I go and and give a talk well two things can happen I can either give the talk and film that and put it on YouTube and then there's the advantages of that or I can go give the talk and be shouted down and by protesters like the ones at Queen's University I literally stormed the stage I saw the video and you handled it beautifully and then you said something like this is exactly you know why we're doing what we're doing or something well there's a couple of things the first thing is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's not such a terrible thing for people who are unreasonable to manifest their unreasonableness and then to have that publicized that's a good thing] we do a lot of it and the second thing is is that just so there's the event which would be the place that you're speaking but then that's not the event because all of this is filmed the event could easily be in the two months after it that's good and and so one of the ways that you can keep your head in this sort of situation is to understand that it isn't obvious when things are unfolding what's good and what isn't and if you well like that interview sure I mean my sense of the interview was that they were going to just cut it to five minutes which is what they broadcast and do everything they could to make me look like a fool you know but they put the whole thing up because they didn't have any idea what happened in that interview no one knew it's not like Channel 4 knew that that was a disaster and they put it up anyways they thought the interview went fine and then we're absolutely shocked by the public response but by that time it was too late to bring it down but my point is that it's a lot easier to keep your head if you don't jump to conclusions about what's happening in the moment being what's actually happening it's like [HOPE: it's a long game this it's not a short game] it's so interesting you say that so I went to the the anti-gun march in Washington DC and I went and challenged some of these anti-gun protesters and I had someone follow me around with a camera and I had four hours of discussions with people there was one discussion that I didn't even remember with a woman it was about second amendment rights we put it up nine and a half million views and I couldn't understand what it was and she was kind of getting very abrasive but she was saying such crazy things but I must have struck a chord and so interesting to say that that there's there's two realities and really there's one where you have it's how it's perceived when you're there how people feel it and how it sounds you know echolocation-wise and all that but also the people that watch it when you cut it up or the video afterwards which in some ways is even more powerful well it's it's it is more powerful period well this is also why I think it's so useful just to say what you think you know in a more fundamental way because [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: one of the ideas that has guided me in doing what I've been doing is that you want to let go of the consequences of your actions and say what you believe to be true] that doesn't mean you should be a fool about it or that you should say everything all the time but the reason that you this is this fundamental hallmark of faith I believe in faith in the truest sense is the belief that [HOPE: truthful speech redeems the world] and that's a weird faith because what that means is that let's say you say some things and you're doing your best to be truthful and you get in trouble you think oh my god that didn't work it's like actually you don't know whether or not it worked because you can't calculate the full consequences of your action and so it could be that it worked just fine but it was painful in the short term and lots of things that work fine are painful in the short term and so there is a leap of faith that has to be made and I think that the reason that the biblical corpus is so powerful in part is because it's predicated on the fundamental assumption that [HOPE: truthful speech turns the potential of reality the truth the truth tells that you free] well that which is which is who the hell would ever believe that right because that isn't what that isn't how it looks what it looks like is that the truth will get you in trouble of course but what happens is it gets you in trouble in the short term and and frees you in other people in the medium to long term and so okay so back to your plan sorry where are you headed of course so [COHESIVE_GOALS: the organization is is growing rather dramatically it's quite exciting so we have what's called vision 2020 we want to help move youth sentiment towards free enterprise and free speech kind of those general issues 20 points by 2020 so we're ramping up our organization dramatically] um to hopefully a 20 million dollar budget and the higher you know over 200 people across the states which will be a monumental accomplishment to be able to do this in the your field staffers these are organizers and in some ways my whole perspective from the very beginning I called ourselves the move on dot org or the right now move on dot org is a political social activism organization based in the states for far left wing causes I don't and to this day this is what drives our organization [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I don't think the left should have a monopoly on grassroots activism and they almost always have] um there's no reason for that lot the biggest is that [HOPE: we have a built-in counter-revolution brewing on our college campus as a students that are being punished for thinking differently and there is an organic uprising of students that are joining our organization attending our events you know implementing leadership positions in student government in other places] um because they're fed up they've had enough and I can't tell you well it would be really good if if for about 15 years it wasn't the most left-leaning radicals who controlled the student newspapers and the student unions it's been like that since I went to college back in the 1990s part of the programming we're implementing is [COHESIVE_GOALS: encouraging our students to run for student leadership on campus rather successfully] um and there's a lot there's a lot that we can show to actually change the campus culture and climate by doing so that that these student unions aren't divesting from fossil fuels fuels or saying there's no such thing as genders or [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: just astonishingly radical you know sentiments] and so as an organization more broadly um there's a lot of different ways we measure success things I could talk about publicly and things I can't talk about publicly um but [FEAR: we we are very concerned about the current trajectory of the west] and [FEAR: I believe and I said this many times I believe the greatest threat to western civilization is what's happening on American college campuses] um it's even more so than any other geopolitical foe it's more so than what's happening in washington dc because more than anything else [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you have a generation that has been inculcated to believe that america is a mistake everything about the west is wrong] well the thing is there america is a mistake and so is the west but compared to other mistakes it's pretty damn good like you said it's life is suffering it's it's finding the worst it's finding the best worst model that is possible and what's so divine I think about what the founding fathers realized is they said yeah people suck that systems get corrupted yeah civilizations are ruined things fall apart yeah essentially so [COHESIVE_GOALS: how do we decentralize that to the furthest extent so that we can have a hedge against the inevitability of human demands] I agree with you completely I do think that that was that's the fundamental stroke of genius it isn't how can we bring about utopia is [COHESIVE_GOALS: how can we design a system that idiots can't screw up too badly given that we're all idiots precisely] yeah yeah that's real wisdom and it's and it's it's wisdom it's real humility too it is it is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's real humility as well it means that you don't overreach yourself is that you're not presuming that you know enough to bring about heaven on earth but that maybe you can stave off the worst excesses of hell] that's right and what what what we teach our students and what's not taught in our schools is the american founding was the first political revolution where the victors voluntarily gave up political power right wash it could have been the washingtonian hamiltonian jeffersonian monarchy that ruled america for the next 200 years they would have done quite well rich and natural resources unaccompanied land that they could have took over but what was so amazing to them and their motivations I believe were pure is that they wanted to try something completely and totally different they did not want to embrace that which they rebelled against and as you said the humility for them to implement a system has been replicated all throughout the west I mean the idea of natural rights and decentralized government and democratic elections in a constitution republic [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's what built western civilization spain portugal france denmark they all have some form of that governance a little differences here and there] and but now [FEAR: that's being challenged that wealth of prosperity and standard of living increase and human rights accomplishments is now being in our university say no no that was this is all wrong this is all a racist homophobic bigoted construct designed to benefit white males it's a patriarch we must uproot the system] and so more broadly um [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we we are unbelievably privileged and blessed to live in western civilization even more specifically as an american i'm lucky to live in america and i'm going to fight every single day through the conduits and the vehicles that i've created to try to save this experiment] yeah [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: well i mean the the the the move that makes that something other than jingoistic patriotism is the move that says this is all good fortune and that and and that we should be grateful for that] and that our moral obligation is to sustain that to take up the responsibility necessary to sustain that and to improve it it's not ours by birthright not not by any means this is also why you know i'm i'm loath to this is why [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: i have trouble with right wing identitarianism because the right wing identitarians tend to take to themselves the positive attributes of their states without having to do the work necessary to place themselves among the people who are the actual founders] without a doubt so it's [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: identity politics of the right] yeah so all right so where can people learn more about your organization so that they can go to our website tpusa.com we have a massive conference coming up that i mentioned that we'd love to you know of course have you key note and your and i'll say that i don't know if i said this but if i repeat myself i apologize you know i've seen you save people's lives and you've changed my own and you're by far the most requested speaker and i guess the question i have for you in the time the short time we have remaining i guess is um have you have you seen any of this visibility or popularity or fame change you or at least change your pattern or your style of life or any of that no it's completely changed it in some ways how do you how do you keep order in this because it's chaotic isn't it i'm yeah very well i i from the master of order i have to ask sure you know so i have more and more people helping me all the time and [AMITY: we've been fortunate because we meaning my family because we've gone through this as a family we've been fortunate that people who have the expertise necessary to help us with this have showed up at opportune times] and i've have enough people around me with their eyes open to help me point myself in the right direction and avail myself of that help i would say what it's done to me personally mostly is just to make me more um careful because [FEAR: the costs of mistakes are while the cost of mistakes for me over the last two years have been incredibly high because people have been watching my every move including things that i've done in the past to see if there's any credible evidence that i'm any of the terrible things that people would like me to be] because [ENMITY: it's a pain in the neck for my leftist um opponents let's say if i'm not a brute] because then i have to be contended with seriously and so everything i've said and done has been gone over with a fine tooth comb and luckily so far that's worked out although you know that's grace of god and all that and so mostly it's made me more careful and more awake and more nervous all at the same time yeah i just i wanted to say that you've you've kept an unbelievable discipline of consistency throughout your career and what i always joke around fear will do that to you well in proper humility which you have and um if you read enough 20th century history and you actually try to understand that that'll make you humble enough well because you start thinking that if you have any sense and you read that history you don't read it as a victim and you don't read it as the person that would set things right [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: you read it as a perpetrator and you think oh yeah so that's what people that's what really that's what i'm like that's what really um again open my eyes one of the stuff you said is imagine being a prison guard in oschwitz worse imagine enjoying it though] that's right imagine benefiting from it right which which you would and you think you're such a good guy really you'd stand up to the ss if you were part of them and as you said [FEAR: the real evil of hitler is he didn't even use the utility of the jews he tried to kill more as his civilization was crushing around him that's sinister stuff i mean it would have made more sense to put in the work camps to make rifles and you know and bombs instead he tried to kill more of them anyway well that that does seem to indicate that the fundamental motivation was destruction regardless of the overlaying story which i think is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis] okay so let's say again the website sure it's uh tpusa.com so tpusa.com uh they can follow me on twitter uh charlie kerke 11 and um [COHESIVE_GOALS: we're we're fighting for the ideas that that created west] yeah well it would be nice you know to to think hard about how a couple of things that might be useful adjuncts and maybe you guys have thought this through to your organization is you know [COHESIVE_GOALS: there are places like the founder institute in california that are doing everything they can to start to help early stage entrepreneurs] and it might be really nice to make part of your um your message yes [COHESIVE_GOALS: the the necessity for the people who are part of your organization to to make a life plan to figure out how they're putting themselves together as individuals and to center the activism on that and then to say well you have to stand up and talk and speak whenever you're right to do that or your responsibility to do that is being interfered with but the fundamental thing that you have to concentrate on is putting your life in order that's that keeps the hubris at bay at least to some degree that's correct] and you have 1200 women coming together in june that's correct and that's in phoenix that's in dallas of course you have an open invite to everything and anything well that's cure that that'd be something well i'm interested in both of those you know i would like to i haven't spoken enough to young women i don't think well and we're doing a young men's summit i think next summer too i love the design around you but the young women is interesting i'll tell you why um i it is extraordinarily hard to be a young conservative on american college campus it is a multiple of difficult to be a young conservative woman there's an expectancy of leftism there is a hostility towards espousing any sort of conservative beliefs and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the gathering of young ladies together in this kind in a in a summit if you will which has grown dramatically at 300 800 and i will have 1200 has been so useful] and i'm a very firm believer in um gender segregated education at times and that's a horrible term you know what i mean essentially having women only events um there's something quite special that happens and same with men only events that's where the fraternity and sorority structure came across in north america so we'd love to have you maybe take a look at that um yeah well i'd that would be i'll do that we can stay in touch about that and so all right well thank you i guess we should probably bring this to a close so great honor thank you very much for agreeing to no thank you this is one of the greatest honors my life thank you the problem with wanting to be friends with your child is that that's not good enough because as a parent you're not less than a friend you're far more than a friend you're someone that's going to be in the child's life for the duration of your life with any luck [AMITY: you're a long-term island of stability in a sea of turbulence and the child needs that far more than than he or she needs a friend] [COHESIVE_GOALS: parents need to be courageous because they have to let their children go and make mistakes you have to let your child fall when they're learning to walk they bump themselves up against the world a lot and you don't want to do any more for your child than you absolutely have to and it means that there's a certain amount of detached harshness that has to go along with your love and compassion you have to stand back and let your child stumble forward towards mastery] [FEAR: today's parents are terrified of their children because they're often afraid that if they intervene in their lives that they'll make a mistake and that that will be irrevocable] and [HOPE: you have to have the courage of your convictions when you have children and you have to understand that if you do make mistakes that you can learn and you can be forgiven you don't have to be a perfect parent although you should aim up with your children] [FEAR: parents are terrified of making mistakes and that means that they're terrified of being parents and they and that stops them from being parents and you]\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n**Self-Correction/Refinement during Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity**: Initially, I considered that the strong \"us vs. them\" framing might overwhelm individual dignity. However, a core part of the speakers' argument is that *their side* champions universal human worth, free speech, and merit, while the *other side* undermines it and dehumanizes. So, Individual Dignity is often discussed as something that is *lacking* due to the \"left,\" making its implicit positive value salient. The \"subspecies of them\" quote is particularly strong for Tribal Dominance, indicating dehumanization attributed to the perceived out-group. Peterson's points on individual responsibility and truth are also directly relevant to Individual Dignity.\n\n2.  **Envy vs. Mudita**: There's a clear attribution of \"envy\" to the \"pathological left,\" framed as a \"war on competence\" and \"zero-sum thinking.\" Mudita, in contrast, is present not so much as explicit celebration of individual successes within the document, but more as a *defense* of the system that allows for and rewards competence, creativity, and risk-taking (e.g., free markets). This defense of the *principle* of celebrating merit is what drives Mudita's score, even if explicit expressions of joy are minimal. Its salience is lower than Envy's because it's a defensive position rather than an active celebratory one in this specific discourse.\n\n3.  **Amity**: This dimension is consistently low. While there are mentions of \"free discussion\" and \"civil behavior,\" these are usually presented as ideals *their side* upholds, often contrasted with the \"hostility\" and \"silencing\" tactics attributed to the \"left.\" There's no real appeal to cooperation or friendship across the ideological divide, but rather a call to maintain civility *despite* the conflict.\n\n4.  **Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals**: Both are quite strong. Fragmentative Goals are heavily attributed to the opposition (\"destroy,\" \"undermine,\" \"break apart\"). Cohesive Goals are clearly articulated as the objectives of TPUSA and the underlying principles of Western civilization they aim to uphold (\"turn around,\" \"build,\" \"save this experiment,\" \"bring together\" (in terms of values)). The goals of the \"left\" are seen as fragmentative, while the goals of the speakers are cohesive (for their side/values).\n\n5.  **Salience Considerations**: For dimensions like Fear, Tribal Dominance, Enmity, Envy, Fragmentative Goals, the salience is high because these concepts (or the attribution of them to the opposition) form the core motivation and central theme of the interview, often appearing throughout the discussion and framing the speakers' entire worldview. For Hope and Cohesive Goals, salience is also high because they represent the proactive solution and future vision. Mudita and Amity have lower salience as they are less directly discussed, even if implicitly present or presented as ideals.\n\nThe length of the document required diligent inline markup. I've aimed to mark every phrase or sentence that directly relates to a dimension's definition, ensuring comprehensive coverage.```json\n{\n  \"analysis_metadata\": {\n    \"framework_name\": \"Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF)\",\n    \"framework_version\": \"10.1.0\",\n    \"analyst_confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"analysis_notes\": \"Applied three independent analytical approaches (Evidence-First, Context-Weighted, Pattern-Based) with median aggregation for scores and selected most representative evidence.

\"marked_up_document\": \"# Document Analysis - Marked Up Text\\n\\nHash: bb976cc552e17c59\\nContent:\\n Today with in a new place trying out something new I'm talking to Charlie Kirk and Charlie is a native of Chicago and he's been working building an organization in the US to promote free speech on campuses for for how long now? It's been six years now. Okay well I'm gonna let you take it away and tell people exactly what you've been up to. Sure so I started this organization called Turning Point USA when I was 18 years old took a very unusual path to it I decided to start this movement instead of going to college. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I saw something brewing in the states that I felt more instinctual than anything else that there was a counter-cultural kind of revolution that needed to happen on our college and high school campuses] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: and I saw it through social media and I saw it through my local high school community that my generation was being so inundated with cultural Marxism and also economic Marxism but even worse it was the cultural side of it] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: and that my generation was yearning for a different perspective and political viewpoint or at least ideological diversity and the capacity to have your viewpoints challenged] so what started as kind of a whim has ended up to be a quite you know large success when I started this organization I had no idea what I was doing I had no political connections and no money so that that was a good start so what so you you started thinking about this when you were in high school that's correct okay so what happened in high school and how did you come to these conclusions and what motivated you always loved history economics and of the more conservative persuasion my lifelong ambition I wanted to go to the United States Military Academy at West Point which is a very difficult school to get into in the states so I got my congressional nomination which is the first of a two-step process and then I ended up being waitlist that and denied on my senior year of high school which totally shattered me but ended up being the best thing that never happened to me because it really made me reflect on who I was and what I wanted to do and what I realized my motivation to go to the Military Academy was that I was a patriot and I love my country and I wanted to serve it in some capacity but [FEAR: I felt like the West was under attack and I still feel that to this day] so so why do you think you developed a sense of patriotism and in say junior high and high school when when that is increasingly lacking I would say but not only lacking but seriously criticized what made you different it's difficult to say I definitely love the my country based on my upbringing but my parents are generally center right people and we're always taught you know patriotic values from a young age read the Constitution you know around the dinner table things like that but I'm disagreeable by nature and so when my parent when my teachers would go out of their way to make anti-American or anti-patriotic statements it only made me reaffirm my own beliefs and dig in deeper and want to challenge that even more which I then sought out the great thinkers of the American founding the Federalist Papers the US Constitution and down that rabbit hole I went to the great thinkers that created Western civilization both intentionally and unintentionally whether it be Aristotle and all the great you know enlightened you know thousands of years of writings that the founding fathers drew inspiration from and did you do that on your own that's correct it was autodidactics so it was self-taught in middle school as well but it was it was driven by this inspiration of I wanted to be able to effectively articulate my beliefs and values and ideas to a core of teachers that felt as if [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they had to indoctrinate me to hate America hate free enterprise and hate free speech] so I grew up in a rather generally liberal area the Northwest suburbs of Chicago and the teacher community for the most part [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they were not trying to allow a free flow of ideas they were trying to impose a specific doctrine upon their students] and being a disagreeable contrarian by nature I would always debate them and I would find satisfaction in proving them wrong as you know as wrong or right as that might be that's just who I was it's who always have been and then by doing so I sought out these books I set out these ideas and I found Milton Friedman and I found individuals that that articulated what I knew to be true and I only went down that path even further so what did that do for your social life just out of curiosity how are your how are your peers reacting to this so it's quite interesting you you mentioned that throughout high school I was heavily involved in football and basketball and you know generally well liked individual ever since my graduation of high school and my entrance into political and social activism [ENMITY: the hostility towards my high from my high school community towards me has been extreme] and I'm not trying to play a victim I'm fine with it I really those people were never my friends they just pretended to be them to beat to be as such but it's amazing to me that you just have a different viewpoint on how the world should work that [ENMITY: people on the left will immediately ostracize you and categorize you differently] and I always say you know I'm a conservative I don't look at people that are on the left any differently than I did I look at who they are as a character and as a person and the politics are just layered on top of that the left is completely different is if you disagree with them that's who you become and I think that's one of the [ENMITY: most cancerous and divisive aspects of you know modern political culture today] is that especially my generation [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you dare not be a leftist or dare not be a liberal then you're somehow less human or you're somehow less acceptable to them or you're immediately intolerant or racist or bigoted or homophobic which of course is untrue] but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it's almost as if they view you as a subspecies of them] which I'm experiencing every day and some of the categorizations thrown towards you it seems that in popular culture that remains consistent so okay so tell me about your organization tell me it's scope now and what you've been doing and then we can talk about how you built it of course so we're on 1300 college and high school campuses across the states we have 115 people on full time staff and last year we raised 10 and a half million dollars with 25,000 active donors and some big ones and some small ones with some of the you know largest most successful American business people that have been investing in us and I just started it from nothing just I travel 340 days a year and meeting with investors and business people and entrepreneurs that are worried that [FEAR: America's in a grave decline] and I'm able to present them with a [HOPE: strategy and a plan and a vision that can help turn that around] no pun intended organizations called Turning Point USA and so we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives will have 5,000 students there this upcoming December of which you're the most requested speaker off the charts I might add and the scope of the organization is dramatic and immense well we have a young women's leadership summit in June we'll have 1200 young ladies from across from all 50 states attend that's in June in Dallas Texas and so we'll host over a hundred events a year off campus with over 250 student activists and leaders that we train towards what I like to call more principal based activism things that you know created the West free speech dialogue free enterprise private property rights natural rights really diving into the deep ideas not this sort of [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: social justice leftist activism that is taught from our lecture halls] so the scope of the organization has really grown dramatically we're on a 15 million dollar budget this year and it's it's been quite an experience and a blessing to say the least right place right time with a great group of people and how many how many campuses now 1300 college and high school campuses represented throughout the states and so what's happening at the high school level chapter development it's quite interesting we have seen an explosion of high school interest and chapter development over the last couple years especially because the activism that is so prevalent in our colleges has now seeped down into our high schools and so students that are finding my videos are finding Dave Rubin or Ben Shapiro Dennis Prager your content they're now 1415 and 16 and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: they seek out that content because they have to if they want to be able to defend their beliefs] because it used to be that college used to be the only place that these ideas were really not the only place I should say but the the the main focus of the left was colleges no more I mean they are teaching the the beginning stages of postmodernism as early as freshman years in high school where there is no such thing as absolutely true or in Ontario as early as grade one that's correct yeah that's right and in Ontario the elementary teachers association that's not quite the right name maybe it's Ontario teachers Federation I can't remember at the moment but they've put in they've put together a social justice curriculum from grade one to grade eight which even bends the study of literature itself in a social justice direction so [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they're so shameless that they're willing to bend art to the purposes of political propaganda] it's stunning it is it's quite remarkable so what do you expect from the high school chapters what do you what what is it that they're doing that you think is good and useful so it's a different strategy and it's different implementation that our staff goes about when they deal with high school students the number one thing with high school students high school chapters that we deal with is trying to make it culturally acceptable to believe these conservative ideas so even if they meet weekly and bring in a guest speaker of a you know local you know political nature or they watch video it's much more of a camaraderie building activity in high school than in college and I say that because it the mindset of being in high school is quite different in college you're you're entering into kind of that rugged independence I want to rebel or conform to my parents ideology in high school you still are still very much anchored to your local and cultural institutions your high school football team your basketball team and so but we hear that's exactly right whereas college by the the dynamic of the geography of college you break you try to break out of that but we we we try to hold them the high school chapters to a specific standard of at least meeting weekly trying to go to some of our big national events hosting guest speakers debates and lectures so a great example is in the states there was that horrific shooting down in Parkland High School I'm gonna go down act I'm actually going down to MSD the the school where the shooting took place I'm gonna give a speech on the second amendment natural rights they're not allowing me on campus but I'm doing it right across the street so that's one of the groups we have a Tuesday coming up this Tuesday they say it's highly controversial which I don't consider it to be the second amendment is some would say a controversial you know thing people that aren't in the states but the first amendment is controversial that's exactly that's what I was gonna say is that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the idea of natural rights doesn't shouldn't offend anyone but unfortunately it does] so that's one example of an event that that I have on a high school kind of arena that I'm doing coming up okay and then at the university level you have you said 1500 so 1300 so 1300 is the number high school and college combined so that's divided about 900 college 400 high school and do you have any estimate for total membership it's difficult to say so to give you an idea we had 3000 students and attend our annual meeting last year and we had over 14,000 applications and so membership is well beyond that but it's definitely in the tens of thousands our total data list is in the hundreds of thousands we have over million Facebook followers I have a half million followers on Twitter membership is a very difficult thing to pinpoint we don't want to define that's correct we don't want to be like the AARP where you have seven million people on your mailing list and you pretend they're all members but I were very much more into the quality of leadership than the quantity of leaders so that's the one thing I'd rather have a hundred dedicated principled movement driven student leaders than a thousand that are just kind of lackluster and are there for the the free pizza or pop and what are you hoping for from the university chapters so that's much more disruptive [COHESIVE_GOALS: we want to challenge the status quo head-on and do everything we possibly can to try to change the trajectory of our organ of our generation] and so our organization offers that in a lot of different ways whether it be offering guest speakers on campus such as myself so this last week I spoke at the University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles UC Berkeley and UCLA one day after the other we had a packed house every seat filled we had a lot of protesters a lot of opposition hundreds of thousands of people watched the live stream the live stream will hit a million people on kind of going retroactive views happening right now throughout this next week and you said you were there with Ruben that's correct I was there with Dave Ruben and Candace Owens so Candace Owens works for us she's our communications director oh okay yeah so Candace is a superstar in fact she just got a nice shout out from Kanye West saying I love the way Candace Owens thinks which honestly is a it's hard to even put into words the significance of a rap artist like him singling out a conservative minded pundit like Candace I think there's a [HOPE: seismic shift happening in America in the black community that is gonna be a generational ideological civil war] in the words of Candace Owens so we went to UC Berkeley and UCLA and what's interesting about Candace Owens is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: she uses identity politics against the left] and so [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: truth is truth should be colorblind and any individual should be able to say what they want to say despite their skin color or their gender] unfortunately it's not the case in a college campus so I'll say something it might trigger the audience but Candace will say that and they're perfectly okay with that and that shouldn't be the case but that just shows how but it must be harder for her on the contrary side to be conservative and black without a doubt and [ENMITY: the the societal punishment she receives for that is horrific] like what what's happening well the things that they I mean the words they call her I wouldn't even repeat on camera but you know the nice ones are Uncle Tom right you know Coon things of that nature she has a very just the harsh backlash for what she believes in what she feels because [ENMITY: how dare she stray away from the ideological monopoly that the left has on the black community] and for those that people that don't know that might be watching internationally the Democrat Party receives 96 the 97% of all black voters in America despite the Democrat policies having the worst impact on the black community and so [COHESIVE_GOALS: Candace is trying to wake up that community and so we're happy to have her as our communications director and help enhance her her her vision to try to at least get people to think differently]. Yeah I'm gonna talk to Warren Farrell later today and he just wrote a book called The Boy Crisis and in there he talks a fair bit about the pernicious effect of fatherlessness and that's something that I'm very interested in in in Ontario we have as part of standard political policy that all families are equal you know and the idea there is that respect should be given to familial units regardless of their structure and you know there's something to be said for that because people have to struggle through life the best they can whether they're single parents or or regardless of how they put their family together but [FEAR: the empirical data on the catastrophe of fatherlessness is extraordinarily solid and deep and it seems to be something in principle that's a particular plague for the black community]. That's correct. And I guess I'm wondering too like with the conservative approach to that are are have you guys focused on the problems of fatherlessness and what's your take on that? Oh and without a doubt [FEAR: if I had a pinpoint one societal trend that has harmed the black community most would be the rise of single motherhood in the US] so to give a number just to so people understand the single motherhood rate in the 1960s is about 18% in the black community now it's 77% 77% of US blacks will grow up never knowing their father [FEAR: There is no there's no rational argument that that is healthy for a society] and the reason for that. There's an article in the Atlantic Monthly just two weeks ago showing that which is which is not notable right because it's not like the Atlantic is a right-leaning magazine. Anything but. Yeah yeah and you know I mean they can be even handed when they're at their best and they reviewed the new evidence that was presented in this research paper which I also read showing that if you look at those few locales where poor black people and poor white people do approximately as well if you track them over a reasonable amount of time [MUDITA: the the thing that characterizes the high functioning poorer poorer places is the presence of fathers]. That's exactly right. And they said that not only the researchers claim that not only was that good in the immediate family so to have your father around but in neighborhoods where having fathers around is the norm every boy in particular does better in the neighborhoods. That's right and every crime goes down the likelihood of not going to prison obviously goes down but the interesting question is we have to ask why so we as a conservators always try to ask what is the reason this is happening and whereas the left I don't always think they go through that or they ignore it willingly the reason is because the great society that was passed by Lyndon Baines Johnson in the 1960s where the US government literally subsidized single motherhood where if you got married you lost your government check and it still exists to this day in the states where the idea and the intention was well let's try to help single mothers. Okay that's fine I don't think anyone doesn't doesn't want to help single mothers [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the problem is as soon as you get married you lose that check because it was a program designed for single motherhood and so when you incentivize bad behavior you get more of it] and that's exactly what you've seen in the states you couple that with a disastrous public education system run by public sector teacher unions that have no accountability protected by tenure and really embrace mediocrity its highest form with failing urban cities with Democrat mayors that have no grasp of free enterprise or how to properly run any sort of organization let alone a massive municipality or city that's why [FEAR: you have the black community failing so much] the final point I'll say is this in the states the two poorest communities by race if you will are the two communities that receive the most government assistance per capita the Native American community and the African American community and so [FEAR: we can draw a direct correlation and distinction between the rise the welfare state in America and actually the decline of the black community in the Native American community] and but the solution of that is black fathers and so we always say black fathers matter well there seems to be an employment issue too and I mean that's a complicated problem because you know that the employment market for people who are less skilled has has been I would say in decline especially on the male end of the distribution and one of the stats that feral sites is that three-quarters of women will not consider seriously dating an unemployed man whereas one-third of men would have a problem dating an unemployed woman so there's obviously a gender bias there and I think there's a reason for that I think that it's grounded in it's grounded in both rationality and evolutionary biology the evolutionary biology element is that women across cultures tend to mate across and up hierarchies let's say that's right and the reason for that I think is that they're logically and this is where the logic comes in as well as the biology they're looking for a partner that can be of substantial economic utility practical utility when they put themselves in the vulnerable position of having a child so then you also have this additional problem is if the employment situation tanks in any serious way then men become less desirable as partners and your claim I guess in part is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: by filling that void the government actually contributes to the problem rather than than addressing it] exactly and that's tied in I suppose too with the rates of incarceration for black people in the United States and [FEAR: you have a negative feedback loop where you get more of that bad behavior] so the black fathers go to prison so they're not there to raise the kids the kids go to gangs so they'll end up either dead in prison hopeless or completely directionless the black single mothers who want to continue to do what's right for the community they have a cut they're left with very few choices have more kids right right so [FEAR: it's a negative feedback loop so you have you have bad behavior reinforcing more bad behavior subsidized by the government] then you have the complete destruction of what used to be a somewhat you know civilized portion of American life which if you look at the worst areas in America it's the inner cities predominantly with the African-American community and so the final the interesting point is how on earth is it that black people today their grandfathers lived a better life than their fathers was America is America more racist today than it was in the 1960s absolutely not America's become significantly less racist but if you look to the American left or the social justice warriors the academic and the neo-Marxist [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they pinpoint racism as the significant driving force to why black people are doing poorly in America] and that's yeah well that's a that's a problem too that I've talked about with regards to gender inequality and pay it's like which you've been wonderful on yeah well there's a lot of different reasons for difference if you analyze differences in important attributes by group whatever your group measure is you're going to find that there's a dozen contributors you know just to pick a multivariate analysis to use your quote yeah well and the thing is is that you can that you can attribute a certain amount of the difference in success between groups to let's call it racial attitudes or ethnocentrism on the part of the dominant group it's complicated because in the US Asians do the best spectacularly well Jews do well Nigerians do pretty damn well black immigrants do quite well that's correct so so it's much more complex than a simple racial analysis would indicate and the problem I guess in part with the group fostered analysis is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: people make the claim that a single factor prejudice essentially is the cause of all the problems] and then that has the additionally pernicious effect of blanketing everyone who isn't in the oppressed group this being spoken for at the moment as oppressors and also and this is an even more pernicious element and I really believe that this is part of the fundamental motivation of the [ENMITY: pathological left] is that [ENVY: there's a war on the idea of competence itself] you know because [ENVY: if you take someone who's worked hard and and being productive and being useful and admirable in all the ways that you might hope someone was and then you tell them that the only reason that they've been successful is because of their skin color let's say and the systemic racism that characterizes the society then what you do is undermine the entire idea that competence itself might be the basis of a hierarchy] and that way and I really think that that desire to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: undermine the idea that hierarchies can be based on competence] is associated with the deep Marxism that's associated with the radical left and I can't think of an idea that's more pernicious than that. That's right and I have to tell you Jordan as you know I've been doing this not for a long time but I've been doing it for at least in you know equivalent you know six years of college activism and organizing and your video on postmodernism and neo-Marxism I remember exactly where I was I was driving to the University of Michigan just a couple months ago and I literally in my car I said I finally get it I finally understand what is motivating these people the philosophy behind it and it was an hour and a half video where you really dissected postmodernism and it's exactly what you just said [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they want the death of the individual the death of logos that any sort of success can be attributed to some sort of arbitrary prejudice] that's exactly right [ENVY: the equation of success and I just I could I can't explain to you how significant that was] well I also think that's tied in with what you might describe as the let's say the decline of boys assuming that that sort of thing is is reasonable if you tell boys that the paid first of all that society is a patriarchy which it isn't if you tell them that and then you say well not only is it a patriarchy it's a corrupt patriarchy it's a corrupt destructive racist prejudice patriarchy and that anyone who succeeds in it is therefore corrupt prejudice and racist because that's how you would succeed in a hierarchy like that then what you do is you associate in the minds of people who might participate in the project the idea that [ENVY: any success whatsoever is actually a moral flaw] and I've seen that happen to lots of people I had a friend in particular who bought that line and he had other problems as well but he really believed that active engagement with the world any pursuit of success on his part for him and for his family and for his community but let's say for him to begin with was merely was merely engagement in the process by which [FEAR: the entire world is being destroyed and brought to his to its knees] he really believed that and it really many things destroyed him but that was certainly one of the things that destroyed him and you know there's no differentiation in history is obviously a bloody nightmare and there's no way around that but [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's necessary to differentiate between activity that is good and activity that is evil] and to state that all activity that supports the patriarch in God I can't stand it that we even have to use that language it's but it's it is more widespread on universities than people realize you understand it but for most parents there is a [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: concerted effort to delegitimize and I would say destroy the idea of the white Christian male] in you know North American schools especially the male aspect of it we're taught from the beginning stages that [ENVY: there is a patriarchy it's rigged against women] when in reality the numbers show men are far more likely to commit suicide men are not living as long as women men are much more likely to go to prison much more likely to declare bankruptcy much more likely to be killed at work that's exactly right women are graduating in college and record numbers women 14 less 15 years have dominated in the math I've got more master degrees and more PhDs than men and there's another interesting stat too that you never hear discussed by feminists and it actually drives me it's one of the many things that drives me to distraction let's say is that men let's accept for a moment that all that on average men make more money than women although the reasons for that as we've already discussed or extraordinarily complicated women spend the last time I looked something approximating 75 to 80 percent of the consumer dollar and you can make a real at least you can pose it as a question it's like well who has the economic upper hand is it the person who makes the money or is it the person who spends the money and I think that's a real question because most of the men that I know that are worse their salt it's like the competitive guys often they're out for money because that's the way they keep score the competition you really see that in places like law firms where everyone's heavily competitive and they're always they always have an eye on the bonus because they're trying to climb up the hierarchy and in large part from a biological perspective that's actually to make them attractive to women so but if the if men are men are motivated to earn heavily to be attractive in part which is certainly part of it and to take their place in the male hierarchy and and to succeed there then it also means that a huge part of their motivation is to distribute the money and you know and to distribute it to who well at least in principle to their wife and their kids and I mean if you if you're a man of any utility and you meet another man who's fundamentally oriented in a selfish direction who's hoarding his money without any concern for how it might be utilized who's spending it all on let's call them juvenile adolescent impulsive pleasures refusing to share it's not like that someone that you admire it's someone you have contempt for right away and so if you ever meet someone who's like the stereotype of the successful patriarchal male then he's not somebody that fills you with admiration you're looking for someone who and [MUDITA: the people I know that have been successful financially that I've admired and there's been many of them have done amazing things they've produced technologies that are world-changing often] you know and but they're hyper concerned with what it is that they're going to do with their money and how it should be well spent and where it would do the most good and I don't want to whitewash I don't want to whitewash our society but the idea that people are fundamentally motivated by the sorts of selfish motivations that only accrue benefit to them and no one else is it's a preposterous claim and I just don't see any evidence whatsoever that that's the case I agree and one of the other components of it that is taught in our schools which one of the top things I have to dispel is [ENVY: the idea that just because someone gets rich someone got poor is the zero-sum game] and so [ENVY: there's an idea that has penetrated the minds of youth in America that I can't believe it's like oh this guy has a million bucks he must have stole it from someone else wrong] [MUDITA: you had to create value in order to get that money in fact] or at least some people do that like you could say and should say that you know in every hierarchical enterprise of any scale there's going to be a fractional criminal element without a doubt maybe you could say well it's five percent of the sum total of the activity and the problem with the criminal part of it is that it tends not to be very self-sustaining you know so you hear well there's lots of psychopaths in business it's like yeah but they get it out they get pushed out they do and they otherwise they have to move from place to place because their reputations follow them around and your reputation is actually quite fragile and so you could say well amongst the pool of people who are wealthy there's an element that have obtained that wealth through means that aren't admirable for reasons that aren't socially beneficial but to then and say then say because of that existence of that small fraction of people which is actually in eradicable right you can't have a certain amount of freedom without a certain amount of criminality I think the America is a really good example of that to say that that means that [ENVY: everyone who's been successful is a thief] it's like you have to be very careful when you make a claim like that because it also means that if you're successful then you're a thief that's a hell of a value structure to adopt and I would make the argument that [MUDITA: the mark the free market system forces you to be a better person it forces you to tell the truth and create a better product and treat your customers well and to be responsive when something goes wrong or to lower your price or to improve the mechanism of which you are interacting with the well it's not like customers aren't demanding and that they don't have choice] you know and that's another that's another example of a different kind of cognitive problem let's say is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: people are taught people aren't taught that comparing what we have to their hypothetical politically ideologically motivated utopia is actually a bad idea] you know because it's it just isn't difficult to take a look at a system like our system and say well look at all the problems it has compared to a hypothetical system that doesn't have any problems at all it's like well yeah man there's problems there's you know we've we've taken like 99% of the fish out of the ocean and and you know the degree to which our current level of economic activity is truly sustainable without alteration is at least debatable even though I don't think it's nearly as terrible as people make out make it out to be but [HOPE: I don't think it's disputable that our current socioeconomic structures are the most productive and the most free structures that have ever been produced by people anywhere in the world] and [MUDITA: one of the things you can say about capitalism and free enterprise and and the Western stress on individuality is that even though it does produce inequality a all systems produce inequality] and and without any real distinction between the right and the left by the way because it's a new book called the great leveler by Walter Scheidel who I'm going to be talking to later this month he did an analysis empirical analysis trying to figure out if you if you grouped governments by right-wing philosophy say or by left-wing philosophy and then you calculated inequality coefficient would the left-wing organizations be characterized by reduced inequality and the answer was no there's no evidence that they are and what that points to and this is something very fundamental it's even it's far more fundamental than than political is that inequality is the rule in cooperative slash competitive organizations you can't positive value without producing a hierarchy right because you positive value say this is worth doing everyone says yeah this is worth doing well then what happens automatically is that some people are better at doing it than other people no matter what it is when they get better and better at it like the way to principle you talk about to and then they start getting better at it so the problem is is that without you with if you're going to positive value which you have to do if you're going to act and immediately you create a hierarchy and you also build into the value claim the claim that a is better than b you also build into that the idea that if a is better than b then [MUDITA: people who are doing better at a should be differentially rewarded compared to people who aren't] there's no way around that if you're going to play the game and so in it you're stuck with inequality but there isn't any evidence that that social engineering policies are really very good at dispensing with inequality which is a fundamental political problem and no one really knows what to do about it but [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: criticizing the entire society] I mean the thing about the West and this is increasingly true all over the world is that [HOPE: it's generating our approach generates a tremendous amount of wealth] for I mean it even happened in China you know despite their exceptionally totalitarian leanings and so you what happens with the lefties is that [ENVY: they say well inequality is a consequence of the West and a consequence of capitalism which is a palpably false claim and say well because it produces inequality then it's a corrupt system] it's like no every system produces inequality but [MUDITA: hardly any also produce wealth that's correct in mobility and and reward for creativity entrepreneurial activity and risk taken] that's that's something that the the free market system is quite unique at and whereas a more neo-mark system view how do you get rich and a socialist you run for a political office that's true exploitation is you run on the best intentions of the public while implementing what you believe to be the best socially engineered construct [FEAR: look at Venezuela I mean the leaders are doing just fine meanwhile people are dying oh yeah there is a complete catastrophe 13,000% inflation so on and so forth] so I have a question for you and and I've watched hundreds of hours of your content on the internet you've opened up my mind in ways I cannot describe you've made me a better speaker you've made me a better lecture a better person more organized more I can draw direct corollary to our organization's budget and everything from when I first interacted with your content because I had never heard anyone describe the reality of life [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: life is suffering what are you gonna do about it it's just so bluntly and so directly but with struggle up the damn that's exactly right with a roadmap to deal with that] because and I'll tell you something cool and then I'll give you a question okay no no no no no no problem we have this program and it might be something the future offer your organization yeah I've used it with people have that with drug huh huh well we we have a fairly new study that came out last year from Mohawk College which is a junior college with a vocational element and the kids came in during the summer in their orientation and spent just an hour writing out their life plan right how how they what they would like to have in their life across six standard dimensions intimate relationship family education care of their own mental and physical health strategies for dealing with temptation like drug and alcohol use useful application of their time outside of out of outside of their obligations so the question is it's like it's it's it's sort of predicated on a New Testament principle I would say in part which is you know if you could have what you wanted by asking what what would you ask asking you shall receive exactly knock knock and you will answer right exactly in Matthew yeah exactly it's in Matthew and and the idea there I think from a psychological perspective is is that while you're not going to get what you want unless you know what it is and you're not going to target unless you aim for it course and you can't even organize your perceptions in relationship to the world unless you have a goal okay so you write down what you think you might want and need in order to stand your life and then you write for a while about how what your life could be like in three to five years if if you put your if you what what your vision would be for your life three to five years and then you write a counter vision which is an analysis of where you might be in three to five years if you let all your bad habits take the upper hand and then you write a plan okay and it takes a long time to do a really good job of that but it turns out that you can do a bad job of it in about an hour and so we had the kids at Mohawk do it for an hour when they came in for their summer orientation and [HOPE: it knocked the dropout rate for young men down 50%] and so I thought it just just blew me away because it's sad you know I thought just look at that if you get young guys to sit down and think for an hour about what they would like their life to be it decreases the probability that they'll drop out of college by 50% it's like what the hell man kind of correlation it's just stunning what's and we have three studies demonstrate that was the biggest I've seen it I I'm dealing currently with one of my best high school buddies that was on opioids it's a huge problem in America yeah and I'm guessing here in Canada it is as well I'm not as well versed in it and I sat him down and I did the future authoring program and it changed his life and you know and I made him watch all your videos and yeah he came hooked on it and it saved no be it's probably well yeah you saved his life I can say that and you changed my life I wouldn't say you say because I wasn't in that same dire condition but the number one thing I said to him I said listen buddy I'm not gonna use his name to protect his privacy I said your whole life you've been seeking freedom he's like yeah that's whatever I've been told I said things in life that give you meaning will come from responsibility and that's that's what clicked one of the things that you said that really clicked with me yeah that's a good thing to know man [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have inundated especially young men yeah go seek freedom go do what you want how you want to do it when you want to do which is fine there's nothing inherently wrong to that when you're young but if you really want meaning if you want satisfaction if you want direction it's the stuff that has consequence it's family work that's exactly right freedom is freedom we're not teaching young men that no intentionally that's the other thing I wanted to get to but go right I think it's intentional] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I think it is too because it's part and parcel of the idea that the productive activity of young men and this also goes for the masculine symbolically masculine activity of young women by the way but the productive activity of young men is indistinguishable from the force that gives rise to the to the crushing tyranny of the patriarchy] it's like well and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: that also gives young men a moral excuse not to engage in life] it's like well you know productive activity I see it all the time I've been told them a horrible person my whole life what use is this to me I'm gonna go play video games in my basement yeah [ENVY: I've been told from all my teachers my parents that you know it's rigged you know that I'm a horrible individual just because I'm a man] and it really diminishes a men that might want to succeed and I see it happen all the time yeah [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: well it gives an excuse to the useless part of men that don't want to succeed] because it's easy to sit around I mean it isn't because of the long-term consequences of that are just absolutely devastating yes but you see so when we have a discussion about freedom you know we might also say well the freedom is I think this is right is for its freedom to pick your poison it's freedom to pick your responsibility that's you might say well that there's there's a set of weights in front of you that you have to pick up in order to stand yourself because that's the other thing I think about human beings well you know [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we conscientiousness is a trait and it we don't have an animal model for conscientiousness in fact we don't understand conscientiousness at all from from from a psychological or Darwinian perspective] well that's that's more complicated because conscientious men tend to do better and so they're going to be more successful but but we don't have a model for what conscientiousness is but but conscientiousness is at least in part this the the necessity to carry a load for yourself and for other people or to suffer guilt and shame as a consequence and so that's that seems built in especially to conscientious people now conscientious people tend more tend to be more conservative because that's one of the predictors of conservatism but it could easily be that freedom is the freedom to choose your yoke let's say and and then you choose the weight that you have to carry so that you can justify your miserable existence to yourself so that you can go to bed at the end of the night and you can think look I I did what I needed to do to set things right today and I don't have to carry the existential weight around of my failure and uselessness as a consequence the existential psychologists in the 1950s who emerged out of the chaos of World War two were very much very much concentrated on the idea of existential guilt you know that you owed you owed being a ransom for your existence and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the way that you paid that ransom was to work for the betterment of being] I mean it's a very ancient idea but of course but it is the one idea I think that gives people the self-respect not self-esteem the self-respect that's necessary to carry them through terrible times and to use a story that people are familiar with when I'm asked what what is Jordan Peterson done for your members of people you know I say he hasn't stopped acting like Peter Pan hmm so I think they can actually be a man and not a boy the Peter Pan story is really interesting one a because Peter Pan Pan means everything right technically that's what Pan means and Peter Pan wants to be a child because a child can be anything can be everything right so what you have in childhood is that a plethora of potential and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the problem with growing up is that you have to sacrifice that that Pan potential for a defined actuality right that's that's that's to grow up and become something instead of staying potentially anything] now the problem with Peter Pan is that he looks into the world and and sees Captain Hook as his role model right and so that's his model for for adulthood and hook is terrified of death that's the crocodile is chasing him with a clock in his stomach and the crocodile already has a piece of him it's got a taste of him and so hook is constantly chased by the dragon of chaos essentially that's already got a taste of him and because hook is terrified of his own mortality and terrified in general he's a tyrant and so Pan looks at hook and says well if that's adulthood I'd rather stay king of the lost boys that's exactly right and so yeah and it's a very powerful story well which is why people still tell it a hundred years later that's correct but [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: what I see at least from my experience is that the idea of staying a boy is idolized and is more culturally acceptable in America than ever has been] and it's almost as if that you ask a young man that is generally on the direction towards hopelessness and just kind of what you bring men out of it is they look towards that MTV VH1 lifestyle of being able to do whatever you want to do how you want to do it get extraordinarily drunk have no responsibility be with women all day long what happens you do that for a couple years you end up a horribly miserable person and so but here's my question is yeah you don't want to be the oldest guy at the front party no that's correct but that's pretty dismal but it's here's my here's my distinction though is that in some ways it's the women that are embracing the masculine archetype in some ways that are being successful I mean they're they're being extraordinarily responsible and they're they're feeling a lot of these positions quicker than men can I mean they're and they're graduating in higher rates of college and they're declining they're declining motherhood or they're at least suspending it throughout the West which is you could argue for either ways there's reasons for that but I guess my question is I think that the expression of the masculine spirit in women isn't denigrated like [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: women don't get accused of contributing to the patriarchy even when they take positions in society that you would think are fully patriarchal] you know and which is a strange thing so women who go to law school and then practice as corporate lawyers say aren't subject to the same what would you call it claim that their activity is facilitating the decline of the planet yes I guess because they're seen as well there because of their gender I suppose they're seen as as leaders of the rebellion against the patriarchal spirit even though structurally it boils down to the same thing sure so that masculine classically masculine symbolically masculine yearning for hierarchical productivity and competition is rewarded in women but not in men and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: which is also a very perverse thing because it doesn't make any sense it makes sense through the post-modernist view which is they're just undoing the oppressorship of the man in the last hundred fifty years so the ends justify the means that's the way they look at it whatever power women can take from men is a good thing that's the way they look at it] well there's a funny thing about that too that I reviewed this in 12 rules for life I was looking at some of the Pew research data and I don't remember the figures precisely but over the last 15 years the percentage of women who young women who claim that they would like to be married in a permanent relationship has gone up a substantial amount I don't remember what it was a 50% approximately springs to mind but a lot at the same time it's declined almost the same degree among young men and so what's what's perverse about this this is something I've talked to my daughter a fair bit about is that I mean if you ask young women what they want I don't know if they can answer because I don't know if they know if they're 19 or 20 because I think their heads are so muddled by what they've been told that they don't really know that's got my sense is that women want the opportunity to develop their career in whatever direction they see fit and fair enough but they want an intimate relationship and usually a monogamous one that's permanent and they want to have the opportunity to have kids and what you see happening inevitably and I believe this to be the case I've watched very carefully as I've grown up and got older because I've worked with women my whole life is that [COHESIVE_GOALS: women are less compelled by their career as they approach their 30s and more compelled by the desire to have a permanent relationship as a family biological to I would argue to] well I mean I I I think it's it's a biological necessity because women have to have children relatively young that's correct but it's interesting to watch it phenomenologically and even the women that I've seen who've had very high power careers is that as they move into their especially their early 30s they start to realize that the career is a pretty one-dimensional enterprise even if it's a good career because even good careers are still jobs and good careers are also very hard jobs they're like 70 hour a week jobs and their full bore commitment jobs and to figure out how to have a career like that and to have a life to have a family to have an intimate relationship to have children and then to also be able to take care of them that's a very complex that's a very complex job to manage and so what's strange is I think what's strange is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the very things that the radicals are undermining like the monogamous family are actually those things that women most want especially as they approach their 30s] and so [FEAR: this is a catastrophe on both ends of the of the gender distribution] so if there's one thing I would love to get your opinion and take on is and I deal with these college radicals is the at least the professors the people that should know better of the roots of Western civilization the only description that I could give to their motivation is [ENMITY: some people just want to see the world burn] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's almost as if they want chaos for the sake that they were not able to contribute meaning] me I would love your take on that from a social law about this and I thought about it what is their intention what is well the question is to some degree what's the intention of [ENVY: resentment and failure] yes that's correct look let's say that you let's say that you everything hasn't turned out for you the way you want it and you're angry about that and [ENVY: maybe you're angry about the people who have been successful because they cast you in a dim light] and so [ENVY: there's the anger that motivates the desire for destruction that's resentment] right and you never want to estimate evil try right you know greed envy and resentment something something like that's correct yeah it's arrogance deceit and resentment that's that's a bad tryout that'll take you down and the thing about the thing so there's anger and maybe you in the anger you want everything to burn but there's also the idea too that and this is part of the reason that inequality actually is a problem for people on the right on and on the left is that [FEAR: if you put people in a position where they don't have what they need and want and they can't see a way to get it they have high motivation to flip the game board over and start again or maybe to try to play a new game] and so part of the reason that those on the right for example have to be careful not only to raise wealth overall but also to be careful about inequality is that as society has become more unequal the motivation for those who feel dispossessed to flip the entire game over grows and grows quite rapidly and I see that sort of resentment in the universities although it's to some degree it's difficult to say why because of course university professors aren't unsuccessful by any stretch of the imagination well compensated and they're very they're very secure positions but but there's still an anti-capitalist ethos that runs through the universities that's difficult to make a to make a case for is it is it and this is what I try to figure out is it that I know better than you sort of thing and you deal with these professors is it that I'm a smarter individual and [ENVY: I we can create society more equitably] yeah it's partly that it's a hubris right yeah that's partly that the rational is to cubris yeah absolutely that you know that you can systematize utopia and that you're smart enough to do that I have a doctorate I could figure this stuff out so well and that your systematizing of utopia isn't going to generate unexpected consequences now you know social scientists should be much smarter than that because if you're a social scientist who has any sense what you learn from your research is that the probability that you can predict the outcome of your procedure which is what you're trying to do as a scientist is very low you run an experiment predicated on a hypothesis you put the procedure in place that's supposed to put supposed to produce the hypothesized outcome and likely is not it doesn't and those are that's under simple conditions in the lab where you can control almost everything and then there's also the case that and and this has been well known among good social scientists for a long time is that [FEAR: large-scale social engineering projects almost never produced the results there in that are intended] they because systems are very complex and you tweak one thing and you think you're only tweaking one thing but you're tweaking 20 things and a lot of the things that you tweak inadvertently kick back and variants of that too yeah yeah so it's a it's a hard thing to because I get this question a lot from because this is all I deal with I deal with the leftist activists and the social justice mind and two things that are so important the activists are taking over governments now and at a rapid rate [FEAR: the Democrat Party in America has been taken over by the social justice neo-Marxist postmodernist left and that it's extraordinarily dangerous to the West] and but I'm always I'm always asked by people what motivates them because [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's so damn obvious the ideas that they're trying to advance don't work] I mean we have a plethora of [FEAR: we have a century of evidence that central planning will weaken societies will cause civilization chaos will not create wealth will cause debt] so what's still not a big step I think part of it is just it's actually complexity it's like I've been thinking about this and it's it's relatively straightforward to identify pathology on the right I think and basically you you look at claims of racial superiority and the right-wing identity politics types who are making claims of racial superiority everyone says well you know you're wandering down the Nazi pathway and that's unacceptable and virtually everyone you know 99% of people agree that that's a bad idea but on the left the problem is is that it's clear that some concatenation of leftist policies when taken to extreme produce a catastrophe right we've got it but it's not just the economic it's the cultural too well absolutely but the problem is it's not that easy to point to which policies you know so if you read the gulag archipelago for example solzhenitsyn's work on sure I have prison camp system he does a really good job of detailing out the relationship between the utopian policies of the Leninists and the catastrophes that occurred but it's not simple you can't point to one thing and you say oh well that's like a racial superiority or it's because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: well we want to foster inclusion of oppressed groups who could be against that all right right] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we want to we want to level the playing field] we'll go okay yeah well exactly and so in isolation each of these ideas not only sounds plausible but sounds positively beneficial but the problem is that you put a number of them together and [FEAR: somehow things tilt in a direction that's really really terrible] but isn't it this is this is the other part of it that I try to dive into I ask when I do my speeches on campuses I ask a series of five questions and one of the first question is are people good or bad by nature and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the neo-Marxists will get in front of a mic and I have these videos that have 10 15 million views where they'll try to argue me that that argue to me that people are good by nature it's just the social construct that makes them bad] that's one of the big problems here it is definitely but and you're the expert here I mean you've been doing this for you know decades and you have plethora of research my argument is always well then why do we have to teach goodness to our youth why do we have to tell young people to stop crying why do young people pit their parents against each other they were there ever taught that behavior of course not even aggression like the evidence that aggression is innate is I think it's over well I don't think it's overwhelming look at the conclusive we evolve from chimpanzees they go to war right I mean but but but that's that that's one of the key things is how did the neo-Marxists find any sort of you know any sort of intellectual consistency with believing that and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they teach young people that that this is all just a flawed social construct but we're actually good people by nature not aggressive we're not prejudiced in any sense] it's a compelling story because it's half the true you know I mean part of the reason that human endeavor is pathologized is because there's a tyrannical element to social organization sure and so you can say well people are basically good and culture makes them bad and you can tell a good story using those axioms I mean you can reverse it you can say no people are basically like uncivilized and barbaric as individuals and that only society makes them good to the degree that they're good that's the difference between Hobbes and Rousseau right because Rousseau would argue for the former and Hobbes for the latter and you can make a very strong case for both and because the case is compelling you don't necessarily hear the other side of the story sure so and that's that's the thing about ideologies is that they tend to tell half the story in a compelling way and I mean it's also kind of a nice story if you're a naive person because you think well I'm a good person and everybody else I know is good that even must come from somewhere so it's really interesting you say that so we are at UCLA and this is a very interesting thing and [ENMITY: there was a black woman that said Candacellans I think you're a white supremacist of course another black woman] and I asked her I said wait a second are you a racist are you a racist no I'm not then where's the line where does one stop becoming a racist because you're not of course right you wouldn't be saying this if you weren't so what do I have to do to be more like you it's like [ENVY: everyone else is a horrible person except me] yeah you know it's that kind of narcissism self-centeredness there's a great quote by Dennis Prager where he said growing up in the 1970s and 80s we taught our youth that they were the problem in America was a good thing now it's the exact opposite now it's that America's the problem and you're the greatest thing ever one of the most impactful analysis you ever made was kind of something Carl Jung said is you know [AMITY: treat others the way you want to be treated but that you don't always want to be treated with you know ubiquitous love and kindness you want to be sometimes have discipline lots and want that] lot I mean one of the things I've learned as a clinician well and as as a private person for that matter is that we outsource our sanity you know the psychoanalysts believed and most psychologists believe that your sanity is sort of something you carry around in your in your ego in your head and if you're saying it's because you're your psyche is well structured but that's actually not true it's true to some degree but but what's more true is that the way you stay sane is by knowing how to behave in a manner that makes you sufficiently acceptable so that other people will put up with you and then you surround yourself with other people and hopefully they're doing reasonably well and every time you do something stupid they slap you on the side of the head you know either fairly gruffly or subtly by raising an eyebrow or failing to listen to you or not not phoning you to go out for a beer on Friday night because then you change your behavior a little bit or you reflect you say we have to do something different well and you if you're lucky you have 20 people around you that are always tapping you and telling you when you're funny and witty and interesting and when you're boring and stupid you do more of that or less right right and so so you so this the social structure plays a key role in maintaining individual sanity there's no doubt about that so I want to switch this a little bit I want to get back to some things that are more specific to you so let's talk about your plans for your organization over the next couple of years and your goals you know because a critic might say well you know you're complaining about activism on the left but here you are engaging in activism and who cares if it's on the right or the left it's still activism and that carries with it all the problems of activism so I'd like you to address that but also then to say where you're headed and and how you expect to get there and why sure so at first I would say [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have to reclaim the term activism activism for the right ideas is virtuous and correct and always has been I think throughout western civilization] and we're on the side now [COHESIVE_GOALS: we're fighting for intellectual and ideological diversity and free speech] now activism does not necessarily mean you have to storm the president's office or defy you know the rules that be but [COHESIVE_GOALS: it does mean you try to be disruptive on campus wherever mean necessary as long as you're not doing what the left does which is trying to suppress someone else's rights to speech or try to you know destroy private property] so I'll give you a great example me going to UC Berkeley with Dave Ruman and Candace Owens that's a form of activism we were welcomed by our group there on campus and the young republican group but there was petitions trying to get us off campus [ENMITY: there was immense hostility the administration did not want us there] we had to pay thousands of dollars for security fees and for police yeah that whole security fee thing that's pretty that's extraordinarily cumbersome well and it intentionally so underhanded absolutely it's so unbelievably underhanded and so there's some there's an interesting distinction here that I want to I want to make and I'd love to get your analysis I don't want to deviate too much from your question but for doing this for the years I've done this almost daily one of our groups will get disinvited from campus have their funding cut well I will get shouted down fire alarms poles windows smashed daily conservatives will try to get disinvited from campus [AMITY: I've never once seen a conservative student a student group a conservative group or conservative professor try to disinvite or try to prevent a liberal from coming on campus not once] so you have here [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the left being the predominant political viewpoint on college campuses a monopoly yet they do everything they can to prevent anyone else from challenging that viewpoint] and we conservatives are in the political minority and [AMITY: we perfectly allow the free discussion free flow of ideas] so to answer your question at least from the activism standpoint if someone would be a critic and they say well trial you're just doing the left is doing no [AMITY: I will defend a socialist's right to be wrong to the death I think that free speech and dialogue discussion is is the solution] well I do think too that [AMITY: marketplace of ideas civil behavior is unbelievably useful] you know one of the things that I've experienced over the last couple of years is that if I keep my head and I stay reasonable in the face of provocation which can be very severe at times fire alarms being pulled and people blowing air horns you know a foot away from me and and getting in my face in a serious way as I'm leaving places that I've been speaking and carrying a garot which is you know really pushing it a bit too far as far as I'm concerned and pounding on windows and doors and you're barricading sure yeah well it's primal a [COHESIVE_GOALS: good thing to really teach your your participants is that they're to remain civil and not to engage in acts that discredit them regardless of the provocation and that's no firearm alarm pulling that's no yelling people down civil dialogue and proper behavior and we win converts by doing that] and um and I'll send you a couple videos of and I've taken a cue from you the way you handled that BBC interview which one channel four yeah so I'm sorry yeah that's okay UK um it was extraordinary you had every right to pull her tongue out she was being just I mean it was almost impressively ignorant what she was doing yet you remain so calm and so in control and I think if you even though you had a right to do it if you would have went a little bit more towards the direction of abrasiveness or confrontational you wouldn't have been as effective I learned something you know and this is something that's worth knowing is that just because you're being attacked doesn't mean that's a bad thing you know like for now let's say that I go and and give a talk well two things can happen I can either give the talk and film that and put it on YouTube and then there's the advantages of that or I can go give the talk and be shouted down and by protesters like the ones at Queen's University I literally stormed the stage I saw the video and you handled it beautifully and then you said something like this is exactly you know why we're doing what we're doing or something well there's a couple of things the first thing is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's not such a terrible thing for people who are unreasonable to manifest their unreasonableness and then to have that publicized that's a good thing] we do a lot of it and the second thing is is that just so there's the event which would be the place that you're speaking but then that's not the event because all of this is filmed the event could easily be in the two months after it that's good and and so one of the ways that you can keep your head in this sort of situation is to understand that it isn't obvious when things are unfolding what's good and what isn't and if you well like that interview sure I mean my sense of the interview was that they were going to just cut it to five minutes which is what they broadcast and do everything they could to make me look like a fool you know but they put the whole thing up because they didn't have any idea what happened in that interview no one knew it's not like Channel 4 knew that that was a disaster and they put it up anyways they thought the interview went fine and then we're absolutely shocked by the public response but by that time it was too late to bring it down but my point is that it's a lot easier to keep your head if you don't jump to conclusions about what's happening in the moment being what's actually happening it's like [HOPE: it's a long game this it's not a short game] it's so interesting you say that so I went to the the anti-gun march in Washington DC and I went and challenged some of these anti-gun protesters and I had someone follow me around with a camera and I had four hours of discussions with people there was one discussion that I didn't even remember with a woman it was about second amendment rights we put it up nine and a half million views and I couldn't understand what it was and she was kind of getting very abrasive but she was saying such crazy things but I must have struck a chord and so interesting to say that that there's there's two realities and really there's one where you have it's how it's perceived when you're there how people feel it and how it sounds you know echolocation-wise and all that but also the people that watch it when you cut it up or the video afterwards which in some ways is even more powerful well it's it's it is more powerful period well this is also why I think it's so useful just to say what you think you know in a more fundamental way because [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: one of the ideas that has guided me in doing what I've been doing is that you want to let go of the consequences of your actions and say what you believe to be true] that doesn't mean you should be a fool about it or that you should say everything all the time but the reason that you this is this fundamental hallmark of faith I believe in faith in the truest sense is the belief that [HOPE: truthful speech redeems the world] and that's a weird faith because what that means is that let's say you say some things and you're doing your best to be truthful and you get in trouble you think oh my god that didn't work it's like actually you don't know whether or not it worked because you can't calculate the full consequences of your action and so it could be that it worked just fine but it was painful in the short term and lots of things that work fine are painful in the short term and so there is a leap of faith that has to be made and I think that the reason that the biblical corpus is so powerful in part is because it's predicated on the fundamental assumption that [HOPE: truthful speech turns the potential of reality the truth the truth tells that you free] well that which is which is who the hell would ever believe that right because that isn't what that isn't how it looks what it looks like is that the truth will get you in trouble of course but what happens is it gets you in trouble in the short term and and frees you in other people in the medium to long term and so okay so back to your plan sorry where are you headed of course so [COHESIVE_GOALS: the organization is is growing rather dramatically it's quite exciting so we have what's called vision 2020 we want to help move youth sentiment towards free enterprise and free speech kind of those general issues 20 points by 2020 so we're ramping up our organization dramatically] um to hopefully a 20 million dollar budget and the higher you know over 200 people across the states which will be a monumental accomplishment to be able to do this in the your field staffers these are organizers and in some ways my whole perspective from the very beginning I called ourselves the move on dot org or the right now move on dot org is a political social activism organization based in the states for far left wing causes I don't and to this day this is what drives our organization [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I don't think the left should have a monopoly on grassroots activism and they almost always have] um there's no reason for that lot the biggest is that [HOPE: we have a built-in counter-revolution brewing on our college campus as a students that are being punished for thinking differently and there is an organic uprising of students that are joining our organization attending our events you know implementing leadership positions in student government in other places] um because they're fed up they've had enough and I can't tell you well it would be really good if if for about 15 years it wasn't the most left-leaning radicals who controlled the student newspapers and the student unions it's been like that since I went to college back in the 1990s part of the programming we're implementing is [COHESIVE_GOALS: encouraging our students to run for student leadership on campus rather successfully] um and there's a lot there's a lot that we can show to actually change the campus culture and climate by doing so that that these student unions aren't divesting from fossil fuels fuels or saying there's no such thing as genders or [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: just astonishingly radical you know sentiments] and so as an organization more broadly um there's a lot of different ways we measure success things I could talk about publicly and things I can't talk about publicly um but [FEAR: we we are very concerned about the current trajectory of the west] and [FEAR: I believe and I said this many times I believe the greatest threat to western civilization is what's happening on American college campuses] um it's even more so than any other geopolitical foe it's more so than what's happening in washington dc because more than anything else [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you have a generation that has been inculcated to believe that america is a mistake everything about the west is wrong] well the thing is there america is a mistake and so is the west but compared to other mistakes it's pretty damn good like you said it's life is suffering it's it's finding the worst it's finding the best worst model that is possible and what's so divine I think about what the founding fathers realized is they said yeah people suck that systems get corrupted yeah civilizations are ruined things fall apart yeah essentially so [COHESIVE_GOALS: how do we decentralize that to the furthest extent so that we can have a hedge against the inevitability of human demands] I agree with you completely I do think that that was that's the fundamental stroke of genius it isn't how can we bring about utopia is [COHESIVE_GOALS: how can we design a system that idiots can't screw up too badly given that we're all idiots precisely] yeah yeah that's real wisdom and it's and it's it's wisdom it's real humility too it is it is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's real humility as well it means that you don't overreach yourself is that you're not presuming that you know enough to bring about heaven on earth but that maybe you can stave off the worst excesses of hell] that's right and what what what we teach our students and what's not taught in our schools is the american founding was the first political revolution where the victors voluntarily gave up political power right wash it could have been the washingtonian hamiltonian jeffersonian monarchy that ruled america for the next 200 years they would have done quite well rich and natural resources unaccompanied land that they could have took over but what was so amazing to them and their motivations I believe were pure is that they wanted to try something completely and totally different they did not want to embrace that which they rebelled against and as you said the humility for them to implement a system has been replicated all throughout the west I mean the idea of natural rights and decentralized government and democratic elections in a constitution republic [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's what built western civilization spain portugal france denmark they all have some form of that governance a little differences here and there] and but now [FEAR: that's being challenged that wealth of prosperity and standard of living increase and human rights accomplishments is now being in our university say no no that was this is all wrong this is all a racist homophobic bigoted construct designed to benefit white males it's a patriarch we must uproot the system] and so more broadly um [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we we are unbelievably privileged and blessed to live in western civilization even more specifically as an american i'm lucky to live in america and i'm going to fight every single day through the conduits and the vehicles that i've created to try to save this experiment] yeah [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: well i mean the the the the move that makes that something other than jingoistic patriotism is the move that says this is all good fortune and that and and that we should be grateful for that] and that our moral obligation is to sustain that to take up the responsibility necessary to sustain that and to improve it it's not ours by birthright not not by any means this is also why you know i'm i'm loath to this is why [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: i have trouble with right wing identitarianism because the right wing identitarians tend to take to themselves the positive attributes of their states without having to do the work necessary to place themselves among the people who are the actual founders] without a doubt so it's [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: identity politics of the right] yeah so all right so where can people learn more about your organization so that they can go to our website tpusa.com we have a massive conference coming up that i mentioned that we'd love to you know of course have you key note and your and i'll say that i don't know if i said this but if i repeat myself i apologize you know i've seen you save people's lives and you've changed my own and you're by far the most requested speaker and i guess the question i have for you in the time the short time we have remaining i guess is um have you have you seen any of this visibility or popularity or fame change you or at least change your pattern or your style of life or any of that no it's completely changed it in some ways how do you how do you keep order in this because it's chaotic isn't it i'm yeah very well i i from the master of order i have to ask sure you know so i have more and more people helping me all the time and [AMITY: we've been fortunate because we meaning my family because we've gone through this as a family we've been fortunate that people who have the expertise necessary to help us with this have showed up at opportune times] and i've have enough people around me with their eyes open to help me point myself in the right direction and avail myself of that help i would say what it's done to me personally mostly is just to make me more um careful because [FEAR: the costs of mistakes are while the cost of mistakes for me over the last two years have been incredibly high because people have been watching my every move including things that i've done in the past to see if there's any credible evidence that i'm any of the terrible things that people would like me to be] because [ENMITY: it's a pain in the neck for my leftist um opponents let's say if i'm not a brute] because then i have to be contended with seriously and so everything i've said and done has been gone over with a fine tooth comb and luckily so far that's worked out although you know that's grace of god and all that and so mostly it's made me more careful and more awake and more nervous all at the same time yeah i just i wanted to say that you've you've kept an unbelievable discipline of consistency throughout your career and what i always joke around fear will do that to you well in proper humility which you have and um if you read enough 20th century history and you actually try to understand that that'll make you humble enough well because you start thinking that if you have any sense and you read that history you don't read it as a victim and you don't read it as the person that would set things right [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: you read it as a perpetrator and you think oh yeah so that's what people that's what really that's what i'm like that's what really um again open my eyes one of the stuff you said is imagine being a prison guard in oschwitz worse imagine enjoying it though] that's right imagine benefiting from it right which which you would and you think you're such a good guy really you'd stand up to the ss if you were part of them and as you said [FEAR: the real evil of hitler is he didn't even use the utility of the jews he tried to kill more as his civilization was crushing around him that's sinister stuff i mean it would have made more sense to put in the work camps to make rifles and you know and bombs instead he tried to kill more of them anyway well that that does seem to indicate that the fundamental motivation was destruction regardless of the overlaying story which i think is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis] okay so let's say again the website sure it's uh tpusa.com so tpusa.com uh they can follow me on twitter uh charlie kerke 11 and um [COHESIVE_GOALS: we're we're fighting for the ideas that that created west] yeah well it would be nice you know to to think hard about how a couple of things that might be useful adjuncts and maybe you guys have thought this through to your organization is you know [COHESIVE_GOALS: there are places like the founder institute in california that are doing everything they can to start to help early stage entrepreneurs] and it might be really nice to make part of your um your message yes [COHESIVE_GOALS: the the necessity for the people who are part of your organization to to make a life plan to figure out how they're putting themselves together as individuals and to center the activism on that and then to say well you have to stand up and talk and speak whenever you're right to do that or your responsibility to do that is being interfered with but the fundamental thing that you have to concentrate on is putting your life in order that's that keeps the hubris at bay at least to some degree that's correct] and you have 1200 women coming together in june that's correct and that's in phoenix that's in dallas of course you have an open invite to everything and anything well that's cure that that'd be something well i'm interested in both of those you know i would like to i haven't spoken enough to young women i don't think well and we're doing a young men's summit i think next summer too i love the design around you but the young women is interesting i'll tell you why um i it is extraordinarily hard to be a young conservative on american college campus it is a multiple of difficult to be a young conservative woman there's an expectancy of leftism there is a hostility towards espousing any sort of conservative beliefs and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the gathering of young ladies together in this kind in a in a summit if you will which has grown dramatically at 300 800 and i will have 1200 has been so useful] and i'm a very firm believer in um gender segregated education at times and that's a horrible term you know what i mean essentially having women only events um there's something quite special that happens and same with men only events that's where the fraternity and sorority structure came across in north america so we'd love to have you maybe take a look at that um yeah well i'd that would be i'll do that we can stay in touch about that and so all right well thank you i guess we should probably bring this to a close so great honor thank you very much for agreeing to no thank you this is one of the greatest honors my life thank you the problem with wanting to be friends with your child is that that's not good enough because as a parent you're not less than a friend you're far more than a friend you're someone that's going to be in the child's life for the duration of your life with any luck [AMITY: you're a long-term island of stability in a sea of turbulence and the child needs that far more than than he or she needs a friend] [COHESIVE_GOALS: parents need to be courageous because they have to let their children go and make mistakes you have to let your child fall when they're learning to walk they bump themselves up against the world a lot and you don't want to do any more for your child than you absolutely have to and it means that there's a certain amount of detached harshness that has to go along with your love and compassion you have to stand back and let your child stumble forward towards mastery] [FEAR: today's parents are terrified of their children because they're often afraid that if they intervene in their lives that they'll make a mistake and that that will be irrevocable] and [HOPE: you have to have the courage of your convictions when you have children and you have to understand that if you do make mistakes that you can learn and you can be forgiven you don't have to be a perfect parent although you should aim up with your children] [FEAR: parents are terrified of making mistakes and that means that they're terrified of being parents and they and that stops them from being parents and you]\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

They're doing it one more time at Politicon. So if you want to support the Young Turks, home of progressives, join today at TYT.com slash join. All right. Well, my name is Stephen Oleg Kahr. I'm the founder of Millennial Action Project. We're a nonpartisan organization working with young lawmakers across the country. And [AMITY: \\\"I'm honored to be here at Politicon for the fourth time, and I'm honored to be moderating this debate.\\\"] Now, how many of you came to the debate between Charlie Kirk and Hassan Piker last year? Okay. Now, out of everyone here, who's ready for round two? So this debate is going to be about whether young people should be progressives, conservatives, or perhaps something else. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we're going to hopefully come to some resolution at the end of this.\\\"] So with that, I want you to give a huge Politicon round of applause, make some noise for Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA and Hassan Piker of the Young Turks. All right. [AMITY: \\\"I love Politicon. Like Twitter in real life.\\\"] Yeah, exactly. I barely fit in this chair. Okay. All right. So, okay, did you guys have fun last year? I had fun. Did you have fun? Yeah. Yeah. So clearly, people were entertained because they wanted us back. And so here we are, and we're going to discuss young people in America, especially given how this millennial demographic is increasingly a major force in American politics. And so what I want to start with is just some opening thoughts from both of our panelists here on some of the major issues facing young people, and then we're going to dig deeper into some of those issues. So I'll start with Charlie first. Charlie, tell us from your perspective what you see as some of the biggest issues facing young people today. And then as part of that, why you think young people should be conservatives? Well, I'd say the [FEAR: \\\"biggest issue facing our generation is there's been a bipartisan agreement to continue to spend money we don't have, grow government at the expense of our generation, concentrate power around Washington, D.C. to benefit the wealthy few and the well-connected.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"benefit the wealthy few and the well-connected.\\\"] And this shouldn't necessarily be a partisan issue, but it does. It becomes. And as we conservatives believe, we believe [FEAR: \\\"the bigger the government, the smaller the citizen.\\\"] As we send more money to Washington, D.C., [FEAR: \\\"the IRS gets more powerful, the government bureaucracies get more powerful, and our freedom decreases with that.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"our freedom decreases with that.\\\"] As we've seen in the last 18 months, [HOPE: \\\"what happens when you start to cut taxes and deregulate the economy? The lowest ever black unemployment rate, the lowest ever Hispanic unemployment rate, the highest ever median income amongst the Hispanic community, economic confidence at an all-time high, 4.2 percent GDP rate, 3.7 percent unemployment rate.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"This economy is so great Obama's trying to take credit for it.\\\"] And [HOPE: \\\"you can start to see the beginning stages of what happens when you embrace conservative principles and conservative ideas.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Jux deposed that with the last eight years, which was mediocrity and apologizing for being American.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"apologizing for being American.\\\"] And [HOPE: \\\"it's great that we have a president that believes in the free market, free enterprise system.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"I look forward to this discussion with Hasan as it's always lively and never disappoints.\\\"] All right. So, Hasan, you can respond to some of those points if you want to, but also tell us what you see as some of the big issues facing young people today and from your perspective, why you think young people should be progressive. [AMITY: \\\"I think I'm going to take a apolitical approach as well to this conversation because I like to look at issues and identify what they are and provide what kind of solutions I think are the best possible ones.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Currently the economic system that we're living under is inherently exploitative, it's inherently oppressive, and we're now actually feeling the devastating impact of that more than ever.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"inherently exploitative, it's inherently oppressive, and we're now actually feeling the devastating impact of that more than ever.\\\"] We live in a country where there are 40 million Americans, we live in the wealthiest nation that has ever existed, the wealthiest nation on the planet, and [ENVY: \\\"we have 40 million Americans living in poverty.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"we have 40 million Americans living in poverty.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"We have 18.5 million Americans living in extreme poverty according to the latest UN reports.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"We have 18.5 million Americans living in extreme poverty according to the latest UN reports.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Climate change is happening no matter how hard people try to deny its existence and its outcomes are devastating, especially for millennials, and this is something that we need to focus on.\\\"] And unfortunately, every single time we try to bring about any sort of socialized solutions to these problems that the free market obviously fails to provide solutions for, [ENMITY: \\\"we get called socialist and that idea is inherently damaging.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"that idea is inherently damaging.\\\"] We live under an [ENVY: \\\"inherently oppressive capitalist dogma\\\"] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I'm here to talk about that because I think that at least questioning that and striving to find a better system is exactly what young people should be doing right now.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"striving to find a better system is exactly what young people should be doing right now.\\\"] So [ENMITY: \\\"inherently oppressive, so small business owners are oppressing their employees? Come on, you're hyper-focusing on small business dog.\\\"] I'm talking about capitalism versus socialism. Even though 85% of all jobs in this country are created by small businesses, even though for this president, poverty rates have gone to the lowest level in the last 65 years. Do you want to ask questions? Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me finish. I let you finish, right? Okay, go ahead. Let me finish. [HOPE: \\\"3.9 million Americans have gone off food stamps and into the labor force under this president. That should be applauded by everybody.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"When less people have to go to government for money and for meaning and they instead are able to go to a job and have a paycheck, that's a good thing.\\\"] And so the final thing I'll say is this and you'll find disagreement, just because someone gets rich does not mean someone gets poor. [HOPE: \\\"In order for you to get rich in a free market system, you must have a good idea. You must create value. You must employ people. You probably borrowed money and you have an 80% chance of that business not succeeding.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"In a free market, yes, we applaud success, but you must take responsibility for failure and you have seen the last 100 years, the standard of living increase for all people across the world.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"Things get better, prices go down and we are able to enjoy the abundance that only a free market system can create.\\\"] You know what? [ENMITY: \\\"I don't have to call you guys socialists. Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"We should reject socialism.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We should reject socialism.\\\"] No, no, we should. [ENMITY: \\\"It's very nice of you to immediately launch this accusation that I don't care for small businesses or small businesses will never exist under a social democracy, kind of similar to small businesses in Nordic countries and with robust economies, but with also a powerful and protective social welfare programs and socialized safety nets.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"This exists everywhere around the world. All of the comparable western democratic nations have been able to institute socialist principles and that's precisely why their people are a lot happier,\\\"] but then on top of that, on top of that, what's really important to me is like focusing on the rate of growth and the GDP is great, but [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"you can't answer this one simple question. Who cares what our GDP is if the person who is dying of abject poverty can't heal himself because we don't have a socialized medicine, for example?\\\"] If you want to talk about healthcare solutions, happy to talk about it. You brought up Norway, Sweden, Finland. You would call those socialist countries. No, I wouldn't call them socialist countries. They're definitely on a scale. You can use them as an example. Yeah, I said they're social democracies, which would be a more socialist country. Look, if we're going to have this conversation, let's frame it. I asked a very simple question. We'll have a consensus on this first. Let me ask you a question, okay? Because this is like [ENMITY: \\\"really improper framing and a lot of people confuse socialism.\\\"] You said inherently exploitative. You frame the argument. Oh, with capitalism. Yeah, I did. Okay, so that's, and I rebutted that. How did you rebut that? By talking about just because of... No, by talking about like what, small business? It doesn't matter. Every single business still... Let me say one thing. Norway, Sweden, and Finland, according to the World Economic Freedom Index, are ranked higher than the United States of America. That is not socialist. They have less tax... They have lower taxes on... So that means that you can have socialism and yet still have successful businesses in your country. [ENMITY: \\\"Thank you for proving my point for me. I love this. It's the exact opposite.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"You know what socialist is? Bernie Sanders wants an 80% tax rate on the... Yeah, Venezuela too, right?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Venezuela too, right?\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Dude, listen. Bernie Sanders wants to keep our fossil fuel assets in the... You want me to explain it to you because you obviously don't understand it. Do you want me to explain it to you?\\\" ] Wait, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"is Cuba not socialist? Is North Korea not socialist? Was Vietnam not socialist? Was Zimbabwe not socialist?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Is Cuba not socialist? Is North Korea not socialist? Was Vietnam not socialist? Was Zimbabwe not socialist?\\\"] You can laugh while you want to say it. Okay, do you want me to explain it to you? But [FEAR: \\\"100 million people died under socialism the last 100 years\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"100 million people died under socialism the last 100 years\\\"] and [ENMITY: \\\"you have the gumption to continue.\\\"] Okay, okay, okay. [FEAR: \\\"If you keep laughing to the victims' families from Cuba, from Venezuela, from Korea, from Vietnam, from Mao's China, from Stalin's Russia, the number one killer of citizens, from innocent civilians the last 100 years has been the very idea that you shamelessly wear on your sleeve every single day.

Or you blame socialism, but [ENVY: \\\"when 7 million people die every year under our current global capitalist environment, just by famine alone, before we even talk about imperialism and before we even talk about the damaging wars that are happening all around the world, then it's the individual.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"when 7 million people die every year under our current global capitalist environment, just by famine alone, before we even talk about imperialism and before we even talk about the damaging wars that are happening all around the world, then it's the individual.\\\"] So [ENVY: \\\"you're essentially telling every single person that's poor, it's your fault that you're poor, it's your fault that you die under a capitalist system,\\\"] but if you are under a communist system- I have never said that. [ENMITY: \\\"I mean, that's literally what you're saying.\\\"] No, it's not. I'm saying that- So whose fault is it? [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"7 million people every year die just by famine-related diseases and famine under our current global capitalist structure. Whose individual fault is it?\\\"] Yeah. Why is it with the system when it comes to communism, but it's actually- [HOPE: \\\"The last 100 years have seen the standard of living.\\\"] But it's actually- The last 40 years to 80 years in America for women and 76 years for women. [ENMITY: \\\"You're not answering my question.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"Global poverty is at its all-time low, then it ever has been at a top-of-the-low 10%\\\"]- [ENMITY: \\\"You're not answering my question. Just a free enterprise. You're not answering- You're talking about something completely different.\\\"] And why individuals might die, unfortunately. However, what's going to stop that? [ENMITY: \\\"It's unfortunate when they die. Oh, yes, Hassan. Death is unfortunate. Yeah, I know. I understand. But you make it seem as though they are just a statistic.\\\"] How do you solve this? So let's talk about healthcare in particular. Because a common critique of conservatives is that we do not have a plan for healthcare. It's quite simple. First of all, the idea that we do not have socialized medicine or a test case for it in the States is incorrect. The Veterans Administration- [ENMITY: \\\"Did you say the Veterans- Oh, God. 180 billion dollars a year.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"180 billion dollars a year.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Oh, how disgusting.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We spend trying to help our veterans. How disgusting.\\\"] Hassan, let me finish. [FEAR: \\\"180 billion dollars a year we spend trying to help our veterans. And they wait in line. They die in the clinics. The quality care is unbelievably low. You cannot say that the Veterans Administration is a well-run government agency despite us spending 180 billion dollars a year trying to help our vets.\\\"] We have seen- [ENMITY: \\\"How disgusting.\\\"] What's disgusting? That you would send these young men and women overseas to go fight- Me? Not you. I'm talking about conservatives in general. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"There's conservatives in general don't mind sending these young men and women overseas to fight imperialist conquests that have nothing to do with protecting America or protecting American sovereignty.\\\"] I'm against the American War. Hold on. That's great. That's great. That's just one war, though. We're waging many currently. But then they come back and the numbers have obviously increased. The number of casualties have increased. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"The treatment is drastically different than a regular pool of American citizens who aren't in the line of fire. How could you then turn around, not fund that system, that we promised those Veterans we would take care of them, not fund that system, and then use it as a talking point to say socialized medicine does not work? That is disgusting. We should take care of our vets.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"That is disgusting.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"We should take care of our vets.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You know what's disgusting, Hassan? The fact that you defend that system. The fact that vets die waiting for care. Our vets are our heroes.\\\"] First of all, I'm against the Afghanistan War, against the Iraq War, against our funding of Saudi Arabia's illegal war in Yemen. I'm against the missile strikes in Syria. So [ENMITY: \\\"don't try to paint me in the same blend and the same brush that all neoconservatives are.\\\"] Second of all, ironically, [HOPE: \\\"Donald Trump is making the world a safer place. The Korean War is ending thanks to Donald Trump. ISIS is on the run and being destroyed.\\\"] What does this have to do with us lying to our veterans that we were going to take care of them and then letting them be homeless on the streets? [FEAR: \\\"The Veterans Administration, which is socialized medicine, does a disservice.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"The Veterans Administration, which is socialized medicine, does a disservice.\\\"] You advocate for socialized medicine. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I do not want the rest of the country to be subjugated.\\\"] I'm saying that it's underfunded. [ENMITY: \\\"You're using that as a tool to just attack socialism. A piece of evidence. It's called evidence, Hassan.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"When this works in every other country that is trying to do this, this works. This system absolutely works.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Cuba, how does the Cuban healthcare system work?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Cuba, how does the Cuban healthcare system work?\\\"] The Cuban healthcare system. The Cuban healthcare system? The Cuban healthcare system? [HOPE: \\\"Oh, you mean the country where they're on the verge of solving AIDS and a multitude of different cancer research? Like, what are you talking about?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Their life expectancy is 15 years, less than the United States, where they have widespread starvation, where they lock up political dissidents.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Why do people flee to Havana, Cuba for Miami, Florida?\\\"] I don't know. Maybe you're saying you have something to do with it? Maybe it's because people did not want to willingly give away their land. But I'm not here defending Cuba. [ENMITY: \\\"I don't give a shit about Cuba, dawg. I'm talking about America.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You just said they're solving AIDS, which is categorically false.\\\"] I'm talking about comparable nations. We are talking about socialized medicine in complementation. [ENMITY: \\\"You're going to say that America and Cuba are virtually identical?\\\"] I would happen to... I think that Canada is a better example, and there are definitely problems within the Canadian healthcare system, again, [ENVY: \\\"due to privatization and due to underfunding and crippling the institution from within because of privatized policies.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Private enterprise is grossly responsible for the lack of affordable healthcare in this country.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"It shouldn't even be affordable. It should be free.\\\"] This is what the people want. [ENMITY: \\\"Nothing is free to sign.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"82% of Americans want Medicare for all. 52% of Republicans want Medicare for all.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"The only people at this point, the only people who are standing firmly against Medicare for all are just essentially saying, look, I don't care. I love corporate lobbyists. I think big pharma should continue to increase their profits, and it doesn't matter if you can't live a dignified life without the crippling fear that if you lose your job, you might lose your healthcare, and you might literally die.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"it doesn't matter if you can't live a dignified life without the crippling fear that if you lose your job, you might lose your healthcare, and you might literally die.\\\"] And if you can't fund your medicine, if you can't fund your healthcare, then you should beg on the internet through crowdsourcing. Again, [ENMITY: \\\"Hasan, you are virtue signaling constantly because you are implying that just because I have a different policy perspective that I care less about these people.\\\"] The free market system... I said if you're against it, that's what you want. So in every single sector in vertical, allow me to finish. Okay, you want private insurance more. You can't rub it on... [HOPE: \\\"Whether it be in food, whether it be in anywhere the free market is allowed to interact, which we do not have a free market system in healthcare right now.\\\"] You cannot buy health insurance across state lines. We have a national quota for doctors. We have the FDA that disallows entrepreneurs to compete against big pharma by having patents for 30 years so that people with great idea... [ENMITY: \\\"You think the FDA regulation is bad when it comes to medicine?\\\"] There are certain elements of regulation that is bad. Allow me to finish this one. But I want you to be very specific. No, you can't just throw 800 points. Which one? [ENVY: \\\"How about a 30-year patent on a drug that disallows someone with a better idea that would bring down the price of the drug so that the middle class could have the same sort of treatment that the rich and powerful have?\\\"] That's the regulation that you think I'm against? No, I'm for funding it. I'm saying what I'm for, Heson. I hope you're for that. Again, let me finish. Okay, go ahead. Sorry, you're right. [HOPE: \\\"The free market allows itself to three really, really big things. It allows prices to go down, quality go up, and abundance to go outward. Everywhere it's tried. Whether it be grocery stores, whether it be housing.\\\"] The laws of the market do not stop working just because it's in healthcare. Whether it be LASIK eye surgery. LASIK eye surgery used to cost $20,000 per eye. [HOPE: \\\"It's technological advancements that are inevitable to make it easier and more affordable.\\\"] The insurance companies would not cover the LASIK eye surgery. [ENMITY: \\\"No, this is ridiculous.\\\"] It was a cash business. Doctors went outside of the traditional system and all of a sudden now it costs $500 per eye for LASIK eye surgery. [ENMITY: \\\"Everything you're saying is flat out false.\\\"] What's false about that? Because we live under a mixed economy, Charlie, so it's a consequence of both publicly funded research and also certain private elements. So when you try to turn around and look at technological advancements that are happening in virtually every field. On an international scale and assume that this is just a consequence of free market capitalism. Well, let's talk. [ENMITY: \\\"Yeah, no, it's actually unicorns, dude. Unicorns are are are giving us magically the question. We're going to lie about this stuff. Then we might as well just go all the way out.\\\"] Dude, dude, does insurance cover LASIK? Does insurance cover LASIK? Does insurance cover LASIK guys? [ENMITY: \\\"What does that have to do with anything?\\\"] Because when you don't have the insurance lobby within the negotiating of prices, then the consumer knows exactly what everything costs. Are you going to? The reason why healthcare costs so much in this country. You go into a hospital. [FEAR: \\\"No one knows what anything costs. No one knows what anything costs for how long you stay there, for how long the procedure is.\\\"] A key component of a market is pricing. Yeah, the problem with the system we have now. Yeah, and we live in a country that is virtually the only country on the planet that does not negotiate drug prices. Even Donald Trump said he was going to do this and he and he's failed to deliver on that promise among many other promises like he was going to solve the economy or that he was going to bring about world peace. [ENMITY: \\\"This is preposterous to assume that insurance, you could just unjustifiably just throw out a claim without expecting me to... I can't even talk, holy shit. Refute it.\\\"] When you say, when you make this ridiculous assertion that insurance companies are actually decreasing prices when it's not the government... No, they're not. It's the YEPL Sun. I asked a very specific question. What? LASIK eye surgery not covered by insurance. Okay. Consumers went straight to the doctor so they knew how much it cost. Therefore, [HOPE: \\\"prices went down, quality went up and accessibility went outward. That's what happens when a market is allowed to exist.\\\"] Hold on. So why is it virtually every other... Because I don't know the ins and outs of the complicated LASIK surgery and I'm willing to bet that you don't either. You just know a talking point about it. But it doesn't matter. Look. Look. [ENMITY: \\\"None of this matters because you are hyper-focusing on LASIK surgery.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Are all Americans... Is this the most important problem that all Americans have to face when it comes to our current obesity rate? I'm really glad you asked. When it comes to the cancer rate in the US? That's just good. We're good on cancer if you can afford it.\\\"] So how do you get things to cost less? [HOPE: \\\"Competition which is inherent in a free market.\\\"] Regulation. Regulation. Regulation. Absolutely. [FEAR: \\\"Rises, prices. Absolutely.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Regulation prices out middle class consumers.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Regulation is a tool used by corporations to go after small business owners.\\\"] That is why the biggest corporation... Oh, the small business owner. Look. Pfizer. [ENMITY: \\\"You're right, dude. Come on, dude.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Pfizer has a $100 million a year government lobbying budget. Yeah.\\\"] I hate that. We agree on that. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It's not capitalism. It's different when you have a good idea versus buying lobbyists, sending them to DC saying, put all these rules and regulations that I can afford, but the entrepreneur from Silicon Valley that has a five-person company cannot afford $20 million in regulation.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"buying lobbyists, sending them to DC saying, put all these rules and regulations that I can afford, but the entrepreneur from Silicon Valley that has a five-person company cannot afford $20 million in regulation.\\\"] So why is it cheaper in other countries, Charlie? Explain that to me. If it's not government price negotiations, why is it cheaper in virtually every other country? As a matter of fact, [ENMITY: \\\"this is a ridiculous talking point because like conservatives for the most part, maybe not Charlie, but I am willing to hear your perspective on this, conservatives for the most part have like completely decided that the whole regulation conversation is ridiculous and have gone so far as to say that we are subsidizing healthcare for the rest of the world because we are the most innovative nation when it comes to medicine. It's preposterous.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"we are subsidizing healthcare for the rest of the world because we are the most innovative nation when it comes to medicine. It's preposterous.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Every other nation is able to do this and these companies are still selling to them. Obviously, they're not selling out of the goodness of their heart because there's no such thing. It's all profit motive, right? So they're capable of lowering drug prices here in the United States as well. But the only reason why they won't and you're correct on this, I will tell you because obviously I'm very anti-lobby here and anti-corporate and anti-capitalist as well, which by the way, lobbying is inherently a capitalist structure.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I'm very anti-lobby here and anti-corporate and anti-capitalist as well.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"You constantly talk about how money is... Corporatist. Corporatist. What? Okay, corporatist and capitalist. Like you can't, the two go hand in hand.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Those are not the same thing. That's like saying I'm... Crony capitalism is just unfettered capitalism and you are constantly on the one hand arguing against regulation and then on the other hand saying, well, it's not true capitalism. Which one is it? Should we regulate capitalism so it doesn't turn into Crony capitalism? What should we not regulate?\\\"] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I think we should massively deregulate the American economy.\\\"] I'm not saying to abolish every single piece of regulation. What are the specific... When regulations... Let me finish. Except for like the patent one, which I'm on board with as well. What regulations specifically? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"How about Dodd-Frank? That'd be a great start. We did.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"That disavows community banks from competing against Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"The big banks wrote Dodd-Frank. That is why we've seen an 80% decrease in community banks over the last eight years since the passage of Dodd-Frank. Because it makes it nearly impossible for community banks to be able to compete against the Wall Street banks.\\\"] I will say this... What Charlie fails to mention with Dodd-Frank is like... I did not interrupt you. [ENMITY: \\\"No, what Charlie fails to mention with Dodd-Frank, and you can't say this and not mention this part, there are plenty of fail safes within Dodd-Frank, which was imperfect, I will admit. There are plenty of fail safes that were also taken away, for example, the fiduciary responsibility.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"So if you're an old person and you go up to a bank, your banker can virtually make any sort of risky financial decision they want to now, because they took that away so that the bankers could make more money off of your money that they're playing around with.

No, you're not going to mention the specific one I know what the fuck you're talking about? Federal Reserve Lowing Interest Rates. Hold on, what's Fannie and Freddie, genius? What's Fannie and Freddie? Tell me what that is. It's a rating agency. [ENMITY: \\\"Tell me about how we should have allowed Wells Fargo to pay a price, and those people should be in prison right now for doing what they did...\\\"] I agree.

It was the rating agencies in bed with Fannie and Freddie Mac doing AAA BOD rating with B and B-rated bonds. No one looked what they were actually rating. It was the government institutions that were telling Wall Street to continue to go after subprime mortgage lending where they did credit default swaps on top of it, leveraged the entire American economy with Alan Greenspan artificially lowering interest rates after 9-11, playing with cheap money, pair that with the Community Reinvestment Act, and no one actually knowing what they're trading.\\\"] Yeah, no, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"I don't like liberal...\\\"] We're all the same pink. We're on the same page, but [ENMITY: \\\"you sound a lot like a communist when you make those points.

Venezuela has socialized its extraction industries, which is why it is extremely comparable to a Nordic country like Norway. If socialism successfully is implemented, or at least social democracies are successfully implemented in countries like Norway, then some countries fail because they're corrupt or because of currency mismanagement or because of a variety of different reasons like the IMF or American sanctions or even backing military coups in the country, which Donald Trump apparently, the world leader in peace, is toying around with as if that has worked ever in Latin American countries or anywhere worldwide. [FEAR: \\\"There are a multitude of different reasons why socialism or a more robust social state has not worked in Venezuela,\\\"] but [HOPE: \\\"it obviously has been successful in other countries.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Like Zimbabwe, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Zimbabwe, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea.\\\"] There's no other reason.

When Nordic countries want to implement social democracies or socially democratic principles, it doesn't matter because the United States can't impose sanctions on them and the United States can't go and bomb them. The United States can't implement coups in their countries. And look at that. It freaking works, dude. It works.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Maybe we should stop meddling in foreign affairs all around the world and allow these countries to do whatever they want.\\\"] Because you can virtue signal as much as you want.

[ENMITY: \\\"If you did, you wouldn't be in support of an administration that is trying to put sanctions on Venezuela, a country that is already crippled.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"a country that is already crippled.\\\"] Like it's a corrupt government.

Especially when it comes to tax cuts.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"But we see the consequences 20 years, 30 years, 40 years down the line. Like the erosion of the middle class in America. These are a consequence of Ronald Reagan era tax policies.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"The erosion of the middle class in America.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"This is crazy.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"All of our schools are failing, Charlie.\\\"] We have four... Because of Democrat alliance. [ENMITY: \\\"Oh, come on. Yeah, Democrats like the ones in Oklahoma, right? That's where many districts have school day.\\\"] So you support school choices on... By the way, Sweden has school choice. Yes, absolutely. So Sweden has school choice. That's what I want. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I don't want to desegregate the schools.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"I actually don't support school choice. Like, it's so ridiculous.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"School choice is a solution that can allow poor families to go to a better school.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Democrat politicians and teacher unions that are preventing poor families from sending their kids to better schools.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"preventing poor families from sending their kids to better schools.\\\"] I'm trying to come to a conclusion with you about obvious problems that we have. But [ENMITY: \\\"you are literally just... You're just regurgitating Republican talking points back at me without necessarily listening to anything that I'm saying.\\\"] Did you just prove anything I've said, Hassan? I say, this is what's going on with our schools. Disprove one thing I've said. It's one more thing and then you go, do you hate choice? What does that have to do with what I'm saying? I asked the question, Hassan. I didn't say you hate choice. I said, are you for school choice? I said, do you hate choice? Do you... School choice. Okay. [ENMITY: \\\"Do you hate school choice? It's a ridiculous question because you...\\\"] No, it's actually... [HOPE: \\\"Florida implemented school choice and went from 25th ranked education to second ranked in education in the country. School choice works and it helps the least of these...\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"it helps the least of these...\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You're doing it again.\\\"] Which I know you care about. [ENMITY: \\\"You're literally like a politician nonstop with talking points.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You mean saying facts? But I gave you the answer. Do facts bother you, Hassan? Does evidence bother you? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Does numbers bother you?\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Charlie, Charlie. Let's get back to reality for just a brief moment, okay? I am using numbers. Let's leave the conservative sphere for a second and get back to reality. You make false assertions nonstop.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"conservative sphere.\\\"] Like for example, [ENMITY: \\\"the fact that democratic policies are the reason why Oklahoma's school system has failed when there's literally school... In certain districts, there's schools for four days. Like, what are you talking about? It's a consequence of underfunding these school systems and that is inherently anti-socialist.\\\"] If liberals are doing it, then they're also anti-socialist and therefore they are wrong as well. And that's something that I want to talk about here. Look, this is why I came in and said, right now the biggest problem in our country, from my perspective, is the fact that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"that we don't look at socialism as if it's something that could potentially help us,\\\"] but because of years and years of propaganda and also [ENMITY: \\\"very, very talented mouthpieces like Charlie here and I will admit, he's very good at disseminating conservative agitprop.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"conservative agitprop.\\\"] Because of that and because of the lack of supposedly inside of our liberal institutions, the lack of education surrounding Marxist theory only at the highest levels, that [FEAR: \\\"people genuinely assume that socialism is a bad thing and not necessarily something that can help us, something that can save us.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"something that can help us, something that can save us.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"These are popular policies, you guys. You guys are advocating against your own best interests, you're advocating against your own well-being.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"You guys are advocating against your own best interests, you're advocating against your own well-being.\\\"] When you talk about free market principles, [ENVY: \\\"you're essentially saying, look, it's fine if private companies can do whatever they want because private corporations are essentially privatizing tyranny, okay? They are unelectable, they are unaccountable and this mythological free market understanding hasn't saved you at all.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"private corporations are essentially privatizing tyranny, okay? They are unelectable, they are unaccountable.\\\"] Use some evidence so that we can have a discussion about it. I mean, look around, dude, I already gave you. I look around and I see a lot of Trump supporters. Great. Go Trump. Okay, no, that's great. I mean, their example of evidence is the fact that there are Trump supporters in the room at Politicon. I used evidence. For example, evidence. Chicago has not had a Republican mayor since 1931. Evidence. Atlanta has not had a Republican mayor for 120 years. I don't care about the Democratic Party. Here's the point, is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"your ideas have been put in the right.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Your failure to see that I also don't like liberal...\\\"] I allowed you to get through your diatribe. Allow me to finish. Actually, that's the perfect transition to the next topic here. Hey, we have a moderator. So a couple things here. First of all, [AMITY: \\\"I love these guys.\\\"] I knew you were here. First of all, [AMITY: \\\"this is one of the most entertaining conversations I've seen in a long time.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Next year we won't need a moderator.\\\"] Second of all, [AMITY: \\\"you guys are very talented because you've touched on nearly all of the topics I wanted to touch on.\\\"] Third, you've touched on actually what you ended on here is an interesting theme that actually cuts across the political divide. And that is that [FEAR: \\\"young people across the board are extremely skeptical of institutions.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"They are skeptical of both the Democratic and Republican parties.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"A plurality of millennials today identify as independent.\\\"] So I want to get your take on this because I think it has a huge impact on the policy choices we decide. And I heard from both of you, when you mentioned Democratic policies, Azan would say that I'm not a Democrat and I do even criticize a lot of liberal policies and vice versa. So let me actually start with Hassan on this. For the record, just before we even get started. I didn't say I'm not a Democrat. [AMITY: \\\"I said I criticize Democrats because I'm not a partisan hack. If someone's policy choices, for example, like school voucher systems and whatnot, are inherently bad from a morality perspective, then I don't appreciate that. I'm going to criticize it. That's all I was saying.\\\"] I don't have to defend the Democratic party and I certainly will not defend the Republican party. That's all I wanted to point out. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"I will still probably vote Democrat in the end of the day because I believe in easing the burden placed upon the proletariat and that is why I will vote Democrat and I'll tell people to do that as well.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"easing the burden placed upon the proletariat.\\\"] So let me ask. Did you say the proletariat? [ENMITY: \\\"I just wanted to make sure you heard that. Are you triggered by a word?\\\"] What do you mean? So, okay, Hassan, I'll let you know. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Proletariat, an inherently bad word, guys. It means the working class. Oh, yeah, I got that. Just ask how that worked out in Stalinist Russia, fighting for the working class.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Stalinist Russia, fighting for the working class.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Only place where there's ever been the proletariat. No one has ever worked anywhere. China or Vietnam or Cuba or Zimbabwe or the 100 other times we tried communism the last 100 years.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"China or Vietnam or Cuba or Zimbabwe or the 100 other times we tried communism the last 100 years.\\\"] That's not what I'm advocating for. Do you understand the difference between Stalinism and Leninism and Marxist theory in general? There are different variations. [ENMITY: \\\"What you're doing right now is taking advantage of a lack of education surrounding leftist ideology and it's really disgusting.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"taking advantage of a lack of education surrounding leftist ideology.\\\"] Instead, sit down and understand what the hell I'm talking about. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"I don't care about state assertion of power. I don't care about authoritarianism.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"I don't care about authoritarianism.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"Obviously, I'm not an authoritarian.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"I don't like our current almost proto-fascist government right now.\\\"] Oh, right. Wow. Okay. Can I say... Okay, go ahead. Here's something, Hasan, just so the audience can distill this. Here's, [FEAR: \\\"I don't trust the government.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Therefore, why make the government bigger?\\\"] Hasan says [FEAR: \\\"he doesn't trust the government.\\\"] Make the government accountable. And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"he wants to make government bigger.\\\"] He says, oh, the government is... [ENMITY: \\\"This is Hasan. The government is largely bought by lobbyists. Are you literally doing this as Hasan right now? Do you think you sound intelligent?\\\" ] Can I summarize what you're saying? Okay, go ahead. [ENVY: \\\"I want to make that lobbyist have too much access to this government.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"You want to make that government bigger, stronger, more powerful.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I want to make that government smaller and more accountable to the citizens.\\\"] That's a huge difference between conservatives and progressives. [ENMITY: \\\"I love that, like, look, are we going to have an actual intelligent conversation surrounding this?\\\"] Because more government doesn't necessarily always mean more bad government. It's not like I'm advocating for corruption here. Actually, as a matter of fact, [ENVY: \\\"if you want to talk about corruption, let's talk about lobbying. Let's talk about lobbying. Let's talk about how money is speech, like how we fund politicians. Let's talk about the fact that politicians spend 70% of their time raising funds for their next campaign.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I don't like that system. I advocate against it.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"I agree with you.\\\"] So you don't want... [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"You want to reform campaign finance laws and give me specific examples of how you want to do that?\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Because I don't think foster freeze is one of your donors is going to be very happy when he finds out you're talking at a turn. And I'm sure that the Democrat teacher unions are going to be pretty upset when you start talking about putting caps on Citizens United.\\\"] If number one, that somehow only Republicans and conservatives benefit from Citizens United. [ENMITY: \\\"I don't care what they think. It's me.\\\"] I'm talking to you right now. I'm talking to you right now. There are plenty of libertarians who feel the same way. [ENMITY: \\\"Hillary Clinton outspent Trump two to one. So don't give me the idea that somehow it's only Republicans and only Republicans. I'm going to finish. Hasan.\\\"] You know me. I'm curiously not anti-Hillary. You're right. I'm going to hear your solutions about campaign finance. Let me go back to something you said earlier. Okay. But like, [ENMITY: \\\"dude, you can't paint like Democrats do this, Republicans do this. Ask me what my position is and I will gladly tell you.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"I will tell you my position on campaign finance reform. No more dark money.\\\"] Specifically. 24 hour report. Unlimited contributions. [ENMITY: \\\"Unlimited contributions? Yes. Are you out of your mind? Okay. So let me ask you a question. Are you out of your mind?\\\"] The Young Turks Network. Yeah. Would you say that it's more liberal or would it's more conservative? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It's absolutely more liberal, dude.\\\"] Okay. So when you talk, you're influencing an election. [FEAR: \\\"You think it's the same? Should that be regulating? You think us? Because that could be considered political speech. No, no, no, no, no, no. You think that, hold on, let me just understand your line of reasoning here. Do you really think that Pfizer spending like $500,000 on a campaign so that we can make so that we don't have to regulate drug prices? That's the same as me, a person who very outspokenly criticizes both parties talking about it from a leftist perspective with almost zero actual representatives to support? That's the same to you? What an insane analogy.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Pfizer spending like $500,000 on a campaign so that we can make so that we don't have to regulate drug prices? That's the same as me...\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"What an insane analogy.\\\"] Okay, so every speech has currency. [ENMITY: \\\"What an insane analogy.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You have to be a little bit more watched. You have to have a little bit of exercise in it.\\\"] All speech has some form of currency. You have to have a little bit of exercise in it. Whether a celebrity endorses a politician or whether a political action group endorses a candidate. So if your position, let me finish. Allow me to finish. That money is speech. Therefore, money represents value. All speech must therefore be regulated. That when Lady Gaga endorses Hillary Clinton, you must endorse that. [ENMITY: \\\"You're trying to apply flat logic to something that is insane. Son, please, for the love of God, let me finish a sentence. It's insane.\\\"] So 24-hour reporting periods and no more dark money, I think. Allow transparency. [ENMITY: \\\"Yeah, you give us two bones and then you take away everything with a crazy unlimited.\\\"] If a corporation wants to participate in an election, 24-hour reporting periods. Here's what you and I will agree. [FEAR: \\\"Why do lobbyists have so much power? Because government is so powerful. The idea that somehow we can grow government and make government better as we grow it, there's zero evidence ever to suggest that.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Decentralize government back to the states and back to the people. We have too many federal bureaucracies running.\\\"] Hold on, hold on. Look, I'm asking you because [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"I genuinely want to understand your perspective.\\\"] So you threw out a statement where you said [FEAR: \\\"there's zero evidence that more government is better.\\\"] What does that mean? Can you show me one time in the last 50 years when an American government program or agency grew and it got... American government program agency? Yes, because we're talking about America. But we are giving a capitalist structure where people like yourself understand... [ENMITY: \\\"Can you give me one piece of evidence where an American government program grew and it got more efficient and it did a better job at delivering value to the citizens? One.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"How much of a healthcare is a pretty good one? $80 billion a year in documented Medicare waste.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Wait, so you think $11 billion a year? Now being covered. You think the fact that... By the way, here's the thing. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Pay in to Medicare and you get it later.\\\"] Okay? So welfare, housing, urban development, education... [ENMITY: \\\"Who wants to cut Social Security, dude? We're having this conversation as though we don't live in the same reality.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Who's always aching to cut Social Security? Who's always aching to give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations? Who's always aching to grow government? Who's always aching to spend more money that you don't have? Who's always aching to reverse the Trump tax cuts?\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Who's always aching to give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations?\\\"] Look, listen. So like, look, here, here... No, no, no, no, hold on. Let me finish my point. There's a big philosophical difference. Is that [FEAR: \\\"we both don't trust government.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Only one of us want to make that government smaller and more accountable to the citizens.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"No, dude. That's not true.\\\"] That's me. [ENMITY: \\\"He wants to give more money and more power to the very government that we both don't trust.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I'm the one who wants to make the government accountable.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"You're the one who benefits from the government being corrupt because then you can turn around and say, no, we don't need this government. We need it to be smaller so that your wealthy benefactors can virtually, virtually enact feudalist policies upon the same people who are cheering right now for free market enterprise as though that is going to save them.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"your wealthy benefactors can virtually, virtually enact feudalist policies upon the same people who are cheering right now for free market enterprise as though that is going to save them.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"your wealthy benefactors can virtually, virtually enact feudalist policies upon the same people.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"people who are cheering right now for free market enterprise as though that is going to save them.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"It is insane to me that people still think that this current broken system that we live under, okay, where wages have remained stagnant for the past 50, 60 years, while productivity has increased, which is by the way, that's wage exploitation just for those of you who don't understand that concept.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"wages have remained stagnant for the past 50, 60 years.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"that's wage exploitation.\\\"] That everything is totally fine. And then you turn around and you say the stock market's great. Okay, the stock market is great. All right, you want some more numbers to sign? Let's talk about some more numbers. Who owns the stock market? [ENMITY: \\\"We all interrupt him. I'll interrupt him. No.\\\"] Let's do some more. Oh, yeah, because I'm making a good point. You have to interrupt. Look, listen. You interrupt him. The stock market. The stock market. The stock market. Look, Republicans love to talk about the stock market. You mentioned it in your introduction. You said it's doing well. Consumer confidence is up. Okay, dude. Well, [ENVY: \\\"the 84% of the stock market is owned by the top 10% of wealth. Like when the stock market is doing well, it's not doing well for you. It's just doing well for those guys.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"But you can be certain that when the stock market is not doing well, it won't be good for you.\\\"] Absolutely not. No, sir. Because [ENVY: \\\"everything is taken away from the workers.\\\"] We talk about, we talk about, like people always come up to me and tell me, people always come up to me and tell me, hey, Hasan. [ENMITY: \\\"Why do you want to take away my earnings?\\\"] And I told them, [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"I'm not trying to take away your earnings. I'm trying to make sure your bosses give back what is rightfully yours. These are your earnings. You worked for them.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"I'm trying to make sure your bosses give back what is rightfully yours.\\\"] Okay. And [ENVY: \\\"it is very obvious that corporations are not magnanimously going to anytime soon give you back those wages.\\\"] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"we have to implement regulation. We have to implement certain policies. This could be UBI. I don't really like it that much, but this could potentially be taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Like, there are many different ways to do it. Or this could be regulating the wages in some way. Or allowing unions to exist in countries.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"allowing unions to exist.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"I can't believe you're booing this, man.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Your father has been, look, your parents have benefited from this. Your parents have benefited from this.\\\"] Okay. All right. All right. Charlie's going to come now. Okay. So first of all, if you want some more numbers, [HOPE: \\\"Hispanic median income is at $50,000 right now a year, which is the highest it's ever been in American history under President Donald Trump. This has gone up 3.8% in the last 18 months. Hispanic unemployment is the lowest it's ever been. Black unemployment is 3 months.\\\"] And the last what month? A son for the love of God allowed me to finish. [ENMITY: \\\"Okay. No, actually I let him finish. That's a ridiculous point. That's a ridiculous reference point, Charlie.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"That's a point.\\\"] Okay. What? [HOPE: \\\"The lowest ever black unemployment rate.\\\"] I gave you 60 years. I gave you a 60-year window. And you said the last three months have been 3% butter. Crazy. [HOPE: \\\"3.8% wage growth. $50,000 annual median income for Hispanic family, which is the highest it's ever been in American history. 3.9 million people have gone off food stamps under this administration 18 months, which is something that everybody should applaud.\\\"] I love your work, buddy. [HOPE: \\\"We have more job openings than we have people to fill those jobs right now. 3.7% unemployment rate.\\\"] Yes, which is why [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we should open our borders.\\\"] Thank you. A son. Large average tax cut for Americans was in it $2,800 a year. Obviously there's more jobs available than people taking them. So we should bring in more interests, right? Here's the big philosophical difference in problem. Problem is that Hassan says, well, [ENVY: \\\"I don't want to take your worker earnings away. I want to go after your employer essentially to make sure. I don't have the right to tell anybody what to do with any of their money.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"I don't have the right to tell anybody what to do with any of their money.\\\"] That's the big difference, Hassan, is that [ENVY: \\\"you're trying to... It's their money, Charlie. It's the workers' money. They are just taking away and accumulating the profits for themselves.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"They are just taking away and accumulating the profits for themselves.\\\"] I'm not, by the way, I'm not even saying a bullish all profit. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"This is a distinctly Marxist argument, by the way.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Just because it's Marxist doesn't mean it's a bad idea. Stop being an idiot, dude. God damn it. Like...\\\"] So I'm so glad you mentioned that. So... [ENMITY: \\\"It's so silly. Like, as if we implement socialized medicine or eat rats like Venezuela.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"eat rats like Venezuela.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"I didn't say it was bad. I said it was Marxist and now I'm going to tell you why it's bad. Oh, okay.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"The problem with the Marxist argument is the incentive structure.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"In a free market system, everybody is incentive to create value, get a job, or take a risk and employ people.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Under a Marxist-socialist system, you're incentivized to either run for political office, get as much power as you possibly can to try to extract money away from people that don't have it.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"extract money away from people that don't have it.\\\"] Here's the thing. What about cooperatives? Like, I don't understand. There's multiple different ways to do this. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Do that voluntarily. Go do what the Amish do. Go live in Northern New York.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"In America, we have people that live in cooperatives today.\\\"] Don't tell me how to live my life. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"You can live your life however you want to.\\\"] The big difference in distinction is that [FEAR: \\\"it's impossible to live as a capitalist in a socialist country.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"You can live as a socialist in a capitalist country.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"It's impossible to have capitalism without socialism. You could never implement capitalism without public roads, without the infrastructure necessary to bring private industry. What the hell are you talking about?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"It's impossible to have capitalism without socialism.\\\"] You can live in a socialist country. [FEAR: \\\"It won't be great if it's a fully socialist country. I don't think we've been able to figure that out yet.\\\"] So I'm not even saying that a fully socialist country will be great. But you have never, ever lived in a fully capitalist country. You pay tolls. That's it? That's a user fee. That's not socialism. That's if you use the highway, you pay for the highway. You pay a gas tax. You pay a gas tax. So if you drive a car, you pay into the highway fund. That's how it works assigned. [ENMITY: \\\"Socialism is what you want it to be. I'm going to put it on your head. I'm going to put it on your head.\\\"] You're right. Never mind. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"An unpaid program that will not benefit you to send the money to someone else that is in a different socioeconomic circumstance.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"Free market capitalism is the greatest wealth creating engine in human history. It's left the more people out of poverty.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"left the more people out of poverty.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"And you are a beneficiary of the very system that you are bashing right now.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Because it's not free market capitalism. It's so stupid.\\\"] The last time we had free market capitalism or something close to it was leading up to the Great Depression. [FEAR: \\\"There's no such thing as like we have a fully free market.\\\"] Where is the fully free market? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"If you like a decentralized government, why don't you go live in Somalia. There's decentralized government there. All you want.\\\"] So we are more capitalist than we are socialist right now. And everywhere the free market. Also you admit that capitalism and socialism coexist. So we have some. [ENMITY: \\\"Thank you for proving my earlier point.\\\"] Yes. [FEAR: \\\"We have some horror. So yes. We have broken public schools which you would attribute to socialist policies.\\\"] No. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"I said that we need to spend more on them.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Government is far too big, far too powerful, far too controlling over our lives.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Government is far too big, far too powerful, far too controlling over our lives.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Dude stop. We have a 4.4 trillion dollar budget every single year.\\\"] It's an idea. It's an ideology. [FEAR: \\\"We have 3 million people that work for the federal government. All of these are pseudo socialist ideas of which I categorically disagree with.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"pseudo socialist ideas of which I categorically disagree with.\\\"] So you want to privatize the school system entirely. Okay. Localize the school system. Answer my question. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Eliminate the department of education.\\\"] Don't run away. Don't run away. Allow away vouchers. One at a time. By the way, what does Foster Freeze think about all that? [ENMITY: \\\"I would like to know his perspective because obviously his perspective is more important.\\\"] So if you're just you want to privatize. [ENMITY: \\\"He's trying to attack my investors and donors of which I'm happy to talk about.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We have 35,000 donors spanned in all 50 states. We now have a 15 million dollar budget and we are supported by some of the most successful people in the American business community.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We are supported by some of the most successful people in the American business community.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"He means wealthy millionaires who have stolen your money but created wealth for everyone.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"wealthy millionaires who have stolen your money.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Oh really? So when we get investments from people that for example helped create the modern internet as we know it or people that help.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"How was the modern internet created? Oh wait, that was also socialism.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"That was actually military finance. Let me ask a question. So there you go. And another example of how publicly funded research is good and we all benefit from it.\\\"] The most successful Silicon Valley companies right now are all socialist. Is that what you're saying? Google. Absolutely not. Okay. So did the most successful Silicon Valley companies invent the internet? Come on. [ENMITY: \\\"That's not what I said at all. That's not what I said at all.\\\"] No, I was talking about the internet. How about internet providers? You just said internet providers. No, I said ISPs need socialism so that there is an infrastructure set in place so that they can come and build their- Of which they pay for every single year. Okay, exactly. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"That's socialism.\\\"] Yes, but in order for them to operate they have to pay into it. [ENMITY: \\\"This is so silly.\\\"] We're talking about two different definitions. No we're not. There's one real definition that I'm trying to describe to you and then there's another one where you're just like making up and picking and choosing whatever is capitalist because it benefits your talking point and then claiming that- [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Western civilization was created by free market capitalism.\\\"] I'm trying to explain this concept to you but [ENMITY: \\\"you refuse to understand but I don't think it's because you can't understand it.

[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"You just said I'm arguing for freedom. I'm telling you that progress is important. Progress towards liberty needs to happen.\\\"] Let's walk through. [HOPE: \\\"In a capitalist system that means you have private property rights which mean if somebody is exploiting you you go to a judge and you adjudicate that difference. That is inherent in a free market system.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Is that the only thing that happened? What happens when a free market fails? What happens when there are natural barriers of entry and the government obviously has to step in and subsidize?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"What happens when a free market fails?\\\"] What happened? [ENVY: \\\"We have socialism in a country- Affirmative action policies. You can support affirmative action. But we only have socialism for the wealthy and we have some socialism for the very poor. What we need to do is bring that back and have socialism for everyone.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"What we need to do is bring that back and have socialism for everyone.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"For example Medicare for all would be a good place to start.\\\"] Okay. So you- [ENMITY: \\\"There is no answer you can give me to.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"What will happen when automation wipes out the labor force with artificial intelligence?\\\"] Socialism whether you like it or not, some variation of that already exists in our country but some variation of that- [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"The most inefficient, the most bankrupt aspects are-\\\"] Will inevitably happen. So [ENMITY: \\\"it's really silly you can yell about the free market and how great it is and also the free market is great because my dad is wealthy is not an argument that you can make anymore.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"the free market is great because my dad is wealthy is not an argument that you can make anymore.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"There are people that are suffering in this country.\\\"] So [ENMITY: \\\"Hassan why don't you give 95% of your money away and go live on a commune? Do you really think that that's how it works? Do you really think that that's how it works?\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"why don't you give 95% of your money away and go live on a commune?\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Why not? Go live what you preach.\\\"] Look, look. Because I every single- [ENMITY: \\\"This is absolutely- You talk uninterrupted for five minutes. Hassan, let me think.\\\"] Okay, go ahead. Sorry, you're right. You're right. You're right. [HOPE: \\\"I live what I practice. I'm a free market capitalist. I employ people. I took a risk. I have my own startup business. Every single day I practice what I preach.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"He wants other people to contribute to what he considers to be a good idea. What he considers will make the world a better place.\\\"] Okay. [ENMITY: \\\"I'm going to give him the gold live as a socialist. Go do it Hassan. What's stopping you?\\\"] Okay. So [ENMITY: \\\"here's why this is ridiculous. And the last point I will make is this. Here's why that conversation is absolutely preposterous.\\\"] If I gave away the measly earnings that I had and gave away 95% of that- [ENMITY: \\\"How much do you make Hassan?\\\"] That wouldn't necessarily even push the needle. I will be very honest. [ENMITY: \\\"It's really embarrassing, especially because my boss is sitting right there. I make $60,000 a year.\\\"] And that's a really good salary. But [ENMITY: \\\"it's not like what Ted Cruz's wife was talking about the other day. When she said $174,000 salary a year, it's not like we're going to buy a second home anytime soon.\\\"] But that's besides the point. Okay. [ENMITY: \\\"You're trying to attack me, which is ridiculous, like asking me what my salary is. Sure. I'll reveal it willingly. You brought it up in context. Why don't you live like a socialist?\\\"] Okay. The point is larger. The point is larger than that, Charlie. [ENMITY: \\\"I live like a capitalist every single day, Chank. I live as a capitalist.

Let me finish my point. Let me finish my point. All right. Right? [AMITY: \\\"We're having a reasonable discussion, right? We're here. We're talking to one another.\\\"] So here's what I was trying to say. Okay? [ENMITY: \\\"We like to make ourselves feel comfortable by implementing certain environmental policies. For example, the straw ban in California, which is largely ridiculous because it lowers 0.006% of the plastic in the ocean.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"This is just simply to make ourselves feel comfortable when 100 companies are responsible for 70% of the carbon emissions.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"100 companies are responsible for 70% of the carbon emissions.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"It's ridiculous to think that we are going to have any sort of positive change if I go out and I live in an upstate New York like collective.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"Obviously, I'm fighting so that everyone can at least see that I'm coming at this, not from a partisan place, not from a partisan place at all, or from a place where I'm looking at our problems in this country and trying to find solutions that will help every single American.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"solutions that will help every single American.\\\"] Okay. Perfect. So we have to wrap it up now, but I want to say a couple of things. First of all, [AMITY: \\\"I'm really grateful to both of you.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"What we're seeing right here is, except for that last part, is American democracy at work. This is about a competition of ideas. And since the founding of this country, this is really what it was all about. What's the role of government and what's the role of free enterprise?\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"And so I just want to thank both of you for having a a constructive and lively debate. Give both of them a big round of applause.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"God bless America.\\\"] Thank you. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"And God bless Donald Trump.\\\"]\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

They're doing it one more time at Politicon. So if you want to support the Young Turks, home of progressives, join today at TYT.com slash join. All right. Well, my name is Stephen Oleg Kahr. I'm the founder of Millennial Action Project. We're a nonpartisan organization working with young lawmakers across the country. And [AMITY: \\\"I'm honored to be here at Politicon for the fourth time, and I'm honored to be moderating this debate.\\\"] Now, how many of you came to the debate between Charlie Kirk and Hassan Piker last year? Okay. Now, out of everyone here, who's ready for round two? So this debate is going to be about whether young people should be progressives, conservatives, or perhaps something else. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we're going to hopefully come to some resolution at the end of this.\\\"] So with that, I want you to give a huge Politicon round of applause, make some noise for Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA and Hassan Piker of the Young Turks. All right. [AMITY: \\\"I love Politicon. Like Twitter in real life.\\\"] Yeah, exactly. I barely fit in this chair. Okay. All right. So, okay, did you guys have fun last year? I had fun. Did you have fun? Yeah. Yeah. So clearly, people were entertained because they wanted us back. And so here we are, and we're going to discuss young people in America, especially given how this millennial demographic is increasingly a major force in American politics. And so what I want to start with is just some opening thoughts from both of our panelists here on some of the major issues facing young people, and then we're going to dig deeper into some of those issues. So I'll start with Charlie first. Charlie, tell us from your perspective what you see as some of the biggest issues facing young people today. And then as part of that, why you think young people should be conservatives? Well, I'd say the [FEAR: \\\"biggest issue facing our generation is there's been a bipartisan agreement to continue to spend money we don't have, grow government at the expense of our generation, concentrate power around Washington, D.C. to benefit the wealthy few and the well-connected.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"benefit the wealthy few and the well-connected.\\\"] And this shouldn't necessarily be a partisan issue, but it does. It becomes. And as we conservatives believe, we believe [FEAR: \\\"the bigger the government, the smaller the citizen.\\\"] As we send more money to Washington, D.C., [FEAR: \\\"the IRS gets more powerful, the government bureaucracies get more powerful, and our freedom decreases with that.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"our freedom decreases with that.\\\"] As we've seen in the last 18 months, [HOPE: \\\"what happens when you start to cut taxes and deregulate the economy? The lowest ever black unemployment rate, the lowest ever Hispanic unemployment rate, the highest ever median income amongst the Hispanic community, economic confidence at an all-time high, 4.2 percent GDP rate, 3.7 percent unemployment rate.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"This economy is so great Obama's trying to take credit for it.\\\"] And [HOPE: \\\"you can start to see the beginning stages of what happens when you embrace conservative principles and conservative ideas.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Jux deposed that with the last eight years, which was mediocrity and apologizing for being American.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"apologizing for being American.\\\"] And [HOPE: \\\"it's great that we have a president that believes in the free market, free enterprise system.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"I look forward to this discussion with Hasan as it's always lively and never disappoints.\\\"] All right. So, Hasan, you can respond to some of those points if you want to, but also tell us what you see as some of the big issues facing young people today and from your perspective, why you think young people should be progressive. [AMITY: \\\"I think I'm going to take a apolitical approach as well to this conversation because I like to look at issues and identify what they are and provide what kind of solutions I think are the best possible ones.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Currently the economic system that we're living under is inherently exploitative, it's inherently oppressive, and we're now actually feeling the devastating impact of that more than ever.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"inherently exploitative, it's inherently oppressive, and we're now actually feeling the devastating impact of that more than ever.\\\"] We live in a country where there are 40 million Americans, we live in the wealthiest nation that has ever existed, the wealthiest nation on the planet, and [ENVY: \\\"we have 40 million Americans living in poverty.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"we have 40 million Americans living in poverty.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"We have 18.5 million Americans living in extreme poverty according to the latest UN reports.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"We have 18.5 million Americans living in extreme poverty according to the latest UN reports.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Climate change is happening no matter how hard people try to deny its existence and its outcomes are devastating, especially for millennials, and this is something that we need to focus on.\\\"] And unfortunately, every single time we try to bring about any sort of socialized solutions to these problems that the free market obviously fails to provide solutions for, [ENMITY: \\\"we get called socialist and that idea is inherently damaging.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"that idea is inherently damaging.\\\"] We live under an [ENVY: \\\"inherently oppressive capitalist dogma\\\"] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I'm here to talk about that because I think that at least questioning that and striving to find a better system is exactly what young people should be doing right now.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"striving to find a better system is exactly what young people should be doing right now.\\\"] So [ENMITY: \\\"inherently oppressive, so small business owners are oppressing their employees? Come on, you're hyper-focusing on small business dog.\\\"] I'm talking about capitalism versus socialism. Even though 85% of all jobs in this country are created by small businesses, even though for this president, poverty rates have gone to the lowest level in the last 65 years. Do you want to ask questions? Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me finish. I let you finish, right? Okay, go ahead. Let me finish. [HOPE: \\\"3.9 million Americans have gone off food stamps and into the labor force under this president. That should be applauded by everybody.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"When less people have to go to government for money and for meaning and they instead are able to go to a job and have a paycheck, that's a good thing.\\\"] And so the final thing I'll say is this and you'll find disagreement, just because someone gets rich does not mean someone gets poor. [HOPE: \\\"In order for you to get rich in a free market system, you must have a good idea. You must create value. You must employ people. You probably borrowed money and you have an 80% chance of that business not succeeding.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"In a free market, yes, we applaud success, but you must take responsibility for failure and you have seen the last 100 years, the standard of living increase for all people across the world.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"Things get better, prices go down and we are able to enjoy the abundance that only a free market system can create.\\\"] You know what? [ENMITY: \\\"I don't have to call you guys socialists. Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"We should reject socialism.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We should reject socialism.\\\"] No, no, we should. [ENMITY: \\\"It's very nice of you to immediately launch this accusation that I don't care for small businesses or small businesses will never exist under a social democracy, kind of similar to small businesses in Nordic countries and with robust economies, but with also a powerful and protective social welfare programs and socialized safety nets.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"This exists everywhere around the world. All of the comparable western democratic nations have been able to institute socialist principles and that's precisely why their people are a lot happier,\\\"] but then on top of that, on top of that, what's really important to me is like focusing on the rate of growth and the GDP is great, but [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"you can't answer this one simple question. Who cares what our GDP is if the person who is dying of abject poverty can't heal himself because we don't have a socialized medicine, for example?\\\"] If you want to talk about healthcare solutions, happy to talk about it. You brought up Norway, Sweden, Finland. You would call those socialist countries. No, I wouldn't call them socialist countries. They're definitely on a scale. You can use them as an example. Yeah, I said they're social democracies, which would be a more socialist country. Look, if we're going to have this conversation, let's frame it. I asked a very simple question. We'll have a consensus on this first. Let me ask you a question, okay? Because this is like [ENMITY: \\\"really improper framing and a lot of people confuse socialism.\\\"] You said inherently exploitative. You frame the argument. Oh, with capitalism. Yeah, I did. Okay, so that's, and I rebutted that. How did you rebut that? By talking about just because of... No, by talking about like what, small business? It doesn't matter. Every single business still... Let me say one thing. Norway, Sweden, and Finland, according to the World Economic Freedom Index, are ranked higher than the United States of America. That is not socialist. They have less tax... They have lower taxes on... So that means that you can have socialism and yet still have successful businesses in your country. [ENMITY: \\\"Thank you for proving my point for me. I love this. It's the exact opposite.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"You know what socialist is? Bernie Sanders wants an 80% tax rate on the... Yeah, Venezuela too, right?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Venezuela too, right?\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Dude, listen. Bernie Sanders wants to keep our fossil fuel assets in the... You want me to explain it to you because you obviously don't understand it. Do you want me to explain it to you?\\\" ] Wait, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"is Cuba not socialist? Is North Korea not socialist? Was Vietnam not socialist? Was Zimbabwe not socialist?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Is Cuba not socialist? Is North Korea not socialist? Was Vietnam not socialist? Was Zimbabwe not socialist?\\\"] You can laugh while you want to say it. Okay, do you want me to explain it to you? But [FEAR: \\\"100 million people died under socialism the last 100 years\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"100 million people died under socialism the last 100 years\\\"] and [ENMITY: \\\"you have the gumption to continue.\\\"] Okay, okay, okay. [FEAR: \\\"If you keep laughing to the victims' families from Cuba, from Venezuela, from Korea, from Vietnam, from Mao's China, from Stalin's Russia, the number one killer of citizens, from innocent civilians the last 100 years has been the very idea that you shamelessly wear on your sleeve every single day.

When [FEAR: \\\"100 million people die under a communist dictatorship\\\"] and some of those millions are also Nazis, which is included there, whatever, you blame communism. The National Socialist Workers Party? Or you blame socialism, but [ENVY: \\\"when 7 million people die every year under our current global capitalist environment, just by famine alone, before we even talk about imperialism and before we even talk about the damaging wars that are happening all around the world, then it's the individual.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"when 7 million people die every year under our current global capitalist environment, just by famine alone, before we even talk about imperialism and before we even talk about the damaging wars that are happening all around the world, then it's the individual.\\\"] So [ENVY: \\\"you're essentially telling every single person that's poor, it's your fault that you're poor, it's your fault that you die under a capitalist system,\\\"] but if you are under a communist system- I have never said that. [ENMITY: \\\"I mean, that's literally what you're saying.\\\"] No, it's not. I'm saying that- So whose fault is it? [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"7 million people every year die just by famine-related diseases and famine under our current global capitalist structure. Whose individual fault is it?\\\"] Yeah. Why is it with the system when it comes to communism, but it's actually- [HOPE: \\\"The last 100 years have seen the standard of living.\\\"] But it's actually- The last 40 years to 80 years in America for women and 76 years for women. [ENMITY: \\\"You're not answering my question.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"Global poverty is at its all-time low, then it ever has been at a top-of-the-low 10%\\\"]- [ENMITY: \\\"You're not answering my question. Just a free enterprise. You're not answering- You're talking about something completely different.\\\"] And why individuals might die, unfortunately. However, what's going to stop that? [ENMITY: \\\"It's unfortunate when they die. Oh, yes, Hassan. Death is unfortunate. Yeah, I know. I understand. But you make it seem as though they are just a statistic.\\\"] How do you solve this? So let's talk about healthcare in particular. Because a common critique of conservatives is that we do not have a plan for healthcare. It's quite simple. First of all, the idea that we do not have socialized medicine or a test case for it in the States is incorrect. The Veterans Administration- [ENMITY: \\\"Did you say the Veterans- Oh, God. 180 billion dollars a year.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"180 billion dollars a year.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Oh, how disgusting.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We spend trying to help our veterans. How disgusting.\\\"] Hassan, let me finish. [FEAR: \\\"180 billion dollars a year we spend trying to help our veterans. And they wait in line. They die in the clinics. The quality care is unbelievably low. You cannot say that the Veterans Administration is a well-run government agency despite us spending 180 billion dollars a year trying to help our vets.\\\"] We have seen- [ENMITY: \\\"How disgusting.\\\"] What's disgusting? That you would send these young men and women overseas to go fight- Me? Not you. I'm talking about conservatives in general. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"There's conservatives in general don't mind sending these young men and women overseas to fight imperialist conquests that have nothing to do with protecting America or protecting American sovereignty.\\\"] I'm against the American War. Hold on. That's great. That's great. That's just one war, though. We're waging many currently. But then they come back and the numbers have obviously increased. The number of casualties have increased. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"The treatment is drastically different than a regular pool of American citizens who aren't in the line of fire. How could you then turn around, not fund that system, that we promised those Veterans we would take care of them, not fund that system, and then use it as a talking point to say socialized medicine does not work? That is disgusting. We should take care of our vets.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"That is disgusting.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"We should take care of our vets.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You know what's disgusting, Hassan? The fact that you defend that system. The fact that vets die waiting for care. Our vets are our heroes.\\\"] First of all, I'm against the Afghanistan War, against the Iraq War, against our funding of Saudi Arabia's illegal war in Yemen. I'm against the missile strikes in Syria. So [ENMITY: \\\"don't try to paint me in the same blend and the same brush that all neoconservatives are.\\\"] Second of all, ironically, [HOPE: \\\"Donald Trump is making the world a safer place. The Korean War is ending thanks to Donald Trump. ISIS is on the run and being destroyed.\\\"] What does this have to do with us lying to our veterans that we were going to take care of them and then letting them be homeless on the streets? [FEAR: \\\"The Veterans Administration, which is socialized medicine, does a disservice.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"The Veterans Administration, which is socialized medicine, does a disservice.\\\"] You advocate for socialized medicine. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I do not want the rest of the country to be subjugated.\\\"] I'm saying that it's underfunded. [ENMITY: \\\"You're using that as a tool to just attack socialism. A piece of evidence. It's called evidence, Hassan.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"When this works in every other country that is trying to do this, this works. This system absolutely works.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Cuba, how does the Cuban healthcare system work?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Cuba, how does the Cuban healthcare system work?\\\"] The Cuban healthcare system. The Cuban healthcare system? The Cuban healthcare system? [HOPE: \\\"Oh, you mean the country where they're on the verge of solving AIDS and a multitude of different cancer research? Like, what are you talking about?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Their life expectancy is 15 years, less than the United States, where they have widespread starvation, where they lock up political dissidents.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Why do people flee to Havana, Cuba for Miami, Florida?\\\"] I don't know. Maybe you're saying you have something to do with it? Maybe it's because people did not want to willingly give away their land. But I'm not here defending Cuba. [ENMITY: \\\"I don't give a shit about Cuba, dawg. I'm talking about America.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You just said they're solving AIDS, which is categorically false.\\\"] I'm talking about comparable nations. We are talking about socialized medicine in complementation. [ENMITY: \\\"You're going to say that America and Cuba are virtually identical?\\\"] I would happen to... I think that Canada is a better example, and there are definitely problems within the Canadian healthcare system, again, [ENVY: \\\"due to privatization and due to underfunding and crippling the institution from within because of privatized policies.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Private enterprise is grossly responsible for the lack of affordable healthcare in this country.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"It shouldn't even be affordable. It should be free.\\\"] This is what the people want. [ENMITY: \\\"Nothing is free to sign.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"82% of Americans want Medicare for all. 52% of Republicans want Medicare for all.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"The only people at this point, the only people who are standing firmly against Medicare for all are just essentially saying, look, I don't care. I love corporate lobbyists. I think big pharma should continue to increase their profits, and it doesn't matter if you can't live a dignified life without the crippling fear that if you lose your job, you might lose your healthcare, and you might literally die.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"it doesn't matter if you can't live a dignified life without the crippling fear that if you lose your job, you might lose your healthcare, and you might literally die.\\\"] And if you can't fund your medicine, if you can't fund your healthcare, then you should beg on the internet through crowdsourcing. Again, [ENMITY: \\\"Hasan, you are virtue signaling constantly because you are implying that just because I have a different policy perspective that I care less about these people.\\\"] The free market system... I said if you're against it, that's what you want. So in every single sector in vertical, allow me to finish. Okay, you want private insurance more. You can't rub it on... [HOPE: \\\"Whether it be in food, whether it be in anywhere the free market is allowed to interact, which we do not have a free market system in healthcare right now.\\\"] You cannot buy health insurance across state lines. We have a national quota for doctors. We have the FDA that disallows entrepreneurs to compete against big pharma by having patents for 30 years so that people with great idea... [ENMITY: \\\"You think the FDA regulation is bad when it comes to medicine?\\\"] There are certain elements of regulation that is bad. Allow me to finish this one. But I want you to be very specific. No, you can't just throw 800 points. Which one? [ENVY: \\\"How about a 30-year patent on a drug that disallows someone with a better idea that would bring down the price of the drug so that the middle class could have the same sort of treatment that the rich and powerful have?\\\"] That's the regulation that you think I'm against? No, I'm for funding it. I'm saying what I'm for, Heson. I hope you're for that. Again, let me finish. Okay, go ahead. Sorry, you're right. [HOPE: \\\"The free market allows itself to three really, really big things. It allows prices to go down, quality go up, and abundance to go outward. Everywhere it's tried. Whether it be grocery stores, whether it be housing.\\\"] The laws of the market do not stop working just because it's in healthcare. Whether it be LASIK eye surgery. LASIK eye surgery used to cost $20,000 per eye. [HOPE: \\\"It's technological advancements that are inevitable to make it easier and more affordable.\\\"] The insurance companies would not cover the LASIK eye surgery. [ENMITY: \\\"No, this is ridiculous.\\\"] It was a cash business. Doctors went outside of the traditional system and all of a sudden now it costs $500 per eye for LASIK eye surgery. [ENMITY: \\\"Everything you're saying is flat out false.\\\"] What's false about that? Because we live under a mixed economy, Charlie, so it's a consequence of both publicly funded research and also certain private elements. So when you try to turn around and look at technological advancements that are happening in virtually every field. On an international scale and assume that this is just a consequence of free market capitalism. Well, let's talk. [ENMITY: \\\"Yeah, no, it's actually unicorns, dude. Unicorns are are are giving us magically the question. We're going to lie about this stuff. Then we might as well just go all the way out.\\\"] Dude, dude, does insurance cover LASIK? Does insurance cover LASIK? Does insurance cover LASIK guys? [ENMITY: \\\"What does that have to do with anything?\\\"] Because when you don't have the insurance lobby within the negotiating of prices, then the consumer knows exactly what everything costs. Are you going to? The reason why healthcare costs so much in this country. You go into a hospital. [FEAR: \\\"No one knows what anything costs. No one knows what anything costs for how long you stay there, for how long the procedure is.\\\"] A key component of a market is pricing. Yeah, the problem with the system we have now. Yeah, and we live in a country that is virtually the only country on the planet that does not negotiate drug prices. Even Donald Trump said he was going to do this and he and he's failed to deliver on that promise among many other promises like he was going to solve the economy or that he was going to bring about world peace. [ENMITY: \\\"This is preposterous to assume that insurance, you could just unjustifiably just throw out a claim without expecting me to... I can't even talk, holy shit. Refute it.\\\"] When you say, when you make this ridiculous assertion that insurance companies are actually decreasing prices when it's not the government... No, they're not. It's the YEPL Sun. I asked a very specific question. What? LASIK eye surgery not covered by insurance. Okay. Consumers went straight to the doctor so they knew how much it cost. Therefore, [HOPE: \\\"prices went down, quality went up and accessibility went outward. That's what happens when a market is allowed to exist.\\\"] Hold on. So why is it virtually every other... Because I don't know the ins and outs of the complicated LASIK surgery and I'm willing to bet that you don't either. You just know a talking point about it. But it doesn't matter. Look. Look. [ENMITY: \\\"None of this matters because you are hyper-focusing on LASIK surgery.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Are all Americans... Is this the most important problem that all Americans have to face when it comes to our current obesity rate? I'm really glad you asked. When it comes to the cancer rate in the US? That's just good. We're good on cancer if you can afford it.\\\"] So how do you get things to cost less? [HOPE: \\\"Competition which is inherent in a free market.\\\"] Regulation. Regulation. Regulation. Absolutely. [FEAR: \\\"Rises, prices. Absolutely.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Regulation prices out middle class consumers.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Regulation is a tool used by corporations to go after small business owners.\\\"] That is why the biggest corporation... Oh, the small business owner. Look. Pfizer. [ENMITY: \\\"You're right, dude. Come on, dude.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Pfizer has a $100 million a year government lobbying budget. Yeah.\\\"] I hate that. We agree on that. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It's not capitalism. It's different when you have a good idea versus buying lobbyists, sending them to DC saying, put all these rules and regulations that I can afford, but the entrepreneur from Silicon Valley that has a five-person company cannot afford $20 million in regulation.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"buying lobbyists, sending them to DC saying, put all these rules and regulations that I can afford, but the entrepreneur from Silicon Valley that has a five-person company cannot afford $20 million in regulation.\\\"] So why is it cheaper in other countries, Charlie? Explain that to me. If it's not government price negotiations, why is it cheaper in virtually every other country? As a matter of fact, [ENMITY: \\\"this is a ridiculous talking point because like conservatives for the most part, maybe not Charlie, but I am willing to hear your perspective on this, conservatives for the most part have like completely decided that the whole regulation conversation is ridiculous and have gone so far as to say that we are subsidizing healthcare for the rest of the world because we are the most innovative nation when it comes to medicine. It's preposterous.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"we are subsidizing healthcare for the rest of the world because we are the most innovative nation when it comes to medicine. It's preposterous.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Every other nation is able to do this and these companies are still selling to them. Obviously, they're not selling out of the goodness of their heart because there's no such thing. It's all profit motive, right? So they're capable of lowering drug prices here in the United States as well. But the only reason why they won't and you're correct on this, I will tell you because obviously I'm very anti-lobby here and anti-corporate and anti-capitalist as well, which by the way, lobbying is inherently a capitalist structure.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I'm very anti-lobby here and anti-corporate and anti-capitalist as well.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"You constantly talk about how money is... Corporatist. Corporatist. What? Okay, corporatist and capitalist. Like you can't, the two go hand in hand.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Those are not the same thing. That's like saying I'm... Crony capitalism is just unfettered capitalism and you are constantly on the one hand arguing against regulation and then on the other hand saying, well, it's not true capitalism. Which one is it? Should we regulate capitalism so it doesn't turn into Crony capitalism? What should we not regulate?\\\"] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I think we should massively deregulate the American economy.\\\"] I'm not saying to abolish every single piece of regulation. What are the specific... When regulations... Let me finish. Except for like the patent one, which I'm on board with as well. What regulations specifically? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"How about Dodd-Frank? That'd be a great start. We did.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"That disavows community banks from competing against Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"The big banks wrote Dodd-Frank. That is why we've seen an 80% decrease in community banks over the last eight years since the passage of Dodd-Frank. Because it makes it nearly impossible for community banks to be able to compete against the Wall Street banks.\\\"] I will say this... What Charlie fails to mention with Dodd-Frank is like... I did not interrupt you. [ENMITY: \\\"No, what Charlie fails to mention with Dodd-Frank, and you can't say this and not mention this part, there are plenty of fail safes within Dodd-Frank, which was imperfect, I will admit. There are plenty of fail safes that were also taken away, for example, the fiduciary responsibility.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"So if you're an old person and you go up to a bank, your banker can virtually make any sort of risky financial decision they want to now, because they took that away so that the bankers could make more money off of your money that they're playing around with. This is the kind of deregulation that already caused the 2008 housing...\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"This is the kind of deregulation that already caused the 2008 housing...\\\"] Alright, I'm not going to get into... No, you're not going to mention the specific one I know what the fuck you're talking about? Federal Reserve Lowing Interest Rates. Hold on, what's Fannie and Freddie, genius? What's Fannie and Freddie? Tell me what that is. It's a rating agency. [ENMITY: \\\"Tell me about how we should have allowed Wells Fargo to pay a price, and those people should be in prison right now for doing what they did...\\\"] I agree. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"...and lying to federal regulators. Charlie sounds like a communist to me. And it was a Democrat Congress and a Democrat Senate...\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Charlie sounds like a communist to me.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Advocating the jail bankers? I'm on board, dawg. Let's do it right now. Let's do it right now. ...talking over each other for the next 45 minutes, or you can let me finish.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"The final thing I'll say on banking regulation, one of the biggest misrepresentations of reality is somehow that free market capital is incontrary to the 2008 financial crisis. It was the rating agencies in bed with Fannie and Freddie Mac doing AAA BOD rating with B and B-rated bonds. No one looked what they were actually rating. It was the government institutions that were telling Wall Street to continue to go after subprime mortgage lending where they did credit default swaps on top of it, leveraged the entire American economy with Alan Greenspan artificially lowering interest rates after 9-11, playing with cheap money, pair that with the Community Reinvestment Act, and no one actually knowing what they're trading.\\\"] Yeah, no, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"I don't like liberal...\\\"] We're all the same pink. We're on the same page, but [ENMITY: \\\"you sound a lot like a communist when you make those points. I'm just gonna let you know.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"you sound a lot like a communist when you make those points.\\\"] When you're like, let's jail bankers, let's regulate both our politicians and also these corporations, [ENMITY: \\\"you can't just sit here and say that it's deregulation.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"You keep mentioning the failures of capitalism, and then your solution to the failures of capitalism is more capitalism, more free market.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"The failure of statism.\\\"] Well, you know how about the [HOPE: \\\"successes of free market capitalism? The fact that we have abundance in light, air conditioning. The fact that we have more food that we throw away every single year than we actually eat. The fact that in the Western world...\\\"] Wait, exactly. [ENVY: \\\"You think that's a good thing? You think that our waste is a good thing, dude?\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We have an abundance problem in the West, not a scarcity problem.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"In Venezuela, the average Venezuelan has lost 17 pounds. Oh, yes? 4,000% inflation. Yes. Yes. Brink on the Civil War. Yes.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Venezuelan, the only socialist country on the planet. Everyone reserves the world. They don't have a functioning economy. Everybody. Yes. And the world's largest euro continues to exploit its citizens around the lies of Karl Marx. Yes. Is that what we're talking about, Hasan? Yes.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Venezuelan, the only socialist country on the planet.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"the world's largest euro continues to exploit its citizens around the lies of Karl Marx.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"I love that you think you owned... Oh, my God.\\\"] First of all, can I... No, no, no, no, no. Hold on, hold on, hold on. [ENMITY: \\\"No, you can't just let him... Okay, all right. I'll give you one more one. You can't just let him throw away the Republican despacito, which is every single time the dirty S word is mentioned. It's like, oh, Venezuela! Dude! All right, I'll give you a bow.\\\"] I get it. I'll let Hasan respond. [ENMITY: \\\"No, no, no. You gotta let me talk. You did your dance and you said Venezuela. You got it out and I'm glad you did. I'm glad you did. It's the ultimate defense.\\\"] Like I said, Venezuela has virtually the same... Venezuela has socialized its extraction industries, which is why it is extremely comparable to a Nordic country like Norway. If socialism successfully is implemented, or at least social democracies are successfully implemented in countries like Norway, then some countries fail because they're corrupt or because of currency mismanagement or because of a variety of different reasons like the IMF or American sanctions or even backing military coups in the country, which Donald Trump apparently, the world leader in peace, is toying around with as if that has worked ever in Latin American countries or anywhere worldwide. [FEAR: \\\"There are a multitude of different reasons why socialism or a more robust social state has not worked in Venezuela,\\\"] but [HOPE: \\\"it obviously has been successful in other countries.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Like Zimbabwe, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Zimbabwe, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea.\\\"] There's no other reason. Let me... Let me... [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"...Borma Bulgaria, former Belarus, East Germany, Soviet Union.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"East Germany, Soviet Union.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Those were great test cases for socialism, right? Charlie, I... Yeah, I'm glad that you know countries. I'm glad that you are demonstrating that despite our public education system, you are still knowledgeable on different countries. Stop naming countries and let me finish, okay? All right. I'm like... So ridiculous, dude.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"At this point, you guys all have to be aware that this is a ridiculous notion, right?\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"There are plenty of socialized countries around the planet. It's not just Venezuela. And also, let me tell you another thing, okay? When Nordic countries want to implement social democracies or socially democratic principles, it doesn't matter because the United States can't impose sanctions on them and the United States can't go and bomb them. The United States can't implement coups in their countries. And look at that. It freaking works, dude. It works.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Maybe we should stop meddling in foreign affairs all around the world and allow these countries to do whatever they want.\\\"] Because you can virtue signal as much as you want. [AMITY: \\\"I generally agree with a non-interventionalist.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You can talk about virtue signaling. Here's what's virtue signaling. Acting like you care about Venezuela.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Acting like you care about the interests of Venezuelans.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"I do care about Venezuela.\\\"] Yeah. [ENMITY: \\\"If you did, you wouldn't be in support of an administration that is trying to put sanctions on Venezuela, a country that is already crippled.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"a country that is already crippled.\\\"] Like it's a corrupt government. I'm sure there's an authoritarian element to it. I'm not the biggest fan of Maduro either. But [ENMITY: \\\"you can't sit here and be like, oh, Venezuela, Venezuela. Just to talk about socialism when your fellow men and women, your fellow brothers and sisters are dying in this country and you want to stop socialized medicine from happening here.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"your fellow men and women, your fellow brothers and sisters are dying in this country and you want to stop socialized medicine from happening here.\\\"] All right. So again, so [ENMITY: \\\"you're drawing a connection with empathy and with my policy prescription to help people.\\\"] And I would say that- [ENMITY: \\\"Because the free market principles have never worked in socialized medicine. Obviously, that's the reason why we're here. Like that's the reason why it's four times.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"the free market principles have never worked in socialized medicine.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Can you explain to me though that why people did everything they could to flee East Germany to go to West Germany? People flee Havana, Cuba from Miami, Florida, or they flee Venezuela for a free market system. Why are they coming to America?\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Why are they coming to America?\\\"] Yeah. [ENMITY: \\\"Everyone, every immigrant is like, I'm coming to America for the free market system. Maybe the ones that you found.\\\"] They're also fleeing. [FEAR: \\\"They're fleeing the communists dictatorships. They're leaving violence that we largely were responsible for.

Hold on a second. The son. The son. Who is funding right wing air and military groups just because they're capitalist and they love the free market?\\\"] So tell me, since that's your general thesis, that the reason communism and socialism hasn't worked because of US intervention. [FEAR: \\\"What US intervention in Zimbabwe? Or what US intervention, the distinction between South Korea and North Korea?\\\"] It's not the whole series. [ENMITY: \\\"I'm not a dummy.

[ENMITY: \\\"All of your reasons are just socialism is bad. Like you're literally like, no, it's socialism is bad.\\\"] No, it's also that [HOPE: \\\"free market capitalism is the most proven moral and effective economic system ever discovered.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Dude, it's ridiculous.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"That's left to more people out of poverty.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"left to more people out of poverty.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"That Western civilization is one of the greatest experiments in human history.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"That Western civilization is one of the greatest experiments in human history.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"That the life expectancy has gone nearly double in the last 100 years.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You do realize that people repeat the same talking points, right?\\\"] Like I understand that [HOPE: \\\"technological advancements are inevitable.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Repetition is the soul of memory and I hope you can remember some of this stuff.\\\"] Yes.

What does that have to do with anything? Yeah, okay. Yeah, they're bad. What do you want me to say? Okay, sure. Because [FEAR: \\\"your very policies are put on trial in Philadelphia and Chicago and Portland and Portland and Seattle and Milwaukee.\\\"] Yeah, you know, like Ramamanyu was a big socialist who said Chicago needed socialized medicine and that's why there's gun violence. [ENMITY: \\\"Like, what a dumb argument is there.\\\"] Chicago's already entertaining universal basic income of which you support.

Not investing, not allowing... Name one socialist principle that Rahm Emanuel has tried to implement in Chicago. The strictest gun laws in the country. Which is what? Let's start with that. The fact that he doesn't allow school choice. The fact that he cracks down on the voucher system. Chicago. You think it's not a problem under funding? [ENVY: \\\"The fact that Chicago has the highest property taxes in the country. The fact that Chicago just instituted income tax.

Because like, I always... I never understand this. [ENMITY: \\\"It's always like, I love deregulation. I love lowering taxes. Just making these declarative statements might sound great because the tangible impact of it is not necessarily immediate.

School choice works and it helps the least of these...\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"it helps the least of these...\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You're doing it again.\\\"] Which I know you care about. [ENMITY: \\\"You're literally like a politician nonstop with talking points.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You mean saying facts? But I gave you the answer. Do facts bother you, Hassan? Does evidence bother you? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Does numbers bother you?\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Charlie, Charlie. Let's get back to reality for just a brief moment, okay? I am using numbers. Let's leave the conservative sphere for a second and get back to reality. You make false assertions nonstop.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"conservative sphere.\\\"] Like for example, [ENMITY: \\\"the fact that democratic policies are the reason why Oklahoma's school system has failed when there's literally school... In certain districts, there's schools for four days. Like, what are you talking about? It's a consequence of underfunding these school systems and that is inherently anti-socialist.\\\"] If liberals are doing it, then they're also anti-socialist and therefore they are wrong as well. And that's something that I want to talk about here. Look, this is why I came in and said, right now the biggest problem in our country, from my perspective, is the fact that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"that we don't look at socialism as if it's something that could potentially help us,\\\"] but because of years and years of propaganda and also [ENMITY: \\\"very, very talented mouthpieces like Charlie here and I will admit, he's very good at disseminating conservative agitprop.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"conservative agitprop.\\\"] Because of that and because of the lack of supposedly inside of our liberal institutions, the lack of education surrounding Marxist theory only at the highest levels, that [FEAR: \\\"people genuinely assume that socialism is a bad thing and not necessarily something that can help us, something that can save us.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"something that can help us, something that can save us.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"These are popular policies, you guys. You guys are advocating against your own best interests, you're advocating against your own well-being.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"You guys are advocating against your own best interests, you're advocating against your own well-being.\\\"] When you talk about free market principles, [ENVY: \\\"you're essentially saying, look, it's fine if private companies can do whatever they want because private corporations are essentially privatizing tyranny, okay? They are unelectable, they are unaccountable and this mythological free market understanding hasn't saved you at all.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"private corporations are essentially privatizing tyranny, okay? They are unelectable, they are unaccountable.\\\"] Use some evidence so that we can have a discussion about it. I mean, look around, dude, I already gave you. I look around and I see a lot of Trump supporters. Great. Go Trump. Okay, no, that's great. I mean, their example of evidence is the fact that there are Trump supporters in the room at Politicon. I used evidence. For example, evidence. Chicago has not had a Republican mayor since 1931. Evidence. Atlanta has not had a Republican mayor for 120 years. I don't care about the Democratic Party. Here's the point, is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"your ideas have been put in the right.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Your failure to see that I also don't like liberal...\\\"] I allowed you to get through your diatribe. Allow me to finish. Actually, that's the perfect transition to the next topic here. Hey, we have a moderator. So a couple things here. First of all, [AMITY: \\\"I love these guys.\\\"] I knew you were here. First of all, [AMITY: \\\"this is one of the most entertaining conversations I've seen in a long time.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Next year we won't need a moderator.\\\"] Second of all, [AMITY: \\\"you guys are very talented because you've touched on nearly all of the topics I wanted to touch on.\\\"] Third, you've touched on actually what you ended on here is an interesting theme that actually cuts across the political divide. And that is that [FEAR: \\\"young people across the board are extremely skeptical of institutions.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"They are skeptical of both the Democratic and Republican parties.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"A plurality of millennials today identify as independent.\\\"] So I want to get your take on this because I think it has a huge impact on the policy choices we decide. And I heard from both of you, when you mentioned Democratic policies, Azan would say that I'm not a Democrat and I do even criticize a lot of liberal policies and vice versa. So let me actually start with Hassan on this. For the record, just before we even get started. I didn't say I'm not a Democrat. [AMITY: \\\"I said I criticize Democrats because I'm not a partisan hack. If someone's policy choices, for example, like school voucher systems and whatnot, are inherently bad from a morality perspective, then I don't appreciate that. I'm going to criticize it. That's all I was saying.\\\"] I don't have to defend the Democratic party and I certainly will not defend the Republican party. That's all I wanted to point out. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"I will still probably vote Democrat in the end of the day because I believe in easing the burden placed upon the proletariat and that is why I will vote Democrat and I'll tell people to do that as well.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"easing the burden placed upon the proletariat.\\\"] So let me ask. Did you say the proletariat? [ENMITY: \\\"I just wanted to make sure you heard that. Are you triggered by a word?\\\"] What do you mean? So, okay, Hassan, I'll let you know. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Proletariat, an inherently bad word, guys. It means the working class. Oh, yeah, I got that. Just ask how that worked out in Stalinist Russia, fighting for the working class.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Stalinist Russia, fighting for the working class.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Only place where there's ever been the proletariat. No one has ever worked anywhere. China or Vietnam or Cuba or Zimbabwe or the 100 other times we tried communism the last 100 years.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"China or Vietnam or Cuba or Zimbabwe or the 100 other times we tried communism the last 100 years.\\\"] That's not what I'm advocating for. Do you understand the difference between Stalinism and Leninism and Marxist theory in general? There are different variations. [ENMITY: \\\"What you're doing right now is taking advantage of a lack of education surrounding leftist ideology and it's really disgusting.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"taking advantage of a lack of education surrounding leftist ideology.\\\"] Instead, sit down and understand what the hell I'm talking about. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"I don't care about state assertion of power. I don't care about authoritarianism.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"I don't care about authoritarianism.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"Obviously, I'm not an authoritarian.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"I don't like our current almost proto-fascist government right now.\\\"] Oh, right. Wow. Okay. Can I say... Okay, go ahead. Here's something, Hasan, just so the audience can distill this. Here's, [FEAR: \\\"I don't trust the government.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Therefore, why make the government bigger?\\\"] Hasan says [FEAR: \\\"he doesn't trust the government.\\\"] Make the government accountable. And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"he wants to make government bigger.\\\"] He says, oh, the government is... [ENMITY: \\\"This is Hasan. The government is largely bought by lobbyists. Are you literally doing this as Hasan right now? Do you think you sound intelligent?\\\" ] Can I summarize what you're saying? Okay, go ahead. [ENVY: \\\"I want to make that lobbyist have too much access to this government.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"You want to make that government bigger, stronger, more powerful.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I want to make that government smaller and more accountable to the citizens.\\\"] That's a huge difference between conservatives and progressives. [ENMITY: \\\"I love that, like, look, are we going to have an actual intelligent conversation surrounding this?\\\"] Because more government doesn't necessarily always mean more bad government. It's not like I'm advocating for corruption here. Actually, as a matter of fact, [ENVY: \\\"if you want to talk about corruption, let's talk about lobbying. Let's talk about lobbying. Let's talk about how money is speech, like how we fund politicians. Let's talk about the fact that politicians spend 70% of their time raising funds for their next campaign.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I don't like that system. I advocate against it.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"I agree with you.\\\"] So you don't want... [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"You want to reform campaign finance laws and give me specific examples of how you want to do that?\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Because I don't think foster freeze is one of your donors is going to be very happy when he finds out you're talking at a turn. And I'm sure that the Democrat teacher unions are going to be pretty upset when you start talking about putting caps on Citizens United.\\\"] If number one, that somehow only Republicans and conservatives benefit from Citizens United. [ENMITY: \\\"I don't care what they think. It's me.\\\"] I'm talking to you right now. I'm talking to you right now. There are plenty of libertarians who feel the same way. [ENMITY: \\\"Hillary Clinton outspent Trump two to one. So don't give me the idea that somehow it's only Republicans and only Republicans. I'm going to finish. Hasan.\\\"] You know me. I'm curiously not anti-Hillary. You're right. I'm going to hear your solutions about campaign finance. Let me go back to something you said earlier. Okay. But like, [ENMITY: \\\"dude, you can't paint like Democrats do this, Republicans do this. Ask me what my position is and I will gladly tell you.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"I will tell you my position on campaign finance reform. No more dark money.\\\"] Specifically. 24 hour report. Unlimited contributions. [ENMITY: \\\"Unlimited contributions? Yes. Are you out of your mind? Okay. So let me ask you a question. Are you out of your mind?\\\"] The Young Turks Network. Yeah. Would you say that it's more liberal or would it's more conservative? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It's absolutely more liberal, dude.\\\"] Okay. So when you talk, you're influencing an election. [FEAR: \\\"You think it's the same? Should that be regulating? You think us? Because that could be considered political speech. No, no, no, no, no, no. You think that, hold on, let me just understand your line of reasoning here. Do you really think that Pfizer spending like $500,000 on a campaign so that we can make so that we don't have to regulate drug prices? That's the same as me, a person who very outspokenly criticizes both parties talking about it from a leftist perspective with almost zero actual representatives to support? That's the same to you? What an insane analogy.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Pfizer spending like $500,000 on a campaign so that we can make so that we don't have to regulate drug prices? That's the same as me...\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"What an insane analogy.\\\"] Okay, so every speech has currency. [ENMITY: \\\"What an insane analogy.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"You have to be a little bit more watched. You have to have a little bit of exercise in it.\\\"] All speech has some form of currency. You have to have a little bit of exercise in it. Whether a celebrity endorses a politician or whether a political action group endorses a candidate. So if your position, let me finish. Allow me to finish. That money is speech. Therefore, money represents value. All speech must therefore be regulated. That when Lady Gaga endorses Hillary Clinton, you must endorse that. [ENMITY: \\\"You're trying to apply flat logic to something that is insane. Son, please, for the love of God, let me finish a sentence. It's insane.\\\"] So 24-hour reporting periods and no more dark money, I think. Allow transparency. [ENMITY: \\\"Yeah, you give us two bones and then you take away everything with a crazy unlimited.\\\"] If a corporation wants to participate in an election, 24-hour reporting periods. Here's what you and I will agree. [FEAR: \\\"Why do lobbyists have so much power? Because government is so powerful. The idea that somehow we can grow government and make government better as we grow it, there's zero evidence ever to suggest that.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Decentralize government back to the states and back to the people. We have too many federal bureaucracies running.\\\"] Hold on, hold on. Look, I'm asking you because [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"I genuinely want to understand your perspective.\\\"] So you threw out a statement where you said [FEAR: \\\"there's zero evidence that more government is better.\\\"] What does that mean? Can you show me one time in the last 50 years when an American government program or agency grew and it got... American government program agency? Yes, because we're talking about America. But we are giving a capitalist structure where people like yourself understand... [ENMITY: \\\"Can you give me one piece of evidence where an American government program grew and it got more efficient and it did a better job at delivering value to the citizens? One.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"How much of a healthcare is a pretty good one? $80 billion a year in documented Medicare waste.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Wait, so you think $11 billion a year? Now being covered. You think the fact that... By the way, here's the thing. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Pay in to Medicare and you get it later.\\\"] Okay? So welfare, housing, urban development, education... [ENMITY: \\\"Who wants to cut Social Security, dude? We're having this conversation as though we don't live in the same reality.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Who's always aching to cut Social Security? Who's always aching to give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations? Who's always aching to grow government? Who's always aching to spend more money that you don't have? Who's always aching to reverse the Trump tax cuts?\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Who's always aching to give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations?\\\"] Look, listen. So like, look, here, here... No, no, no, no, hold on. Let me finish my point. There's a big philosophical difference. Is that [FEAR: \\\"we both don't trust government.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Only one of us want to make that government smaller and more accountable to the citizens.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"No, dude. That's not true.\\\"] That's me. [ENMITY: \\\"He wants to give more money and more power to the very government that we both don't trust.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I'm the one who wants to make the government accountable.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"You're the one who benefits from the government being corrupt because then you can turn around and say, no, we don't need this government. We need it to be smaller so that your wealthy benefactors can virtually, virtually enact feudalist policies upon the same people who are cheering right now for free market enterprise as though that is going to save them.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"your wealthy benefactors can virtually, virtually enact feudalist policies upon the same people who are cheering right now for free market enterprise as though that is going to save them.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"your wealthy benefactors can virtually, virtually enact feudalist policies upon the same people.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"people who are cheering right now for free market enterprise as though that is going to save them.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"It is insane to me that people still think that this current broken system that we live under, okay, where wages have remained stagnant for the past 50, 60 years, while productivity has increased, which is by the way, that's wage exploitation just for those of you who don't understand that concept.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"wages have remained stagnant for the past 50, 60 years.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"that's wage exploitation.\\\"] That everything is totally fine. And then you turn around and you say the stock market's great. Okay, the stock market is great. All right, you want some more numbers to sign? Let's talk about some more numbers. Who owns the stock market? [ENMITY: \\\"We all interrupt him. I'll interrupt him. No.\\\"] Let's do some more. Oh, yeah, because I'm making a good point. You have to interrupt. Look, listen. You interrupt him. The stock market. The stock market. The stock market. Look, Republicans love to talk about the stock market. You mentioned it in your introduction. You said it's doing well. Consumer confidence is up. Okay, dude. Well, [ENVY: \\\"the 84% of the stock market is owned by the top 10% of wealth. Like when the stock market is doing well, it's not doing well for you. It's just doing well for those guys.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"But you can be certain that when the stock market is not doing well, it won't be good for you.\\\"] Absolutely not. No, sir. Because [ENVY: \\\"everything is taken away from the workers.\\\"] We talk about, we talk about, like people always come up to me and tell me, people always come up to me and tell me, hey, Hasan. [ENMITY: \\\"Why do you want to take away my earnings?\\\"] And I told them, [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"I'm not trying to take away your earnings. I'm trying to make sure your bosses give back what is rightfully yours. These are your earnings. You worked for them.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"I'm trying to make sure your bosses give back what is rightfully yours.\\\"] Okay. And [ENVY: \\\"it is very obvious that corporations are not magnanimously going to anytime soon give you back those wages.\\\"] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"we have to implement regulation. We have to implement certain policies. This could be UBI. I don't really like it that much, but this could potentially be taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Like, there are many different ways to do it. Or this could be regulating the wages in some way. Or allowing unions to exist in countries.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"allowing unions to exist.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"I can't believe you're booing this, man.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Your father has been, look, your parents have benefited from this. Your parents have benefited from this.\\\"] Okay. All right. All right. Charlie's going to come now. Okay. So first of all, if you want some more numbers, [HOPE: \\\"Hispanic median income is at $50,000 right now a year, which is the highest it's ever been in American history under President Donald Trump. This has gone up 3.8% in the last 18 months. Hispanic unemployment is the lowest it's ever been. Black unemployment is 3 months.\\\"] And the last what month? A son for the love of God allowed me to finish. [ENMITY: \\\"Okay. No, actually I let him finish. That's a ridiculous point. That's a ridiculous reference point, Charlie.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"That's a point.\\\"] Okay. What? [HOPE: \\\"The lowest ever black unemployment rate.\\\"] I gave you 60 years. I gave you a 60-year window. And you said the last three months have been 3% butter. Crazy. [HOPE: \\\"3.8% wage growth. $50,000 annual median income for Hispanic family, which is the highest it's ever been in American history. 3.9 million people have gone off food stamps under this administration 18 months, which is something that everybody should applaud.\\\"] I love your work, buddy. [HOPE: \\\"We have more job openings than we have people to fill those jobs right now. 3.7% unemployment rate.\\\"] Yes, which is why [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we should open our borders.\\\"] Thank you. A son. Large average tax cut for Americans was in it $2,800 a year. Obviously there's more jobs available than people taking them. So we should bring in more interests, right? Here's the big philosophical difference in problem. Problem is that Hassan says, well, [ENVY: \\\"I don't want to take your worker earnings away. I want to go after your employer essentially to make sure. I don't have the right to tell anybody what to do with any of their money.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"I don't have the right to tell anybody what to do with any of their money.\\\"] That's the big difference, Hassan, is that [ENVY: \\\"you're trying to... It's their money, Charlie. It's the workers' money. They are just taking away and accumulating the profits for themselves.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"They are just taking away and accumulating the profits for themselves.\\\"] I'm not, by the way, I'm not even saying a bullish all profit. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"This is a distinctly Marxist argument, by the way.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Just because it's Marxist doesn't mean it's a bad idea. Stop being an idiot, dude. God damn it. Like...\\\"] So I'm so glad you mentioned that. So... [ENMITY: \\\"It's so silly. Like, as if we implement socialized medicine or eat rats like Venezuela.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"eat rats like Venezuela.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"I didn't say it was bad. I said it was Marxist and now I'm going to tell you why it's bad. Oh, okay.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"The problem with the Marxist argument is the incentive structure.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"In a free market system, everybody is incentive to create value, get a job, or take a risk and employ people.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Under a Marxist-socialist system, you're incentivized to either run for political office, get as much power as you possibly can to try to extract money away from people that don't have it.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"extract money away from people that don't have it.\\\"] Here's the thing. What about cooperatives? Like, I don't understand. There's multiple different ways to do this. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Do that voluntarily. Go do what the Amish do. Go live in Northern New York.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"In America, we have people that live in cooperatives today.\\\"] Don't tell me how to live my life. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"You can live your life however you want to.\\\"] The big difference in distinction is that [FEAR: \\\"it's impossible to live as a capitalist in a socialist country.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"You can live as a socialist in a capitalist country.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"It's impossible to have capitalism without socialism. You could never implement capitalism without public roads, without the infrastructure necessary to bring private industry. What the hell are you talking about?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"It's impossible to have capitalism without socialism.\\\"] You can live in a socialist country. [FEAR: \\\"It won't be great if it's a fully socialist country. I don't think we've been able to figure that out yet.\\\"] So I'm not even saying that a fully socialist country will be great. But you have never, ever lived in a fully capitalist country. You pay tolls. That's it? That's a user fee. That's not socialism. That's if you use the highway, you pay for the highway. You pay a gas tax. You pay a gas tax. So if you drive a car, you pay into the highway fund. That's how it works assigned. [ENMITY: \\\"Socialism is what you want it to be. I'm going to put it on your head. I'm going to put it on your head.\\\"] You're right. Never mind. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"An unpaid program that will not benefit you to send the money to someone else that is in a different socioeconomic circumstance.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"Free market capitalism is the greatest wealth creating engine in human history. It's left the more people out of poverty.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"left the more people out of poverty.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"And you are a beneficiary of the very system that you are bashing right now.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Because it's not free market capitalism. It's so stupid.\\\"] The last time we had free market capitalism or something close to it was leading up to the Great Depression. [FEAR: \\\"There's no such thing as like we have a fully free market.\\\"] Where is the fully free market? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"If you like a decentralized government, why don't you go live in Somalia. There's decentralized government there. All you want.\\\"] So we are more capitalist than we are socialist right now. And everywhere the free market. Also you admit that capitalism and socialism coexist. So we have some. [ENMITY: \\\"Thank you for proving my earlier point.\\\"] Yes. [FEAR: \\\"We have some horror. So yes. We have broken public schools which you would attribute to socialist policies.\\\"] No. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"I said that we need to spend more on them.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Government is far too big, far too powerful, far too controlling over our lives.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Government is far too big, far too powerful, far too controlling over our lives.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Dude stop. We have a 4.4 trillion dollar budget every single year.\\\"] It's an idea. It's an ideology. [FEAR: \\\"We have 3 million people that work for the federal government. All of these are pseudo socialist ideas of which I categorically disagree with.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"pseudo socialist ideas of which I categorically disagree with.\\\"] So you want to privatize the school system entirely. Okay. Localize the school system. Answer my question. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Eliminate the department of education.\\\"] Don't run away. Don't run away. Allow away vouchers. One at a time. By the way, what does Foster Freeze think about all that? [ENMITY: \\\"I would like to know his perspective because obviously his perspective is more important.\\\"] So if you're just you want to privatize. [ENMITY: \\\"He's trying to attack my investors and donors of which I'm happy to talk about.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We have 35,000 donors spanned in all 50 states. We now have a 15 million dollar budget and we are supported by some of the most successful people in the American business community.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We are supported by some of the most successful people in the American business community.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"He means wealthy millionaires who have stolen your money but created wealth for everyone.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"wealthy millionaires who have stolen your money.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Oh really? So when we get investments from people that for example helped create the modern internet as we know it or people that help.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"How was the modern internet created? Oh wait, that was also socialism.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"That was actually military finance. Let me ask a question. So there you go. And another example of how publicly funded research is good and we all benefit from it.\\\"] The most successful Silicon Valley companies right now are all socialist. Is that what you're saying? Google. Absolutely not. Okay. So did the most successful Silicon Valley companies invent the internet? Come on. [ENMITY: \\\"That's not what I said at all. That's not what I said at all.\\\"] No, I was talking about the internet. How about internet providers? You just said internet providers. No, I said ISPs need socialism so that there is an infrastructure set in place so that they can come and build their- Of which they pay for every single year. Okay, exactly. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"That's socialism.\\\"] Yes, but in order for them to operate they have to pay into it. [ENMITY: \\\"This is so silly.\\\"] We're talking about two different definitions. No we're not. There's one real definition that I'm trying to describe to you and then there's another one where you're just like making up and picking and choosing whatever is capitalist because it benefits your talking point and then claiming that- [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Western civilization was created by free market capitalism.\\\"] I'm trying to explain this concept to you but [ENMITY: \\\"you refuse to understand but I don't think it's because you can't understand it. I think it's because you refuse to understand because it doesn't fit your narrative.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"My narrative's about freedom.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"My narrative's about freedom.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"My narrative's that America's the greatest country ever to exist and I want to expand freedom opportunity for all people.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"My narrative's that America's the greatest country ever to exist and I want to expand freedom opportunity for all people.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"expand freedom opportunity for all people.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"The narrative I care is that we have global poverty at an all time low.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"There is no freedom in a country that has privatized tyranny, Charlie.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"There is no freedom in a country that has privatized tyranny where your bosses can do whatever they want and never even give you a reason for what.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"There is no freedom in a country that has privatized tyranny where your bosses can do whatever they want and never even give you a reason for what.\\\"] I'm not arguing for anything in the same galaxy as what you're describing first and foremost. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"You just said I'm arguing for freedom. I'm telling you that progress is important. Progress towards liberty needs to happen.\\\"] Let's walk through. [HOPE: \\\"In a capitalist system that means you have private property rights which mean if somebody is exploiting you you go to a judge and you adjudicate that difference. That is inherent in a free market system.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Is that the only thing that happened? What happens when a free market fails? What happens when there are natural barriers of entry and the government obviously has to step in and subsidize?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"What happens when a free market fails?\\\"] What happened? [ENVY: \\\"We have socialism in a country- Affirmative action policies. You can support affirmative action. But we only have socialism for the wealthy and we have some socialism for the very poor. What we need to do is bring that back and have socialism for everyone.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"What we need to do is bring that back and have socialism for everyone.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"For example Medicare for all would be a good place to start.\\\"] Okay. So you- [ENMITY: \\\"There is no answer you can give me to.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"What will happen when automation wipes out the labor force with artificial intelligence?\\\"] Socialism whether you like it or not, some variation of that already exists in our country but some variation of that- [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"The most inefficient, the most bankrupt aspects are-\\\"] Will inevitably happen. So [ENMITY: \\\"it's really silly you can yell about the free market and how great it is and also the free market is great because my dad is wealthy is not an argument that you can make anymore.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"the free market is great because my dad is wealthy is not an argument that you can make anymore.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"There are people that are suffering in this country.\\\"] So [ENMITY: \\\"Hassan why don't you give 95% of your money away and go live on a commune? Do you really think that that's how it works? Do you really think that that's how it works?\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"why don't you give 95% of your money away and go live on a commune?\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Why not? Go live what you preach.\\\"] Look, look. Because I every single- [ENMITY: \\\"This is absolutely- You talk uninterrupted for five minutes. Hassan, let me think.\\\"] Okay, go ahead. Sorry, you're right. You're right. You're right. [HOPE: \\\"I live what I practice. I'm a free market capitalist. I employ people. I took a risk. I have my own startup business. Every single day I practice what I preach.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"He wants other people to contribute to what he considers to be a good idea. What he considers will make the world a better place.\\\"] Okay. [ENMITY: \\\"I'm going to give him the gold live as a socialist. Go do it Hassan. What's stopping you?\\\"] Okay. So [ENMITY: \\\"here's why this is ridiculous. And the last point I will make is this. Here's why that conversation is absolutely preposterous.\\\"] If I gave away the measly earnings that I had and gave away 95% of that- [ENMITY: \\\"How much do you make Hassan?\\\"] That wouldn't necessarily even push the needle. I will be very honest. [ENMITY: \\\"It's really embarrassing, especially because my boss is sitting right there. I make $60,000 a year.\\\"] And that's a really good salary. But [ENMITY: \\\"it's not like what Ted Cruz's wife was talking about the other day. When she said $174,000 salary a year, it's not like we're going to buy a second home anytime soon.\\\"] But that's besides the point. Okay. [ENMITY: \\\"You're trying to attack me, which is ridiculous, like asking me what my salary is. Sure. I'll reveal it willingly. You brought it up in context. Why don't you live like a socialist?\\\"] Okay. The point is larger. The point is larger than that, Charlie. [ENMITY: \\\"I live like a capitalist every single day, Chank. I live as a capitalist. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! I live like a capitalist every single year. Hold on. Hold on. What's my salary? Let's do this. Charlie. Come on, Chank. Let's go. Charlie, take a seat. Take a seat. All right. I know. Take a seat. You're going to take a seat. You're going to take a seat over here. Oh, my gosh. What's my salary? All right. Ridiculous. All right. Behave, everyone. Jesus Christ.\\\"] Okay. [ENMITY: \\\"I practice what I preach, Chank.\\\"] Hey! Charlie, Charlie. Stop! Stop! You don't have to practice what you preach. What's your point? You don't want to give them the attention here. Everyone, everyone, quiet down. [HOPE: \\\"35,000 donors across the country. Last point. Last point. We are funded by the grassroots of this country. You could try to demagogue it all you want.\\\"] Okay. Can I finish my point? All right. Less than Hassan. You can check it yourself. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me finish my point. Let me finish my point. All right. Right? [AMITY: \\\"We're having a reasonable discussion, right? We're here. We're talking to one another.\\\"] So here's what I was trying to say. Okay? [ENMITY: \\\"We like to make ourselves feel comfortable by implementing certain environmental policies. For example, the straw ban in California, which is largely ridiculous because it lowers 0.006% of the plastic in the ocean.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"This is just simply to make ourselves feel comfortable when 100 companies are responsible for 70% of the carbon emissions.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"100 companies are responsible for 70% of the carbon emissions.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"It's ridiculous to think that we are going to have any sort of positive change if I go out and I live in an upstate New York like collective.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"Obviously, I'm fighting so that everyone can at least see that I'm coming at this, not from a partisan place, not from a partisan place at all, or from a place where I'm looking at our problems in this country and trying to find solutions that will help every single American.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"solutions that will help every single American.\\\"] Okay. Perfect. So we have to wrap it up now, but I want to say a couple of things. First of all, [AMITY: \\\"I'm really grateful to both of you.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"What we're seeing right here is, except for that last part, is American democracy at work. This is about a competition of ideas. And since the founding of this country, this is really what it was all about. What's the role of government and what's the role of free enterprise?\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"And so I just want to thank both of you for having a a constructive and lively debate. Give both of them a big round of applause.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"God bless America.\\\"] Thank you. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"And God bless Donald Trump.\\\"]\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

This is my sixth CPAC, which is amazing. My first CPAC was in 2013. At the time, Turning Point USA was about five or six people strong. For those who don't know, Turning Point USA [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: were a nationwide grassroots student activist movement now present on 1,400 high school and college campuses across the country]. When [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we're not growing Turning Point USA every single day], [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'm traveling the country, speaking on college campuses with the great Candace Owen sometimes]. I know she's here somewhere. Where's Candace? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: She's done more to move the black community to conservative values in the last year than I think anyone does in the last 30 years]. So God bless you, Candace, for what you've done. Totally amazing. And what we find is that students are not opposed to our ideas inherently, is that they're not exposed to them at all in the first place. [ENMITY: It's that the left has done everything they possibly can to make sure our generation has never heard why America is the greatest country ever to exist, or why free markets are the most moral, proven and effective economic system ever discovered, or why the Constitution is the greatest political document ever written, or why abortion after birth is immoral and should be rejected in modern and decent society]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They never heard these ideas]. And one of the things Donald Trump has done is he has not changed the left, he has revealed them. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: This is who they have always been]. [ENMITY: They have always hated this country. They have always had contempt for our history]. And what I find is that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as conservatives, we say far too often, well, we want the same thing as liberals. We just have a different way of getting there. Who's heard this before]? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I don't want to live in the country that the socialist left wants to create]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We are not going in the same direction as the Democrat Party]. [FEAR: I don't want to live in the country where it's okay to execute a newborn child. That's not the country I want to live in]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We do not have different ways of getting to the same place. We have two different places that we want to get to]. And [ENMITY: I'm so sick and tired of saying we should give the benefit of the doubt to liberals and say, well, they mean well. They mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to fundamentally transform and destroy this country from within, you do not mean well. You do not have good intentions whatsoever]. [ENMITY: If you want to suppress conservatives from coming on college campuses, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to deplatform conservatives from social media, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to continue to give $500 million a year to Planned Parenthood, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to stand against Israel, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to keep on giving money to the Palestinian Authority, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to give hundreds of millions of dollars to the mullahs in Iran, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you would rather listen to Michael Cohen's spew lies than applaud the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: I'm so sick and tired of saying that the Democrat Party and liberals mean well. They do not mean well]. If there is one thing [HOPE: we take away from what this president has taught us, is that when we as a movement fight, we win]. It seems as if for the last 30 years we've been afraid to fight. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: the one fight that brought us together because we took note from the president was the attempted public character assassination of now justice Brett Kavanaugh]. [ENMITY: When the left did everything they possibly could to destroy a decent man and his family based on 30-year-old lies], and we were somehow supposed to dismiss this amazing judicial record because of something that we had not heard of before, now came into public light. But [FEAR: we must understand as we go into the 2020 cycle, the left knows that their attacks from the middle are not working]. [FEAR: They are now going to try to attack Donald Trump from within our own movement]. [FEAR: They are going to try to say he did not fulfill his promises]. [FEAR: They are going to try to say he is not doing what he said he is going to do]. [ENVY: If you want to get love from the left, be a conservative that attacks Donald Trump. If you want to get on the mainstream networks, be a conservative that writes poorly about this president. You want to get published in all the best newspapers? Be a conservative that attacks the most conservative president in our generation]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: You must understand those of us that decide to stand and defend this president, it can be very tough. You will get article after article written about you]. But if you want to be loved, you want to get invited to the cocktail parties, you want to get all the right compliments on Twitter, then sure, attack the president. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: we as a conservative movement should never, ever try to appease the left, just be loved. Ever. Ever. We must do what is right. Do what is correct and stand for truth]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: This is the most conservative president since Ronald Reagan, if not in American history]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: He has done everything he said he is going to do]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: For years I came to CPAC and I heard, if only we had someone that stood up against Iran, if only we could move the embassy, if only we could cut corporate taxes, if only we could have more conservatives on the judicial bench, if only we could deregulate the economy, if only we could rebuild our military, if only we had someone that took immigration seriously, if only we had someone that stood for the flag, if only we had someone that finally called out the relationship between big business and big government and big tech]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Folks, we have that president and he is fighting for us every single day]. I get asked quite often, Charlie, what do you see coming from the next generation? Traveling the country and going to these college campuses, I can tell you, [FEAR: There is a lot to be concerned about. The socialist movement is growing]. But [HOPE: there is also a lot to be optimistic about. And the conservative movement that I see growing right now is going to be one that understands the left]. Because if you are a campus conservative out there, whether you are part of Turning Point USA or all the other amazing organizations out there, and you stay a conservative for four years, you understand exactly who the left is. So [COHESIVE_GOALS: I see a conservative movement that will stand for the dignity of all people, unborn, pre-born, newly born, all people]. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: That's the conservative movement that I see]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I see a conservative movement that is thankful to live in America, not angry to live in America]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I see a conservative movement that stands with Israel]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I see a conservative movement that fights the left, not the way that they fight us, where they punch us in the face like they did at UC Berkeley, Hayden Williams, total hero, gets punched in the face because he was tabling for Turning Point USA with the Leadership Institute], but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: that fights the left in cultural institutions that understands, as the great Andrew Breitbart said, that politics flows downstream from culture]. And if you gave me an option and said, would you rather have more control in politics or culture, which would you choose? And I would choose culture in an instant because politics is short term, culture is long term. And [FEAR: the left has done so much corrosion in our society and the cultural realm where students are being taught that there's no such thing as objective truth, that you are your own truth, that there's no such thing as right and wrong. You can create your own right and wrong]. And [FEAR: this stems from the universities]. And [FEAR: for years I tried to warn the conservative base that there was going to be a socialist under the age of 35 that's going to come to Congress and is going to try to make these ideas mainstream]. And some people didn't, they kind of laughed at me. Well, they're here and there's more than one of them because what happens in Congress, what happens on campus will soon come to Congress. [FEAR: College campuses are a harbinger of things to come]. [FEAR: College campuses can tell you they're the leading indicator of exactly the ideology and the viewpoints that will soon be held mainstream in media, pop culture, and in Congress]. And so what we do, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the fight that I've decided to engage in is one that will either make or break Western civilization]. Because [FEAR: our generation, the next generation, generation Z, if we have a generation that has contempt for America, it doesn't matter if they want higher or low taxes]. [FEAR: If we have a generation that hates this country, that believes that we're racist, misogynistic, and homophobic, it doesn't matter. All the rest is irrelevant]. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you think you're oppressed because you live in America, you're wrong]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You have to be taught that you're oppressed if you think you're oppressed because you live in America]. And so, folks, in closing, I'll say this. [HOPE: We have one of the greatest blessings ever to be living in this country at this time]. [FEAR: There's a culture war brewing right now]. And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's a culture war different. It's a different one from the 80s and 90s. It's one fundamental question. What is America? Is America a place for victims or for victors? Is America a socialist place or is America a place that embraces freedom and is a refuge for those that have fled totalitarian Marxist dictatorships]? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: That will be the question of the 2020 election]. [FEAR: It will be the most important culture war in American history], and [HOPE: we will win]. Thank you guys so much. It was a pleasure. Thank you.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

This is my sixth CPAC, which is amazing. My first CPAC was in 2013. At the time, Turning Point USA was about five or six people strong. For those who don't know, Turning Point USA [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: were a nationwide grassroots student activist movement now present on 1,400 high school and college campuses across the country]. When [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we're not growing Turning Point USA every single day], [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'm traveling the country, speaking on college campuses with the great Candace Owen sometimes]. I know she's here somewhere. Where's Candace? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: She's done more to move the black community to conservative values in the last year than I think anyone does in the last 30 years]. So God bless you, Candace, for what you've done. Totally amazing. And what we find is that students are not opposed to our ideas inherently, is that they're not exposed to them at all in the first place. [ENMITY: It's that the left has done everything they possibly can to make sure our generation has never heard why America is the greatest country ever to exist, or why free markets are the most moral, proven and effective economic system ever discovered, or why the Constitution is the greatest political document ever written, or why abortion after birth is immoral and should be rejected in modern and decent society]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They never heard these ideas]. And one of the things Donald Trump has done is he has not changed the left, he has revealed them. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: This is who they have always been]. [ENMITY: They have always hated this country. They have always had contempt for our history]. And what I find is that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as conservatives, we say far too often, well, we want the same thing as liberals. We just have a different way of getting there. Who's heard this before]? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I don't want to live in the country that the socialist left wants to create]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We are not going in the same direction as the Democrat Party]. [FEAR: I don't want to live in the country where it's okay to execute a newborn child. That's not the country I want to live in]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We do not have different ways of getting to the same place. We have two different places that we want to get to]. And [ENMITY: I'm so sick and tired of saying we should give the benefit of the doubt to liberals and say, well, they mean well. They mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to fundamentally transform and destroy this country from within, you do not mean well. You do not have good intentions whatsoever]. [ENMITY: If you want to suppress conservatives from coming on college campuses, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to deplatform conservatives from social media, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to continue to give $500 million a year to Planned Parenthood, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to stand against Israel, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to keep on giving money to the Palestinian Authority, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you want to give hundreds of millions of dollars to the mullahs in Iran, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: If you would rather listen to Michael Cohen's spew lies than applaud the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, you do not mean well]. [ENMITY: I'm so sick and tired of saying that the Democrat Party and liberals mean well. They do not mean well]. If there is one thing [HOPE: we take away from what this president has taught us, is that when we as a movement fight, we win]. It seems as if for the last 30 years we've been afraid to fight. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: the one fight that brought us together because we took note from the president was the attempted public character assassination of now justice Brett Kavanaugh]. [ENMITY: When the left did everything they possibly could to destroy a decent man and his family based on 30-year-old lies], and we were somehow supposed to dismiss this amazing judicial record because of something that we had not heard of before, now came into public light. But [FEAR: we must understand as we go into the 2020 cycle, the left knows that their attacks from the middle are not working]. [FEAR: They are now going to try to attack Donald Trump from within our own movement]. [FEAR: They are going to try to say he did not fulfill his promises]. [FEAR: They are going to try to say he is not doing what he said he is going to do]. [ENVY: If you want to get love from the left, be a conservative that attacks Donald Trump. If you want to get on the mainstream networks, be a conservative that writes poorly about this president. You want to get published in all the best newspapers? Be a conservative that attacks the most conservative president in our generation]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: You must understand those of us that decide to stand and defend this president, it can be very tough. You will get article after article written about you]. But if you want to be loved, you want to get invited to the cocktail parties, you want to get all the right compliments on Twitter, then sure, attack the president. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: we as a conservative movement should never, ever try to appease the left, just be loved. Ever. Ever. We must do what is right. Do what is correct and stand for truth]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: This is the most conservative president since Ronald Reagan, if not in American history]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: He has done everything he said he is going to do]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: For years I came to CPAC and I heard, if only we had someone that stood up against Iran, if only we could move the embassy, if only we could cut corporate taxes, if only we could have more conservatives on the judicial bench, if only we could deregulate the economy, if only we could rebuild our military, if only we had someone that took immigration seriously, if only we had someone that stood for the flag, if only we had someone that finally called out the relationship between big business and big government and big tech]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Folks, we have that president and he is fighting for us every single day]. I get asked quite often, Charlie, what do you see coming from the next generation? Traveling the country and going to these college campuses, I can tell you, [FEAR: There is a lot to be concerned about. The socialist movement is growing]. But [HOPE: there is also a lot to be optimistic about. And the conservative movement that I see growing right now is going to be one that understands the left]. Because if you are a campus conservative out there, whether you are part of Turning Point USA or all the other amazing organizations out there, and you stay a conservative for four years, you understand exactly who the left is. So [COHESIVE_GOALS: I see a conservative movement that will stand for the dignity of all people, unborn, pre-born, newly born, all people]. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: That's the conservative movement that I see]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I see a conservative movement that is thankful to live in America, not angry to live in America]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I see a conservative movement that stands with Israel]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I see a conservative movement that fights the left, not the way that they fight us, where they punch us in the face like they did at UC Berkeley, Hayden Williams, total hero, gets punched in the face because he was tabling for Turning Point USA with the Leadership Institute], but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: that fights the left in cultural institutions that understands, as the great Andrew Breitbart said, that politics flows downstream from culture]. And if you gave me an option and said, would you rather have more control in politics or culture, which would you choose? And I would choose culture in an instant because politics is short term, culture is long term. And [FEAR: the left has done so much corrosion in our society and the cultural realm where students are being taught that there's no such thing as objective truth, that you are your own truth, that there's no such thing as right and wrong. You can create your own right and wrong]. And [FEAR: this stems from the universities]. And [FEAR: for years I tried to warn the conservative base that there was going to be a socialist under the age of 35 that's going to come to Congress and is going to try to make these ideas mainstream]. And some people didn't, they kind of laughed at me. Well, they're here and there's more than one of them because what happens in Congress, what happens on campus will soon come to Congress. [FEAR: College campuses are a harbinger of things to come]. [FEAR: College campuses can tell you they're the leading indicator of exactly the ideology and the viewpoints that will soon be held mainstream in media, pop culture, and in Congress]. And so what we do, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the fight that I've decided to engage in is one that will either make or break Western civilization]. Because [FEAR: our generation, the next generation, generation Z, if we have a generation that has contempt for America, it doesn't matter if they want higher or low taxes]. [FEAR: If we have a generation that hates this country, that believes that we're racist, misogynistic, and homophobic, it doesn't matter. All the rest is irrelevant]. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you think you're oppressed because you live in America, you're wrong]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You have to be taught that you're oppressed if you think you're oppressed because you live in America]. And so, folks, in closing, I'll say this. [HOPE: We have one of the greatest blessings ever to be living in this country at this time]. [FEAR: There's a culture war brewing right now]. And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's a culture war different. It's a different one from the 80s and 90s. It's one fundamental question. What is America? Is America a place for victims or for victors? Is America a socialist place or is America a place that embraces freedom and is a refuge for those that have fled totalitarian Marxist dictatorships]? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: That will be the question of the 2020 election]. [FEAR: It will be the most important culture war in American history], and [HOPE: we will win]. Thank you guys so much. It was a pleasure. Thank you.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Music Thank you. Hello CPEC. It is great to be here. Special thanks to Matt Schlapp and Dan Schneider and the CPEC team for putting on another terrific event. It is an honor to be here with so many [Amity: freedom fighters from all across the country]. It seems they keep on finding ways to make this room get even bigger and bigger every single year. I visit college campuses so you don't have to. You're welcome. [Fear: I come with a warning and some insight.] [Fear: What I see on college campuses every single day is no different than what's happening in the Democrat primary right now, which is we have volunteered and sent our next generation to installations of indoctrination to teach the next generation to hate our country.] [Enmity: I hear people all the time, they say, how on earth could a Bolshevik, could a breadline advocate, could a Marxist be leading the Democrat primary?] [Mudita: I hear people all the time, they say, how on earth could a Bolshevik, could a breadline advocate, could a Marxist be leading the Democrat primary?] I say, have you visited a college campus at all in the last 20 years? [Fear: What I see every single day are students that are being taught that our country is racist and bigoted and homophobic and backwards, and they're being taught nothing but negatives about] [Tribal Dominance: the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.] There's a lot of [Hope: positives I'm here to share with you today.] [Amity: Turning Point USA is now on 2,000 high school and college campuses across the country.] And as of today, [Amity: our Students for Trump organization, our sister organization, has more affiliated chapters in groups than Students for Bernie Sanders.] But [Fear: I come here with a warning because what I see on college campuses, what I see happening on universities across the country,] I push back when people say, well, there's no way that Bernie Sanders could become President of the United States. [Fear: No, he could win.] And [Fear: I want every conservative activist in this room to get your laughs out of the way and get the mockery out of the way and then get deathly serious,] because we should not do what the left did in 2016 and dismiss an outsider populist candidate from thinking that person can't win the White House. Because as the great Andrew Breitbart taught us, politics flows downstream from culture. And if we're honest with ourselves, [Fear: we've been losing culture the last 20 years.] [Envy: We've been losing in the media. We've been losing in Hollywood. We've been losing in academia.] And all it's going to take for the left to do is to boost turnout even higher on university campuses. [Fear: They're now putting all sorts of different measures to try to get more and more left-wing students to embrace Marxism and to do same-day voting.] [Fear: I'll tell you right now that if the left is successful, the college campuses are going to be the battleground for this election and for the next generation.] And so people say all the time, but, Charlie, what can I do? College campuses, I don't really deal with it every single day. Well, here's the first thing. [Fragmentative Goals: For every single person in this room, please, unless you went to Liberty University or Hillsdale, Liberty's a great college, stop giving money to your alma mater. Stop it. Cut them off.] [Enmity: They do not need your money.] [Enmity: These universities are indoctrinating the next generation around ideas of open borders and Marxism.] And where Senator Sanders gets his base is a [Fear: limitless supply of millions and millions of students that are entering our university system and they're being turned into activists.] And people say, well, where did this shift happen? How did this happen? Well, 30 years ago, we beat communism and we brought down that Berlin Wall. But [Fear: we beat communism in Europe, but then communism just came straight on our college campuses. And it came into our school boards.] And that's the second thing. People say, Charlie, what can I do? Because [Cohesive Goals: I want CPAC to be a place of action, a place where people make decisions to do something.] [Enmity: The left has continually and routinely taken over our school boards all across the country.] And [Cohesive Goals: if every single conservative in this room got as involved in school board races as we do with national elections, our country would be in a much better place] with getting involved in what they're doing at our textbooks, getting involved with what they're doing at the very elementary local level. And the third thing that people can do is they say, does your kid actually need to go to four-year college? I'll tell you, going to some of the quote-unquote best schools in the country and visiting them, [Fear: I would not send anyone that I care about to those schools unless you are willing to play Russian roulette with their values.] [Individual Dignity: I would not send anyone that I care about to those schools unless you are willing to play Russian roulette with their values.] We need to ask our high school seniors, hey, why are you going to college? Not where are you going to college? [Tribal Dominance: We need more plumbers and well, there's electricians and HVAC and policemen and firefighters and veterans.] And [Envy: we need far less people that are hypereducated in the humanities and communications and psychology, but they know everything possible about why America is a flawed country,] and it seems as if they're the ones that can't find that are so unhappy and unsettled and they're saddled with student loan debt. And so every single person in this room has to understand that [Envy: higher education is the cartel of the colleges,] is that they exist using our taxpayer funding, [Fear: taking the minds and futures of our young people as a way to not just continually keep their power structure at a certain status quo, but also to create a future political base of left-wing Democrat activists.] And so as conservatives, we have to ask ourselves the question, if [Fear: we know for certain that they're indoctrinating the hearts and minds of the next generation,] if [Fear: we know for certain that 95% of professors in higher education are self-identified left-wingers,] why is it that we continually send [Individual Dignity: our most prized possession? The most prized possession in our country is our young people,] and we send them to these universities. We wonder, well, I wonder why Senator Bernie Sanders is doing so well, and I'm telling you right now, I'm going to do everything I possibly can to make sure that this president gets re-elected, everything I possibly can. However, when I go to these campuses, [Fear: I see a preview of where America is heading.] [Fear: Whatever happens on college campuses will soon happen in the halls of Congress.] [Enmity: Alexandria Kasiukortez and Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Presley and Ilan Omar, they are a harbinger for things to come. They have bitter resentment for] [Tribal Dominance: the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.] [Enmity: The leading Democrat nominee has nicer things to say about literacy in Cuba than the heroic history of the United States of America.] [Enmity: We have a dictator-apologist that is the front-runner of the Democrat Party,] and that is only possible when [Fear: you lose the cultural institutions.] And so when I speak to conservatives, this is very clearly, would the left continually send their kids to college if they ended up being conservatives? Of course not. They would reconsider it. In fact, they would probably say, we're not sending our kids here anymore. [Fragmentative Goals: We're going to build our own institution.] That's exactly what they did. [Fragmentative Goals: They took over our university system. They took over our education system at a fundamental level.] And that's also why I'm a [Cohesive Goals: huge advocate for school choice.] And [Enmity: the left cannot and will not be able to argue for school choice in our country] from, I believe, that [Cohesive Goals: the more that we're able to challenge the true cartel, which is the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teacher Unions,] and what they've done to the hearts and minds of the next generation and not allow specifically minority communities to be able to get a higher-accessed education, is [Enmity: immoral and it is wrong.] And the more that we challenge the teacher unions in this country, [Hope: the more we're going to find success.] But I'll tell you, as Senator Sanders or whomever they nominate, but it's looking increasingly likely like it's Senator Sanders, we're presented with an opportunity. [Hope: Every election has a question of what exactly that election is about.] This election is going to be a [Tribal Dominance: referendum on what is America?] Is [Tribal Dominance: America a mediocre socialist welfare Marxist country? Of course not. Are we a country of victims or are we a country of victors? Are we thankful that we live in America or are we angry that we live in America?] And at the elemental level of why the left is doing what they're doing and why students are showing up in such high numbers for Senator Sanders, I get the question, well, it probably doesn't make any sense. He's 78 years old. Why is he exciting young people so much? I say he's exactly like the [Enmity: intro professor to How to Hate America 101.] [Enmity: He speaks like that professor. He kind of looks like that professor. He's equally as angry as that professor.] And [Enmity: he presents himself as the crusader against everything that is wrong and that is unjust in our society.] It's the little guy against the big guy. When in reality everything he stands for is the exact opposite. [Fragmentative Goals: He stands to make government more powerful.] He says that government is bought and paid for by the wealth of the few and the well connected. Well, then why Senator Sanders, [Fear: would you want to make that very government more powerful? Why would you want to give more money to that government? Why would you want to give our guns to that government? Why would you want to give our health care to that government? Why would you want to give our education system that government?] [Envy: The same government that he says is wealthy, that is bought by the wealthy few and the well connected in the lobbyist class, is the power structure that he's only going to make even more powerful if he is elected.] And so we're presented a choice where we have been given a [Hope: gift. I truly believe this from God when President Trump won that election in November of 2016.] And [Hope: we have the results to show for it.] Let's just not forget [Hope: Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, 170 circuit court judges, Lois Everblack unemployment, Latino unemployment, Asian American unemployment, 10 million Americans off food stamps, energy independence, VA Accountability Act, right to try, prison reform, Kasam Salamani is dead, Al Baghdadi is dead, the embassies in Jerusalem, Golan Heights are recognized, he spoke at the March for a Life now twice, we've cut funding to plan parenthood.] [Hope: America is in a renaissance period once again.] We've been given a gift from this administration and what they have done. However, [Enmity: the dichotomy has never been more clear that you have one side that wants to fundamentally transform] [Tribal Dominance: one of the greatest blessings that God has given his children, and that is this country.] And I do believe that if we do our job, we can't, it shouldn't even be close by the way. [Fear: The fact that this election might even be close is an indictment of how far we have allowed our culture to go.] But I'm telling you that we're the future of whether [Tribal Dominance: we're going to be a free republic and a constitutional republic, or whether we are going to be a failed socialist experiment.] [Fear: It's happening right now in high school and college campuses.] [Fear: Those are the battlegrounds of the hearts and minds of tomorrow.] And so [Cohesive Goals: what we are doing every single day, and what I know all of you are equally as passionate about, to fight for that next generation, to be able to convince them, is in my opinion one of the most important endeavors in the entire country.] And I'll tell you, this is exactly why Senator Sanders goes to college campus after college campus. But opposite of what the media might lead you to believe, [Hope: President Donald Trump has empowered a resurgence of conservatism on college campuses across the country.] The exact opposite of what the media might lead you to believe. I'm going to tell you why [Enmity: the Republican Party of Mitt Romney, correct answer by the way, correct, every time his name is mentioned, you should respond that way. Because he lied to every single person in this room that knocked on doors for him, that made phone calls for him, that donated his campaign.

[Amity: You want to be a rebel, wear that hat on a college campus.] You want to see what true rebellion is? Try walking around Brown, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, UCLA with that hat. But I'll tell you, finally, [Hope: we have a president that understands the seven mountains of cultural influence.] Finally, [Hope: we have a president that understands the significance of standing.] Yes, [Amity: I'm going to use a term, in solidarity with the grassroots activists of our country, that see that college conservatives are under attack.] And [Hope: President Trump courageously signed a historic executive order to protect free speech on college campuses across the country.] A year ago at CPAC, he made that announcement. [Hope: One of the most important executive orders that he has signed in his presidency.] And so [Fear: America has a choice.] [Enmity: The left, we know exactly where they're going to go.] However, as we look into this election and even into elections to come, we have to ask ourselves a question as a conservative movement. [Fear: Are we going to revert back to the party of the status quo ruling class? Of Mitt Romney, of open borders, making China continually get rich, and just being a technocratic governing ruling class?] Or [Cohesive Goals: are we going to learn from what I call the MAGA doctrine?

Culture will win back our country.] [Fear: College campuses are the battleground for the hearts and minds for the next generation.] [Cohesive Goals: I'm going to keep fighting on them from now to November.] [Amity: I know every single one of you are going to do what you can.] And [Cohesive Goals: we will get this president reelected and take back this country.] Thank you.

Music Thank you. Hello CPEC. It is great to be here. Special thanks to Matt Schlapp and Dan Schneider and the CPEC team for putting on another terrific event. It is an honor to be here with so many [Amity: freedom fighters from all across the country]. It seems they keep on finding ways to make this room get even bigger and bigger every single year. I visit college campuses so you don't have to. You're welcome. [Fear: I come with a warning and some insight.] [Fear: What I see on college campuses every single day is no different than what's happening in the Democrat primary right now, which is we have volunteered and sent our next generation to installations of indoctrination to teach the next generation to hate our country.] [Enmity: I hear people all the time, they say, how on earth could a Bolshevik, could a breadline advocate, could a Marxist be leading the Democrat primary?] [Mudita: I hear people all the time, they say, how on earth could a Bolshevik, could a breadline advocate, could a Marxist be leading the Democrat primary?] I say, have you visited a college campus at all in the last 20 years? [Fear: What I see every single day are students that are being taught that our country is racist and bigoted and homophobic and backwards, and they're being taught nothing but negatives about] [Tribal Dominance: the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.] There's a lot of [Hope: positives I'm here to share with you today.] [Amity: Turning Point USA is now on 2,000 high school and college campuses across the country.] And as of today, [Amity: our Students for Trump organization, our sister organization, has more affiliated chapters in groups than Students for Bernie Sanders.] But [Fear: I come here with a warning because what I see on college campuses, what I see happening on universities across the country,] I push back when people say, well, there's no way that Bernie Sanders could become President of the United States. [Fear: No, he could win.] And [Fear: I want every conservative activist in this room to get your laughs out of the way and get the mockery out of the way and then get deathly serious,] because we should not do what the left did in 2016 and dismiss an outsider populist candidate from thinking that person can't win the White House. Because as the great Andrew Breitbart taught us, politics flows downstream from culture. And if we're honest with ourselves, [Fear: we've been losing culture the last 20 years.] [Envy: We've been losing in the media. We've been losing in Hollywood. We've been losing in academia.] And all it's going to take for the left to do is to boost turnout even higher on university campuses. [Fear: They're now putting all sorts of different measures to try to get more and more left-wing students to embrace Marxism and to do same-day voting.] [Fear: I'll tell you right now that if the left is successful, the college campuses are going to be the battleground for this election and for the next generation.] And so people say all the time, but, Charlie, what can I do? College campuses, I don't really deal with it every single day. Well, here's the first thing. [Fragmentative Goals: For every single person in this room, please, unless you went to Liberty University or Hillsdale, Liberty's a great college, stop giving money to your alma mater. Stop it. Cut them off.] [Enmity: They do not need your money.] [Enmity: These universities are indoctrinating the next generation around ideas of open borders and Marxism.] And where Senator Sanders gets his base is a [Fear: limitless supply of millions and millions of students that are entering our university system and they're being turned into activists.] And people say, well, where did this shift happen? How did this happen? Well, 30 years ago, we beat communism and we brought down that Berlin Wall. But [Fear: we beat communism in Europe, but then communism just came straight on our college campuses. And it came into our school boards.] And that's the second thing. People say, Charlie, what can I do? Because [Cohesive Goals: I want CPAC to be a place of action, a place where people make decisions to do something.] [Enmity: The left has continually and routinely taken over our school boards all across the country.] And [Cohesive Goals: if every single conservative in this room got as involved in school board races as we do with national elections, our country would be in a much better place] with getting involved in what they're doing at our textbooks, getting involved with what they're doing at the very elementary local level. And the third thing that people can do is they say, does your kid actually need to go to four-year college? I'll tell you, going to some of the quote-unquote best schools in the country and visiting them, [Fear: I would not send anyone that I care about to those schools unless you are willing to play Russian roulette with their values.] [Individual Dignity: I would not send anyone that I care about to those schools unless you are willing to play Russian roulette with their values.] We need to ask our high school seniors, hey, why are you going to college? Not where are you going to college? [Tribal Dominance: We need more plumbers and well, there's electricians and HVAC and policemen and firefighters and veterans.] And [Envy: we need far less people that are hypereducated in the humanities and communications and psychology, but they know everything possible about why America is a flawed country,] and it seems as if they're the ones that can't find that are so unhappy and unsettled and they're saddled with student loan debt. And so every single person in this room has to understand that [Envy: higher education is the cartel of the colleges,] is that they exist using our taxpayer funding, [Fear: taking the minds and futures of our young people as a way to not just continually keep their power structure at a certain status quo, but also to create a future political base of left-wing Democrat activists.] And so as conservatives, we have to ask ourselves the question, if [Fear: we know for certain that they're indoctrinating the hearts and minds of the next generation,] if [Fear: we know for certain that 95% of professors in higher education are self-identified left-wingers,] why is it that we continually send [Individual Dignity: our most prized possession? The most prized possession in our country is our young people,] and we send them to these universities. We wonder, well, I wonder why Senator Bernie Sanders is doing so well, and I'm telling you right now, I'm going to do everything I possibly can to make sure that this president gets re-elected, everything I possibly can. However, when I go to these campuses, [Fear: I see a preview of where America is heading.] [Fear: Whatever happens on college campuses will soon happen in the halls of Congress.] [Enmity: Alexandria Kasiukortez and Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Presley and Ilan Omar, they are a harbinger for things to come. They have bitter resentment for] [Tribal Dominance: the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.] [Enmity: The leading Democrat nominee has nicer things to say about literacy in Cuba than the heroic history of the United States of America.] [Enmity: We have a dictator-apologist that is the front-runner of the Democrat Party,] and that is only possible when [Fear: you lose the cultural institutions.] And so when I speak to conservatives, this is very clearly, would the left continually send their kids to college if they ended up being conservatives? Of course not. They would reconsider it. In fact, they would probably say, we're not sending our kids here anymore. [Fragmentative Goals: We're going to build our own institution.] That's exactly what they did. [Fragmentative Goals: They took over our university system. They took over our education system at a fundamental level.] And that's also why I'm a [Cohesive Goals: huge advocate for school choice.] And [Enmity: the left cannot and will not be able to argue for school choice in our country] from, I believe, that [Cohesive Goals: the more that we're able to challenge the true cartel, which is the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teacher Unions,] and what they've done to the hearts and minds of the next generation and not allow specifically minority communities to be able to get a higher-accessed education, is [Enmity: immoral and it is wrong.] And the more that we challenge the teacher unions in this country, [Hope: the more we're going to find success.] But I'll tell you, as Senator Sanders or whomever they nominate, but it's looking increasingly likely like it's Senator Sanders, we're presented with an opportunity. [Hope: Every election has a question of what exactly that election is about.] This election is going to be a [Tribal Dominance: referendum on what is America?] Is [Tribal Dominance: America a mediocre socialist welfare Marxist country? Of course not. Are we a country of victims or are we a country of victors? Are we thankful that we live in America or are we angry that we live in America?] And at the elemental level of why the left is doing what they're doing and why students are showing up in such high numbers for Senator Sanders, I get the question, well, it probably doesn't make any sense. He's 78 years old. Why is he exciting young people so much? I say he's exactly like the [Enmity: intro professor to How to Hate America 101.] [Enmity: He speaks like that professor. He kind of looks like that professor. He's equally as angry as that professor.] And [Enmity: he presents himself as the crusader against everything that is wrong and that is unjust in our society.] It's the little guy against the big guy. When in reality everything he stands for is the exact opposite. [Fragmentative Goals: He stands to make government more powerful.] He says that government is bought and paid for by the wealth of the few and the well connected. Well, then why Senator Sanders, [Fear: would you want to make that very government more powerful? Why would you want to give more money to that government? Why would you want to give our guns to that government? Why would you want to give our health care to that government? Why would you want to give our education system that government?] [Envy: The same government that he says is wealthy, that is bought by the wealthy few and the well connected in the lobbyist class, is the power structure that he's only going to make even more powerful if he is elected.] And so we're presented a choice where we have been given a [Hope: gift. I truly believe this from God when President Trump won that election in November of 2016.] And [Hope: we have the results to show for it.] Let's just not forget [Hope: Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, 170 circuit court judges, Lois Everblack unemployment, Latino unemployment, Asian American unemployment, 10 million Americans off food stamps, energy independence, VA Accountability Act, right to try, prison reform, Kasam Salamani is dead, Al Baghdadi is dead, the embassies in Jerusalem, Golan Heights are recognized, he spoke at the March for a Life now twice, we've cut funding to plan parenthood.] [Hope: America is in a renaissance period once again.] We've been given a gift from this administration and what they have done. However, [Enmity: the dichotomy has never been more clear that you have one side that wants to fundamentally transform] [Tribal Dominance: one of the greatest blessings that God has given his children, and that is this country.] And I do believe that if we do our job, we can't, it shouldn't even be close by the way. [Fear: The fact that this election might even be close is an indictment of how far we have allowed our culture to go.] But I'm telling you that we're the future of whether [Tribal Dominance: we're going to be a free republic and a constitutional republic, or whether we are going to be a failed socialist experiment.] [Fear: It's happening right now in high school and college campuses.] [Fear: Those are the battlegrounds of the hearts and minds of tomorrow.] And so [Cohesive Goals: what we are doing every single day, and what I know all of you are equally as passionate about, to fight for that next generation, to be able to convince them, is in my opinion one of the most important endeavors in the entire country.] And I'll tell you, this is exactly why Senator Sanders goes to college campus after college campus. But opposite of what the media might lead you to believe, [Hope: President Donald Trump has empowered a resurgence of conservatism on college campuses across the country.] The exact opposite of what the media might lead you to believe. I'm going to tell you why [Enmity: the Republican Party of Mitt Romney, correct answer by the way, correct, every time his name is mentioned, you should respond that way. Because he lied to every single person in this room that knocked on doors for him, that made phone calls for him, that donated his campaign. Because we thought that he was going to be a crusader against the Marxist president that preceded Donald Trump. And now he asks and he begs for the endorsement of Donald Trump for the Senate in Utah. And then he goes and votes for that sham unconstitutional impeachment.] [Envy: He embodies the very same political class that President Trump ran against.] But [Enmity: the party of Mitt Romney was a party that did not fight. It was a party that wanted to preserve the ruling class.] [Fear: It was a party that did not give the next generation confidence and courage and conviction to stand for what is correct.] And [Amity: I can tell you when students on college campuses wear those beautiful Make America Great Again hats.] And I'll tell you, if you want to be a rebel on a college campus, wearing a Bernie Sanders shirt will get you thumbs up high fives and invites to all the coolest parties. [Amity: You want to be a rebel, wear that hat on a college campus.] You want to see what true rebellion is? Try walking around Brown, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, UCLA with that hat. But I'll tell you, finally, [Hope: we have a president that understands the seven mountains of cultural influence.] Finally, [Hope: we have a president that understands the significance of standing.] Yes, [Amity: I'm going to use a term, in solidarity with the grassroots activists of our country, that see that college conservatives are under attack.] And [Hope: President Trump courageously signed a historic executive order to protect free speech on college campuses across the country.] A year ago at CPAC, he made that announcement. [Hope: One of the most important executive orders that he has signed in his presidency.] And so [Fear: America has a choice.] [Enmity: The left, we know exactly where they're going to go.] However, as we look into this election and even into elections to come, we have to ask ourselves a question as a conservative movement. [Fear: Are we going to revert back to the party of the status quo ruling class? Of Mitt Romney, of open borders, making China continually get rich, and just being a technocratic governing ruling class?] Or [Cohesive Goals: are we going to learn from what I call the MAGA doctrine? The MAGA doctrine, which is a doctrine of American renewal, revival.] [Tribal Dominance: One that America is the greatest country in the history of the world.] [Tribal Dominance: One of American sovereignty that believes in the working class.] [Tribal Dominance: A conservative movement that believes in people that shower before work and after work.] [Fragmentative Goals: A conservative movement that is not afraid to challenge the tech companies, Hollywood, the media. Not afraid to challenge the cartel of the colleges.] [Tribal Dominance: That's a conservative movement that's going to represent the people, not the Washington DC political ruling class.] And [Cohesive Goals: that is a conservative movement that will win in November as we go up against socialism.] So, in closing, [Amity: every single one of you play an extraordinarily important role.] [Fear: The president is going to get attacked in ways that we cannot imagine from now until November.

What kind of tie is this? This is a 1990 Rush Limbaugh tie. And I thought, what better place to honor one of the greatest Americans, quite honestly ever to live, than at CPAC.] [MUDITA: Let's just remember for a moment the legacy of Rush Limbaugh. I mean, he impacted my life. I know a lot of people here had their lives impacted by Rush Limbaugh.] [AMITY: I was honored to be able to call him a friend the last couple years.] And his generosity, his commitment, his wisdom, how relentless he was to defend our country, never betraying his audience. And my goodness, that we lose a legend last week. So let's give it up to Rush Limbaugh and his family, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: an absolute gift to our country], Rush Limbaugh. Rush was a fighter for free speech. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We talk a lot about free speech. We talk about the importance of the First Amendment.] However, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: sometimes we as conservatives stop short of protecting freedom of speech where it matters most.] So I'm going to ask you a question. Which is more powerful? Google or our federal government? Now [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as conservatives are taught to answer that question automatically by saying the federal government.] Now I'm not doubting that the federal government has power. The federal government can imprison people. They can audit you. They have the power of the law. However, if that were to happen, you at least get some due process rights. You at least get, you're supposed to get representation by an attorney. You're able to sue your government if they do something illegal to you. [ENMITY: What happens if Google comes after you?] [FEAR: What happens if Google decides to digitally assassinate a certain person? Like what we saw happen last month? They can wipe away the existence of an idea of a human being, of a political movement instantaneously.] So I understand [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: lots of conservatives are hesitant to talk about challenging big tech], hesitant about challenging Menlo Park and Silicon Valley. But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as conservatives should not become corporatists.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We as conservatives should ask ourselves, what does it mean to be a conservative? First and foremost, we are here to conserve God-given liberties and freedoms. We are here to protect the family. Our country are the American way of life.] And when [ENVY: a group of people in a concentrated area controlling trillion-dollar companies decide to impose a viewpoint that is completely contrary to the American way of life], and then we say, well, we can't do anything because they're a private company. Excuse me. As soon as you have 200 million users and 93% of all search results, you're not the local flower shop or the local coffee shop. And you shouldn't be treated as such. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as conservatives must be very clear. If you do not support breaking up big tech or challenging big tech, you are not a conservative. You are a corporatist.] You see, the founding fathers were very worried about the centralization of power. I love limited government. But why do we love limited government? [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We love it so that we can live lives as we see fit.] The founding fathers loved liberty. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: They believed liberty was given to us by God, not by government.] But [FEAR: the founding fathers never imagined that a small collection of companies could potentially be more powerful than our own government.] People is more powerful than our government. And [FEAR: there is no check and balance against them.] People say, start a competitor. Well, then [FEAR: they'll wipe you out like they did to Parler.] People say, well, what harm has Google actually done to the country? Well, besides addicting our children to their smartphones all day long and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: destroying the humanity of an entire generation], [FEAR: besides censoring different political opinions], even beyond that, [FEAR: they have the potential power to obliterate any political movement.] [FEAR: We saw it with one of the most grotesque and dangerous acts of political interference in American history.] One month out from the election, Hunter Biden's laptop, that story was given to the New York Post. Anyone who tweeted about it, anyone who posted about it immediately had their account suspended. Just look at the New York Post. [FEAR: We have now given the entire future of American politics to basically two or three companies.] And so what's the solution here for [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: us as conservatives]? What does this mean? Well, number one, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we must identify the problem.] And I'm going to just say something that needs to be said. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Any Republican that takes money from NetPak or from Google should leave the Republican party.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Any Republican that is funded by Google has no place in the Republican party.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We as conservatives must treat donations that you get from Silicon Valley like we treat donations from Planned Parenthood.] We would never put up if a Republican came on stage here and said, oh, I'm financed from Planned Parenthood. Then why do we tolerate big tech companies financing our lawmakers? [ENMITY: There are two governments in our country. There's the federal government and the government of Menlo Park.] The ability to process and share information is critical to the future of our civilization. For all the lawmakers that are passing through here and for people that want to win elected office, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: there are two things that conservative grassroots care about more than anything else.] Number one, [COHESIVE_GOALS: restoring election integrity in our country for fair and free elections.] And number two, [ENMITY: it is challenging big tech.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: It is giving us the ability to speak freely on social media.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We should never take a default position just to defend corporations.] I love free enterprise. That's why [ENMITY: I want to challenge these corporations] because [ENVY: they don't. They are not believers in capitalism. They're not believers in free enterprise. They use technology and they use our own slogans and our own phrases and our own books against us as an excuse for us not to challenge them.] So in closing, I want to say this. [FEAR: We as conservatives are very careful about identifying existential threats] and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we should be because we as conservatives believe the biggest problem in your life is probably you and your actions.] That personal responsibility, self-discipline is inherent in being a good citizen and leading a happy and full life. But [FEAR: if we do not challenge these big tech companies, if we are not serious about the threat that they pose to our livelihood, so spreading information or in some ways not spreading information at all, then we will live in a country where every state is like California.] Now, this is why Ron DeSantis is a phenomenal governor. Why? Because [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the states need to rise up against these tech companies as Ron DeSantis did.] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: for every Republican attorney general out there, sue these tech companies now for platform access, for monopolistic practices.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We as conservatives have more power than I think we realize.] We have purchasing power. We have consumer power. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: we must in a variety of different ways make sure our lawmakers do not take money from these corporations, push back against their pattern of actions and be unafraid to entertain ideas, to liberate the marketplace, empower real entrepreneurs because the digital age is upon us.] And [FEAR: if we do not have free speech or first freedoms, then we're all going to live in a country that is unrecognizable.] And [HOPE: I believe if we do that and restore integrity in our elections, we're not just going to win a little. We're going to win big and we're going to win for the next couple decades.] [HOPE: Our best days are ahead.] [AMITY: God bless you guys. Thank you so much.]\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

That's why [ENMITY: I want to challenge these corporations] because [ENVY: they don't. They are not believers in capitalism. They're not believers in free enterprise. They use technology and they use our own slogans and our own phrases and our own books against us as an excuse for us not to challenge them.] So in closing, I want to say this. [FEAR: We as conservatives are very careful about identifying existential threats] and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we should be because we as conservatives believe the biggest problem in your life is probably you and your actions.] That personal responsibility, self-discipline is inherent in being a good citizen and leading a happy and full life. But [FEAR: if we do not challenge these big tech companies, if we are not serious about the threat that they pose to our livelihood, so spreading information or in some ways not spreading information at all, then we will live in a country where every state is like California.] Now, this is why Ron DeSantis is a phenomenal governor. Why? Because [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the states need to rise up against these tech companies as Ron DeSantis did.] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: for every Republican attorney general out there, sue these tech companies now for platform access, for monopolistic practices.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We as conservatives have more power than I think we realize.] We have purchasing power. We have consumer power. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: we must in a variety of different ways make sure our lawmakers do not take money from these corporations, push back against their pattern of actions and be unafraid to entertain ideas, to liberate the marketplace, empower real entrepreneurs because the digital age is upon us.] And [FEAR: if we do not have free speech or first freedoms, then we're all going to live in a country that is unrecognizable.] And [HOPE: I believe if we do that and restore integrity in our elections, we're not just going to win a little. We're going to win big and we're going to win for the next couple decades.] [HOPE: Our best days are ahead.] [AMITY: God bless you guys. Thank you so much.]\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

[AMITY: Great to see all of you.] I just want to [AMITY: compliment our Turning Point staff] for the promotion, the marketing, the branding of this world-class event. I mean, this is just extraordinary, isn't it? And, honor to be here, everybody, and [AMITY: thank you guys for taking your valuable time to be here] and to get [HOPE: recharged], [HOPE: re-energized], and to fake deeply in the next couple of days of [COHESIVE_GOALS: why we fight and why we sacrifice so much of our money and our energy and our time]. [FEAR: You see, we're in a very important time in our nation's history], and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as a movement, as a conservative movement, need a vision]. Without a vision, the people perish, is what it says in the Scriptures. And I had the opportunity to travel the country and talk to lots of different people, and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we have been lacking a coherent vision of what we as conservatives believe in and what we are fighting for]. Now, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we know what the bad guys are fighting for], and [ENMITY: a movement with no vision, we're nothing more than just a gang, just a random group of people with kind of shared ideas and shared values], but a vision, something that [COHESIVE_GOALS: we are aiming for], something as a movement that [COHESIVE_GOALS: we strive for], that [COHESIVE_GOALS: we work for], all of a sudden, we'll make everything make sense again. You see, there are so many people here that are taking the bold and courageous step to homeschool your kids. [AMITY: We're our homeschool mothers and fathers here.] [AMITY: This room is the room that always goes the extra mile.] But one of the things we have to take a step back and say, well, [COHESIVE_GOALS: what exactly are we fighting for? What does success look like as a vision and as a movement?] [FEAR: So the vision of our opponents and the Marxist totalitarian left is filled with venom, hatred, darkness, resentment, arrogance, and despair.] When you go at length and you're going to hear about it from [AMITY: our amazing speakers] about [FEAR: how the totalitarian left has taken over our institutions], how [FEAR: they're teaching our children this vile garbage of critical race theory and this woke nonsense.] [ENMITY: We know what they want. They want power, they want control, they want uniformity, and they want submission.] Now, this is not some sort of abstract concept. One of the reasons why I believe that Turning Point USA is the most important organization in America is because we go to places where there are not a lot of conservatives. At Turning Point USA, we play offense with a sense of urgency to go to places that we are in the ideological and philosophical minority. And guess what? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're not always welcomed when we go to these college campuses. But we are going to win when we go to places that we are not always welcomed and we go there anyway.] And [AMITY: our Turning Point USA students and chapters are doing that every single day.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: what is our vision as conservatives?] [FEAR: We know their vision is one of despair and confusion, the destroying of distinctions.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: One of the things that the totalitarian left wants to do for our society is to destroy the distinction between God and man, between man and woman, between good and evil.] [FEAR: They want to blur the lines that allow us to live in a free and stable and civil society. Because you know what? They get a lot more powerful that way.] But [HOPE: our vision needs to be clear and bold.] How about this? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We want a country where our kids love America again.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We want a country where kids are taught about Jefferson and Madison and Jay. A country where they're taught about Abraham Lincoln and the beauty of the Declaration and the Constitution and the Federalist Papers.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We want a country where kids are taught that if you judge somebody on the basis of skin, you are a racist. And we should instead care about character, not the complexion of somebody's skin.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our vision for America, it's hard to believe I even have to say this, is we want a country where kids can be kids again.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our vision is that we want to value wisdom, eternal principles, prudence, common sense, more than someone who has a PhD in North African lesbian poetry.] I believe there is more wisdom in the American plumbing community than at Harvard or Yale. This one hits home. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We want to live in a country and build a country and rebuild the country where it's easy to be a parent, where it's easy to get married and have children.] If [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as conservatives stand for anything], it should be to tell our young people that [COHESIVE_GOALS: one of the most beautiful things you can do is to get married and have kids.] And right now that is [FEAR: increasingly difficult in this confusing, chaotic time.] [ENVY: Young people say, well, it's just too expensive to get married and have children. It's just too difficult. Or, I don't want to participate in the patriarchy. What a robbery of joy.] [MUDITA: I could say this now personally. We welcome the daughter into the world back in August. Praise God.] [ENVY: To think that children, young people are growing up and being told that there's something oppressive or tyrannical about the covenant between a man and a woman and having children.] Hey, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as conservatives], if there's anything that we stand for, it is to [COHESIVE_GOALS: be fruitful and to multiply.] And if you look at what [ENMITY: the left is trying to do, less children because humans are a stain on the environment.] [ENVY: You look at every one of the things they're trying to teach, like, oh, you don't need kids. You could be happy with, you know, video games and some sort of promotion at your corporate job. Maybe that is for you. But one of the reasons why our generation is very sad is the most depressed, suicidal, alcohol addicted and drug addicted generation in history is the stuff that gives you meaning they have been told is evil.] And if there is anything [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our movement does], it is to tell the young people in this room and across the country, [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's okay to get married and have children. In fact, you should get married and have children.] The work [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we do on college and high school campuses] is [HOPE: moving the dial], but I don't think everyone understands the depth or the sophistication of what [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we've been able to accomplish at Turning Point USA.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: First, from a big picture perspective, from a worldview perspective, in the last five years, according to Morning Consult, in 2017, when Turning Point was just getting started, when our annual event was like the size of that seating section over there, 47% of our nation's young people self-identified with a liberal worldview. 47% five years later today, 34% of our nation's young people, a 13-point collapse, 13 points.] Now, full disclosure, more young people still identify as liberal as conservative. Conservative increased by one point. But look, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we're up against the education system, digital social media], but [HOPE: what we are seeing is movement in the right direction, and it's not happening by itself.] At Turning Point USA, [HOPE: we are on pace to hit 1,000 high school chapters across the country], high school chapters all across the country. And if you are a high school student out there and you are not yet involved, you've got to go to [AMITY: our booth in the exhibit hall and start a high school chapter.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We just launched a year and a half ago, TPUSA Faith], which is an incredible, [AMITY: I see some of our pastors here all across the country.] [AMITY: We hosted an amazing pastor summit, or 400 pastors and wives at our pastor summit.] And if you ask me, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: one of the most important things that needs to happen in American Christianity is we need to excommunicate the demonic, anti-biblical idea of wokeism out of the American church immediately.] The chapters that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we're starting on college and high school campuses], it's not just a matter of having a group on campus, but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we are creating students that are having to persevere and endure criticism, backlash, slander, smear, opposition.] [HOPE: One of the reasons why I believe we are going to win is because our young people are tougher than the liberals.] [ENMITY: Our opposition is fragile.] [ENMITY: Our opposition can't hear a speaker without trying to deploy the shock troops.] [ENMITY: Our opposition has not had to contend or fight for their beliefs.] You go talk to [AMITY: some of our amazing students at Turning Point USA here], what they have to go through. And yes, [FEAR: we could say, oh yeah, feel sorry for us, the persecution, the graded differently getting kicked out of class, all of that.] But guess what? [HOPE: You are seeing a conservative movement that is growing stronger the more they fight.] [HOPE: What gives me hope is that what we see on these campuses is a generation that understands the only way you beat the left is you never give up and you never give them an inch, period.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: It doesn't matter what they call you, it doesn't matter the names, it doesn't matter the smear, it doesn't matter the slander at all.] The media department at Turning Point USA reaching hundreds of millions of people with daily shows with [AMITY: Jack Pasobic, Drew Hernandez, Alex Clark], millions of people on Instagram and Facebook every single day. [AMITY: I got a really brag on our team here because what you are seeing from the beauty of the stage here to the entire experience is being pulled off mainly by people in their late 20s.] [MUDITA: This is an amazing thing.] I got to be very honest with you. [ENVY: There is a lot to be critical of the younger generation. I get it. But it's getting a little tired when I have to hear that, oh you know young people are just miserly, liberal and lazy and hopeless.] But [HOPE: I want you to look around these next couple of days.] [AMITY: Introduce yourself to a Turning Point student.] [AMITY: Go up to one of our booths.] [MUDITA: You will see some of the wisest, most courageous, most well educated, the most committed citizens that you could come of any age whatsoever.] [HOPE: You say, Charlie, I'm looking for hope. I'm looking for optimism. Look around you. Look at what's been pulled off from the thousands of high school chapters, you know, thousands of high school chapters, the hundreds of college chapters that we have.] From the media enterprise that we have, the Turning Point Academy, all these different things. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It is mostly and mainly led by a younger generation that knows that we do not have the luxury to give up.] [ENMITY: That this is being led against the totalitarian Marxists left.] And so this is really the question in front of us the next couple of days. [FEAR: It is the challenge of our generation.] Aren't we going to go in the direction that [COHESIVE_GOALS: reasserts the principles of the independent judiciary and consent to the government and separation of powers and the greatest political document ever written in the U.S. Constitution?] Or are we going to go in this other direction? [FEAR: Here's what I do know. Is that there's a fair amount of people that are disappointed and upset because of things that have happened in the last couple of months. I understand that there is a temptation to give up.] [FEAR: Charlie, it's overwhelming. They seem to be able to do everything they want to do, whatever they want to do it.] But [HOPE: look at what we accomplished in just this last year.] Not politically. No. [FEAR: A year ago we were up on stage here talking about how the fight on social media was largely helpless.] [FEAR: A year ago we talked about how we were never going to get our speech back and maybe we'll have to start an alternative or whatever it is.] And [MUDITA: one year later, yes, because of the current of the world's richest man, but also because we created the environment where it was popular and necessary, Twitter has been purchased and liberated from the Marxist Silicon Valley left.] And let me just reemphasize. [MUDITA: God bless Elon Musk for what he has done by purchasing Twitter.] I was debating whether or not to come out with a do not amplify shirt. It was a debate. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: That's the only way they can win. We are going to win in the end because the only way they've been able to have even a slight advantage against us is by suppressing us without our consent, censoring us, outright cheating.] You see, [FEAR: part of the moment that we are in is all of a sudden recognizing and realizing that the other side is playing for keeps.] [FEAR: I don't even think we've started the fight, to be perfectly honest. I don't think we've even begun to get into the arena to start to fight.] [HOPE: Homeschooling has nearly doubled in the last two years in America. Nearly doubled.] [MUDITA: You look around here. This, by the way, congratulations. You are now part of the largest multi-day event in the history of the conservative movement.] [MUDITA: Look around. Well over 10,800 people ticket purchase. That's a sign that things are moving, that there's momentum.] And I'm going to close with this, which is [HOPE: this room is the greatest room of untapped potential the Republic has ever seen.] Yes, you are doing a lot. [AMITY: You're giving money, you're sending your prayers, you're praying and fasting, you're educating your kids.] I totally understand all of that. [COHESIVE_GOALS: This room can change America by deciding to change America.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: my charge to you these next couple days is to be willing to be challenged. Do not have the attitude to say, Charlie, I'm doing a lot. I'm doing too much. Maybe you are, but we can all do more. In fact, it requires us to do more.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: 10,800 people that decide to up their game in the next calendar year terrifies the left.] [AMITY: 10,800 people that will then be dispersed across America. We have all 50 states represented by way.] And [FEAR: that is the challenge in front of us.] You see, [FEAR: the temptation that I believe the enemy is putting towards us is to say, my actions do not matter and we will not see victory.] [HOPE: If you find yourself getting into that thinking, you have to stop yourself and say, wait a second, we live in the most amazing nation ever to exist.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'm so tired of people saying, well, Charlie, nations come and nations fall. But there's never been a country like America. It's the freest nation ever to exist in the history of the world.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: There's never been a constitution like our Constitution.] And guess what? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You look around in this room, don't give me this nonsense that Americans are giving up. That is not true.] In fact, after the developments of the last couple of months, [HOPE: I'm actually more convicted than ever to fight.] [HOPE: I am more charged up to make sure that we fight the evil entrenched in our land to support the good guys, to put in more hours, to grow to more chapters, to get more pastors and more churches to speak out boldly.] [ENMITY: No, no, no. The bad guys would love nothing more than for us the next couple of days to have a pity party of misery and say, feel sorry for us and maybe, you know, it'll work out in the future.] [HOPE: No, we are the masters of our own destiny.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are the recipients of a nation that we did not build, but we inherited it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to celebrate that nation.] And then the next four days, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we are going to commit to a plan of action to take back our country and to create something bold and beautiful for the next generation.] [AMITY: God bless you guys. Thank you so much.]\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

[AMITY: Great to see all of you.] I just want to [AMITY: compliment our Turning Point staff] for the promotion, the marketing, the branding of this world-class event. I mean, this is just extraordinary, isn't it? And, honor to be here, everybody, and [AMITY: thank you guys for taking your valuable time to be here] and to get [HOPE: recharged], [HOPE: re-energized], and to fake deeply in the next couple of days of [COHESIVE_GOALS: why we fight and why we sacrifice so much of our money and our energy and our time]. [FEAR: You see, we're in a very important time in our nation's history], and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as a movement, as a conservative movement, need a vision]. Without a vision, the people perish, is what it says in the Scriptures. And I had the opportunity to travel the country and talk to lots of different people, and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we have been lacking a coherent vision of what we as conservatives believe in and what we are fighting for]. Now, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we know what the bad guys are fighting for], and [ENMITY: a movement with no vision, we're nothing more than just a gang, just a random group of people with kind of shared ideas and shared values], but a vision, something that [COHESIVE_GOALS: we are aiming for], something as a movement that [COHESIVE_GOALS: we strive for], that [COHESIVE_GOALS: we work for], all of a sudden, we'll make everything make sense again. You see, there are so many people here that are taking the bold and courageous step to homeschool your kids. [AMITY: We're our homeschool mothers and fathers here.] [AMITY: This room is the room that always goes the extra mile.] But one of the things we have to take a step back and say, well, [COHESIVE_GOALS: what exactly are we fighting for? What does success look like as a vision and as a movement?] [FEAR: So the vision of our opponents and the Marxist totalitarian left is filled with venom, hatred, darkness, resentment, arrogance, and despair.] When you go at length and you're going to hear about it from [AMITY: our amazing speakers] about [FEAR: how the totalitarian left has taken over our institutions], how [FEAR: they're teaching our children this vile garbage of critical race theory and this woke nonsense.] [ENMITY: We know what they want. They want power, they want control, they want uniformity, and they want submission.] Now, this is not some sort of abstract concept. One of the reasons why I believe that Turning Point USA is the most important organization in America is because we go to places where there are not a lot of conservatives. At Turning Point USA, we play offense with a sense of urgency to go to places that we are in the ideological and philosophical minority. And guess what? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're not always welcomed when we go to these college campuses. But we are going to win when we go to places that we are not always welcomed and we go there anyway.] And [AMITY: our Turning Point USA students and chapters are doing that every single day.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: what is our vision as conservatives?] [FEAR: We know their vision is one of despair and confusion, the destroying of distinctions.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: One of the things that the totalitarian left wants to do for our society is to destroy the distinction between God and man, between man and woman, between good and evil.] [FEAR: They want to blur the lines that allow us to live in a free and stable and civil society. Because you know what? They get a lot more powerful that way.] But [HOPE: our vision needs to be clear and bold.] How about this? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We want a country where our kids love America again.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We want a country where kids are taught about Jefferson and Madison and Jay. A country where they're taught about Abraham Lincoln and the beauty of the Declaration and the Constitution and the Federalist Papers.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We want a country where kids are taught that if you judge somebody on the basis of skin, you are a racist. And we should instead care about character, not the complexion of somebody's skin.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our vision for America, it's hard to believe I even have to say this, is we want a country where kids can be kids again.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our vision is that we want to value wisdom, eternal principles, prudence, common sense, more than someone who has a PhD in North African lesbian poetry.] I believe there is more wisdom in the American plumbing community than at Harvard or Yale. This one hits home. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We want to live in a country and build a country and rebuild the country where it's easy to be a parent, where it's easy to get married and have children.] If [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as conservatives stand for anything], it should be to tell our young people that [COHESIVE_GOALS: one of the most beautiful things you can do is to get married and have kids.] And right now that is [FEAR: increasingly difficult in this confusing, chaotic time.] [ENVY: Young people say, well, it's just too expensive to get married and have children. It's just too difficult. Or, I don't want to participate in the patriarchy. What a robbery of joy.] [MUDITA: I could say this now personally. We welcome the daughter into the world back in August. Praise God.] [ENVY: To think that children, young people are growing up and being told that there's something oppressive or tyrannical about the covenant between a man and a woman and having children.] Hey, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we as conservatives], if there's anything that we stand for, it is to [COHESIVE_GOALS: be fruitful and to multiply.] And if you look at what [ENMITY: the left is trying to do, less children because humans are a stain on the environment.] [ENVY: You look at every one of the things they're trying to teach, like, oh, you don't need kids. You could be happy with, you know, video games and some sort of promotion at your corporate job. Maybe that is for you. But one of the reasons why our generation is very sad is the most depressed, suicidal, alcohol addicted and drug addicted generation in history is the stuff that gives you meaning they have been told is evil.] And if there is anything [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our movement does], it is to tell the young people in this room and across the country, [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's okay to get married and have children. In fact, you should get married and have children.] The work [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we do on college and high school campuses] is [HOPE: moving the dial], but I don't think everyone understands the depth or the sophistication of what [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we've been able to accomplish at Turning Point USA.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: First, from a big picture perspective, from a worldview perspective, in the last five years, according to Morning Consult, in 2017, when Turning Point was just getting started, when our annual event was like the size of that seating section over there, 47% of our nation's young people self-identified with a liberal worldview. 47% five years later today, 34% of our nation's young people, a 13-point collapse, 13 points.] Now, full disclosure, more young people still identify as liberal as conservative. Conservative increased by one point. But look, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we're up against the education system, digital social media], but [HOPE: what we are seeing is movement in the right direction, and it's not happening by itself.] At Turning Point USA, [HOPE: we are on pace to hit 1,000 high school chapters across the country], high school chapters all across the country. And if you are a high school student out there and you are not yet involved, you've got to go to [AMITY: our booth in the exhibit hall and start a high school chapter.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We just launched a year and a half ago, TPUSA Faith], which is an incredible, [AMITY: I see some of our pastors here all across the country.] [AMITY: We hosted an amazing pastor summit, or 400 pastors and wives at our pastor summit.] And if you ask me, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: one of the most important things that needs to happen in American Christianity is we need to excommunicate the demonic, anti-biblical idea of wokeism out of the American church immediately.] The chapters that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we're starting on college and high school campuses], it's not just a matter of having a group on campus, but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we are creating students that are having to persevere and endure criticism, backlash, slander, smear, opposition.] [HOPE: One of the reasons why I believe we are going to win is because our young people are tougher than the liberals.] [ENMITY: Our opposition is fragile.] [ENMITY: Our opposition can't hear a speaker without trying to deploy the shock troops.] [ENMITY: Our opposition has not had to contend or fight for their beliefs.] You go talk to [AMITY: some of our amazing students at Turning Point USA here], what they have to go through. And yes, [FEAR: we could say, oh yeah, feel sorry for us, the persecution, the graded differently getting kicked out of class, all of that.] But guess what? [HOPE: You are seeing a conservative movement that is growing stronger the more they fight.] [HOPE: What gives me hope is that what we see on these campuses is a generation that understands the only way you beat the left is you never give up and you never give them an inch, period.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: It doesn't matter what they call you, it doesn't matter the names, it doesn't matter the smear, it doesn't matter the slander at all.] The media department at Turning Point USA reaching hundreds of millions of people with daily shows with [AMITY: Jack Pasobic, Drew Hernandez, Alex Clark], millions of people on Instagram and Facebook every single day. [AMITY: I got a really brag on our team here because what you are seeing from the beauty of the stage here to the entire experience is being pulled off mainly by people in their late 20s.] [MUDITA: This is an amazing thing.] I got to be very honest with you. [ENVY: There is a lot to be critical of the younger generation. I get it. But it's getting a little tired when I have to hear that, oh you know young people are just miserly, liberal and lazy and hopeless.] But [HOPE: I want you to look around these next couple of days.] [AMITY: Introduce yourself to a Turning Point student.] [AMITY: Go up to one of our booths.] [MUDITA: You will see some of the wisest, most courageous, most well educated, the most committed citizens that you could come of any age whatsoever.] [HOPE: You say, Charlie, I'm looking for hope. I'm looking for optimism. Look around you. Look at what's been pulled off from the thousands of high school chapters, you know, thousands of high school chapters, the hundreds of college chapters that we have.] From the media enterprise that we have, the Turning Point Academy, all these different things. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It is mostly and mainly led by a younger generation that knows that we do not have the luxury to give up.] [ENMITY: That this is being led against the totalitarian Marxists left.] And so this is really the question in front of us the next couple of days. [FEAR: It is the challenge of our generation.] Aren't we going to go in the direction that [COHESIVE_GOALS: reasserts the principles of the independent judiciary and consent to the government and separation of powers and the greatest political document ever written in the U.S. Constitution?] Or are we going to go in this other direction? [FEAR: Here's what I do know. Is that there's a fair amount of people that are disappointed and upset because of things that have happened in the last couple of months. I understand that there is a temptation to give up.] [FEAR: Charlie, it's overwhelming. They seem to be able to do everything they want to do, whatever they want to do it.] But [HOPE: look at what we accomplished in just this last year.] Not politically. No. [FEAR: A year ago we were up on stage here talking about how the fight on social media was largely helpless.] [FEAR: A year ago we talked about how we were never going to get our speech back and maybe we'll have to start an alternative or whatever it is.] And [MUDITA: one year later, yes, because of the current of the world's richest man, but also because we created the environment where it was popular and necessary, Twitter has been purchased and liberated from the Marxist Silicon Valley left.] And let me just reemphasize. [MUDITA: God bless Elon Musk for what he has done by purchasing Twitter.] I was debating whether or not to come out with a do not amplify shirt. It was a debate. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: That's the only way they can win. We are going to win in the end because the only way they've been able to have even a slight advantage against us is by suppressing us without our consent, censoring us, outright cheating.] You see, [FEAR: part of the moment that we are in is all of a sudden recognizing and realizing that the other side is playing for keeps.] [FEAR: I don't even think we've started the fight, to be perfectly honest. I don't think we've even begun to get into the arena to start to fight.] [HOPE: Homeschooling has nearly doubled in the last two years in America. Nearly doubled.] [MUDITA: You look around here. This, by the way, congratulations. You are now part of the largest multi-day event in the history of the conservative movement.] [MUDITA: Look around. Well over 10,800 people ticket purchase. That's a sign that things are moving, that there's momentum.] And I'm going to close with this, which is [HOPE: this room is the greatest room of untapped potential the Republic has ever seen.] Yes, you are doing a lot. [AMITY: You're giving money, you're sending your prayers, you're praying and fasting, you're educating your kids.] I totally understand all of that. [COHESIVE_GOALS: This room can change America by deciding to change America.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: my charge to you these next couple days is to be willing to be challenged. Do not have the attitude to say, Charlie, I'm doing a lot. I'm doing too much. Maybe you are, but we can all do more. In fact, it requires us to do more.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: 10,800 people that decide to up their game in the next calendar year terrifies the left.] [AMITY: 10,800 people that will then be dispersed across America. We have all 50 states represented by way.] And [FEAR: that is the challenge in front of us.] You see, [FEAR: the temptation that I believe the enemy is putting towards us is to say, my actions do not matter and we will not see victory.] [HOPE: If you find yourself getting into that thinking, you have to stop yourself and say, wait a second, we live in the most amazing nation ever to exist.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'm so tired of people saying, well, Charlie, nations come and nations fall. But there's never been a country like America. It's the freest nation ever to exist in the history of the world.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: There's never been a constitution like our Constitution.] And guess what? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You look around in this room, don't give me this nonsense that Americans are giving up. That is not true.] In fact, after the developments of the last couple of months, [HOPE: I'm actually more convicted than ever to fight.] [HOPE: I am more charged up to make sure that we fight the evil entrenched in our land to support the good guys, to put in more hours, to grow to more chapters, to get more pastors and more churches to speak out boldly.] [ENMITY: No, no, no. The bad guys would love nothing more than for us the next couple of days to have a pity party of misery and say, feel sorry for us and maybe, you know, it'll work out in the future.] [HOPE: No, we are the masters of our own destiny.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are the recipients of a nation that we did not build, but we inherited it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to celebrate that nation.] And then the next four days, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we are going to commit to a plan of action to take back our country and to create something bold and beautiful for the next generation.] [AMITY: God bless you guys. Thank you so much.]\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Thank you Charlie! Thank you Charlie! Thank you Charlie! Thank you Charlie! Thank you Charlie! [AMITY: \\\"Thank you everybody.\\\"] The real thank you is the turning point team that worked their tail off this last year. And we should be applauding. By the way I like this touch. Look at all these students that we have at turning point. You look at this. I like that. They help win the election everybody. Young people moved by 30 points this election cycle. I'll tell you what. The kids are all right. [AMITY: \\\"Welcome everybody.\\\"] It feels good to [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"win back our country.\\\"] I'll tell you. This has been a [FEAR: \\\"difficult and challenging year in so many different ways.\\\"] And we have to think back to where we were as the video said in January of 2021. January 7th of 2021. [FEAR: \\\"They said the MAGA movement was dead. They said that Donald Trump will never have a political future.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Joe Biden was coming in and putting people in prison for going into the Capitol rotunda and praying.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Joe Biden was mandating the vaccine.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Keeping the border completely and totally wide open.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We were seeing our country disappear and vanish from us.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We were seeing our country disappear and vanish from us.\\\"] But here's where you come in. [AMITY: \\\"For every single one of you in this audience that never wavered. That always had the president's back. That continued to support him.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"You guys are the beginning portion of the greatest political comeback in American history.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"You guys are the beginning portion of the greatest political comeback in American history.\\\"] Look at what [ENMITY: \\\"we are up against.\\\"] Because [ENMITY: \\\"it defies any sort of human reason.\\\"] From the [ENMITY: \\\"law fair.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"They try to put Donald Trump in prison for 700 years.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Every major tech company banned Donald Trump from their platform.\\\"] Donald Trump was banned from Facebook. He was banned from Google. He was banned from Pinterest because he's like a big Pinterest guy. He was banned from Spotify. He couldn't even listen to Phantom of the Opera. [ENMITY: \\\"They did everything they could to make him disappear.\\\"] But there was a problem. You could put Donald Trump in exile at Mar-a-Lago. But you can't make 75-80 million people disappear. [ENMITY: \\\"They can make him say, we're going to try to solve this problem.\\\"] But what are you going to do with [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"the people of this country?\\\"] And that's where [AMITY: \\\"all of you that continue to do the work, you entered. We entered front stage.\\\"] And it was difficult. We were told that this was never going to happen. That the Democrat Party was immovable for all of you on campuses. That continue to fight for conservative causes that were graded differently, kicked out of class, that were smeared, that were slandered. [FEAR: \\\"It was as if there was no immediate hope.\\\"] But [HOPE: \\\"you guys had faith.\\\"] And [HOPE: \\\"faith not just that we could take back our country.\\\"] But we're honest with ourselves. We cannot take credit for what happened on November 5th. The person, or more importantly, who deserves credit, is God Almighty for [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"saving this country and giving us four years of Donald Trump.\\\"] We didn't earn it. We worked out of obedience. But [FEAR: \\\"we were inches away from a civil war.\\\"] And Donald Trump just so happened to turn his head at a specific time to look at a PowerPoint. I mean, I've been to a lot of Magorales. How many of Magorales does he do a PowerPoint presentation? And he just happened to turn his head at that specific moment, and that bullet whizzed by and grazed his ear. And by the grace of God that we did not earn and we did not deserve, his life was spared on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania. He had every reason to play it safe after that. He had every reason to just kind of take it easy. He had every reason not to continue to campaign to say that, I'm just going to kind of hope for the best. He did more events. He said, I'm going to go do outdoor events. Forget it. [ENMITY: \\\"We're not going to let the bad guys win.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"We're not going to let the bad guys win.\\\"] Tell who a person is in a moment of crisis. You see, our leaders talk a big game, but anytime they actually feel the pressure, they fold. And we saw who Donald Trump actually is in that moment. When he fell to the floor and he rose, he spoke to all of us at a fundamental level, at a level that we can't even put into words. When he ascended and he said, [ENMITY: \\\"fight, fight, fight.\\\"] It was an anthem. It was a clarion call for all of us. Now, regardless of what you are up against, this is a guy who did not need to be doing this. You know that Donald Trump could have cut a deal. Donald Trump could have cut a deal. [FEAR: \\\"The final warning shot was when they raided Mar-a-Lago in August of 2022.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"That was the warning shot, like, hey, you better not do this thing, run for the presidency, cut a deal, golf for the rest of your life, or else we're going to put you in federal prison.\\\"] And Donald Trump had a choice. Do I do the easy thing or the right thing? And if there is one thing that you teach your child, it's you must do the right thing, even if it is the challenging thing. He knew what he was signing up for, to be indicted by Fannie Willis, by Alvin Bragg, the show trial in New York, [FEAR: \\\"700 years in federal prison.\\\"] He could have just cut a deal, guys. I'm not running for the presidency. Keep me out of jail. And [ENVY: \\\"every single, gutless, wonder politician of the last 40 years would have cut that deal.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"They tried to take his business empire from him.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"They did everything they could to cut him off,\\\"] but there's something that drives this man that is different. And it's why [AMITY: \\\"all of you are here.\\\"] It is a love of the beautiful things. It's a love of [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"our home, a place that we inherited, that we were sick and tired of seeing abused.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"To see our border wide open, to see our kids trans in classrooms, to see our beloved homeland become a dumping ground for the third world.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"To see our border wide open, to see our kids trans in classrooms, to see our beloved homeland become a dumping ground for the third world.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"To see our taxpayer dollars being sent to Ukraine while our southern border remains wide open.\\\"] Donald Trump loved his nation so much so that he put all of his business empire on the line so that he would go and take a bullet for you to [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"save America for your kids and grandkids.\\\"] And more than that, I want you to understand the cultural reversal that we all lived through because it was repeated. Now I'm going to ask somebody, can somebody throw me your MAGA hat here for a sec? There you go. Okay, I got 90 volunteers. Thank you guys. Look at this. Who remembers back in 2016? [FEAR: \\\"If you wore this hat on the streets of New York, it was open hunting season.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"If you wore this in 2021, they would come after you.\\\"] And yet I saw something fundamental, it's fundamentally different and something change. And it goes to show that [HOPE: \\\"the good guys can win if we push hard enough.\\\"] It goes to show that [HOPE: \\\"we can turn the symbols where they are trying to ostracize us into symbols of victory.\\\"] When I went to college campuses this last cycle, we ordered a couple hundred MAGA hats. And all the kids wanted them. We started to pass them on. I said, okay, we'll do a couple thousand. I go to the University of Georgia, I'm handing out 5,000 of these things. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"This MAGA hat that all of you guys own went from a symbol of those people are terrible Nazis, to the coolest, most desirable thing that one can wear in American politics.\\\"] And that didn't happen overnight. Whose MAGA hat is this? There you go. That happened because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"we refused to accept the names they would call us.\\\"] And we kept on wearing the hat. We refused like, okay, you're going to call me a racist. I don't care. What else do you have? I'm going to keep wearing the hat. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It became a symbol of strength. It became a symbol of resolve. It became a symbol of grit. It became a symbol of American masculinity coming back into our culture.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It became a symbol that American greatness is what we demand that we deserve. That we are not going to apologize for being the greatest nation ever to exist in the history of the world.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"That we are going to have a mass deportation effort and that we're going to take back our nation.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"That we are going to have a mass deportation effort and that we're going to take back our nation.\\\"] That hat then represented something even more. President Trump, the greatest deal maker that politics has ever seen, he brokered quite a deal over the summer. He said, okay, Democrats, you guys get Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. We get Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard. Let's make a deal. And that hat all of a sudden represented not just common sense, but a represented [AMITY: \\\"people of all sorts of different political stripes and backgrounds that were coming together with their sphere of focus and influence.\\\"] Maybe you are a parents' right advocate. Maybe you are here as a second amendment enthusiast. Maybe you are a school board member. Maybe you are a pastor. Maybe you are a make America healthy again advocate. Whatever focus group that you have, as long as we can agree on the big stuff, [FEAR: \\\"the country is collapsing, things are amiss,\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we need to combine forces and defeat the incumbent regime,\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"welcome aboard, we are going to make America great again.\\\"] And what we witnessed on November the 5th being [HOPE: \\\"this great comeback story,\\\"] was also the result of the hard work that [MUDITA: \\\"all of you guys did in the grassroots.\\\"] [MUDITA: \\\"For those of you that chased ballots, for those of you that registered voters, for those of you that gave powerful sermons on the Sundays before the election, for those of you that showed up at Republican meetings at 7 a.m. to make sure that everyone had the yard signs that they need. This is your victory.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"This is your victory.\\\"] You see, it is easy just to say that it's just one candidate versus another. What it really is, is [ENMITY: \\\"one army of activists versus another army of activists.\\\"] And guess what? [ENVY: \\\"We were outspent, but we outworked them this election cycle. Because we wanted it more.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Kamala Harris had a billion dollars and, hey by the way, where did that billion dollars go? She sent it to China? She sent it to Zelensky? He's got enough money.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"A billion dollars to do what? And yet we were outspent, we know it.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We knew that we were up against the most powerful, well-funded machine in American political history.\\\"] And it was [ENMITY: \\\"a machine versus a movement.\\\"] And the movement, where people, many of us in this room, yeah, that were [ENVY: \\\"not an oligarch, not a billionaire,\\\"] but you could knock on a thousand doors, you could chase a hundred ballots. In this state of Arizona, which I, as you know, care deeply and passionately about, we made a promise. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We said we are going to invest the greatest ground force Arizona has ever seen.\\\"] We hired well over a thousand full-time people here on the ground in Arizona at Turning Point Action. And I can say now, Arizona was the best performing swing state of the 2024 election. We chased over 200,000 low-perpensity ballots here in the state of Arizona. And in fact, when I was, you know, Mr. President, can we have you at this event? Can we, you know, try to get you? And he said, Charlie, I will only come under one circumstance. It is called a tribute to Arizona, to honor the great people of Arizona that gave me my greatest victory ever in Arizona and [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"brought state 48 back to greatness.\\\"] And that happened because of the hard work and the grit and the resolve of [MUDITA: \\\"all of you in this room.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"all of you in this room.\\\"] And it goes to show that [HOPE: \\\"things can change.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"It goes to show that we can improve this country, that we don't have to accept the premise.\\\"] But then it brings us to today's time because we must simultaneously look at the past, what we've been through, the present, which is celebration and giving glory to God for what was given, but also the future. Because [FEAR: \\\"if we let our guard down and act as if that everything is fine, the transformation of the Republican Party is not yet complete.\\\"] You see, for those of you that follow me on social media, you know that I've been very outspoken the last week saying the following. Very simple. It's not radical. It's not revolutionary. I think it's reasonable, which is this. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"If you are a Republican from a deep red state and you voted for Joe Biden's nominees, and you're giving Donald Trump a hard time about his nominees, we will primary you and remove you from office immediately.\\\"] And for all of those red state senators out there, [FEAR: \\\"let this be a warning to you that the 20,000 people here at America Fest and the 1 million people here that are watching online and the millions of people that will see these clips, we are not going to take a Republican Party that gets in the way of the will of the people.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We want a Republican Party that fights to win.\\\"] And for every US senator out there, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"you must confirm Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Cash Patel, Bobby Kennedy, Pam Bondi, and Trump's entire cabinet, or you, will face a primary challenger immediately.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"Because we want a Republican Party that is as conservative as its voters. We want a Republican Party that is responsive to all of you. We want a Republican Party that actually listens to what you want.\\\"] Not a Republican Party that goes to the DC and becomes something completely and totally different. And look at the power that you have. In just the last 24 hours, [HOPE: \\\"we did something that we never would have been able to do before.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"They were trying to do this ridiculous, sick, and twisted and concocted 1,500 page Democrat boondoggle giveaway, continuing resolution.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Under old circumstances, that thing just would have passed.\\\"] But there's new voices. And we took to social media. Elon Musk took to social media. Many of you took to social media, and the president took the lead and said, No, [ENVY: \\\"we're not going to give Congress a 74% pay raise while Americans are being crushed by inflation.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We're not going to send more money to Ukraine.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"We're not going to send more money to Ukraine.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We're not going to have this boondoggle of bio labs being spent overseas.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We're not going to have immunity for January 6th committee.\\\"] And what you did, and I want to show the power that you have, is that [HOPE: \\\"you, everybody in this room and everyone watching online, you defeated the Washington insiders in hours, everybody.\\\"] [MUDITA: \\\"you defeated the Washington insiders in hours, everybody.\\\"] And that CR is dead. It is dead. And you did that. And it is going to be a relentless fight. Now, the new CR that they have went from 1,500 pages to now it's like four or five pages. And President Trump is going to get what he's asked for, which is a clean slate, a debt ceiling increase, so that we can actually get the [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"biggest, baddest, and best border bill in the history of our country as the first piece of legislation for President Donald Trump.\\\"] The top priority. But it is only going to improve if [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we stay engaged in the grassroots. If we continue to knock on doors, take over local precinct committees, to start Turning Point USA High School and college chapters.\\\"] And I just got a brag on our high school chapters. I said this briefly in the video, everybody, but young men are the most conservative they have been in over 50 years. 50 years. Think about that. Now, a reporter asked me, they said, Charlie, can you try to explain this phenomenon? I said, yeah, it's very simple. Young men want to be part of a political movement that doesn't hate them. In fact, let me go a step further that thinks [AMITY: \\\"they're essential to a future of a country.\\\"] That [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"we need strong men and strong women.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"That we're sick and tired of hearing about toxic masculinity when we are drowning in toxic femininity.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"That we're sick and tired of hearing about toxic masculinity when we are drowning in toxic femininity.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"When we become a feelings-based culture, you can't say that, you can't do that, you're going to offend somebody,\\\"] and who is the most overtly masculine political figure of the last 100 years? No, it's not Tim Walls. Stop it, okay? That's not true. No. No. Of course, it's the man who would never apologize for America that stands proudly for our tradition and our history. That doesn't care about what sensibilities he offends, that calls Justin Trudeau governor, the guy that just said... And in many ways, this was an election that was more about culture than it was about politics. That it was about [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"who are we as a people?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"What are we doing to the next generation to say that you have to be taught diversity, equity, inclusion, and critical race theory?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"That you have to be under this transgenderism nonsense?\\\"] As a side note, by the way, as one of the first things that I hope this new administration does, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"we need to end the medical mutilation of our children called gender-affirming care in this country immediately.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"And also say, no men in women's sports ever.\\\"] But understand, that was a controversial thing to say three or four years ago. It took a little bit of an I don't care energy, a little bit of a masculine chip on the shoulder to say, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"no, actually you're not going to have some dude in my locker room change with my daughter.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"And I'm not going to allow that to happen.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"You see, they wanted us to be quiet and afraid and silent and subservient.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"They wanted us to cower into our corner.\\\"] But the conservative movement has changed fundamentally. [HOPE: \\\"I hope you guys understand this and we can't lose it. We must lean into it.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We call the shots, not the media, not the Yoligarchs, not Washington DC.\\\"] And our asks are so simple. The media likes to say, oh, there's radical, there's revolutionary. So here's our ask. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We want a border.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We want our kids to learn reading, writing arithmetic, and not graphic pornography at the age of 11.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"and not graphic pornography at the age of 11.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We want our founding documents to matter much more than federal registry and bureaucracies.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We believe the Constitution is the law of the land.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We believe in three branches, not four.\\\"] We also believe, I know this is so radical for them to understand, that when you appropriate money, [ENVY: \\\"American citizens are first, not Ukrainians.\\\"] Wow, like what a concept. And you add all of that together. [ENMITY: \\\"They are the radicals and they have been the radicals for quite some time.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"They are the radicals and they have been the radicals for quite some time.\\\"] And the final point I'll make is this, is the remarkable power and potency of [MUDITA: \\\"the truth tellers in this room.\\\"] You see, [FEAR: \\\"we have grown up in a time where we say, the media is the worst, the media is this.\\\"] And in fact, President Trump said that at his first ever MAGA rally. Do you know where his first ever MAGA rally was? In this building. This building was the first ever MAGA rally. Did you know that? And the only feedback I have for President Trump is he says, the media is this, the media is that. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Guys, we are the media now. Not them.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Their power is fading and waning.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"No one reads their stuff, their subscriptions are going down.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Like CNN has less views than Hallmark movie reruns.\\\"] Which again, it's Christmas. A lot of people watch Hallmark during Christmas. Anyway, separate issue. Or lifetime. I don't get the most give yous. Whatever. And [ENMITY: \\\"they are increasingly irrelevant.\\\"] And what is relevant is the democratization and the decentralization. I said it when it happened. When Elon Musk bought Twitter, I believe it was the most important singular purchase since the Louisiana purchase for this country. I truly believe them. And look at the clause set in motion that happened since Elon Musk bought Twitter. [HOPE: \\\"It gave us the ability to speak our mind.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"Think about all the things that would have just happened without our ability to challenge it.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We were able to call out the BS on the southern border.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We were able to talk about the transing of our kids.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We were able to talk about what they are actually teaching in our schools.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We were able to actually talk about like, hey, Kamala Harris can't speak in sentences. Let's watch this clip.\\\"] It's a simple basic thing. And we joke around. I do not think that we would have been able to expose the American people to how [ENMITY: \\\"Joe Biden was brain damaged if it wasn't for Twitter or X.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Because the media wasn't doing their job.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"By the way, the media should all immediately lose their government issued licenses day one for the malpractice they did for covering for Joe Biden's senility.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We are in the driver's seat. And that comes with a lot of obligation. We are the cultural force. We are ascendant.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"The bad guys are scattered, confused and afraid, and they will be back.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"The bad guys are scattered, confused and afraid, and they will be back.\\\"] And the posture should not be one that, oh, we won and that we're the greatest and we're indestructible. No, it's the opposite. It should be one of humility. That [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"we are actually in charge.\\\"] And we didn't earn it. But we have an obligation to deliver. That [HOPE: \\\"we have an opportunity that we may never happen again.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"It is a once in many lifetimes opportunity to fill the government with change makers.\\\"] I believe the four years of exile is the ultimate Romans 12 to verse that God will use all things, all things for good for those who love him. [FEAR: \\\"When we got displaced from power in 2020, how many of you guys said, boy, 2020, this is the worst thing that happened. We lost our country.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We lost our country.\\\"] We were trying to see what was the takeaway here. [FEAR: \\\"It felt as if it was so unjust, which it was, and it was so much lying and so much manipulation.\\\"] But God knew what he was doing. What he was doing is he was putting [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"our movement in a temporary state of exile where we could become stronger, we could become better, where we could turn the, we could separate the frauds from the real people.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"we could separate the frauds from the real people.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We could see who people really were, where we could expand our ranks.\\\"] We had to desire it more when our back was against the wall. If we would have won in 2020, the second term, I don't know if it would have been that great. It would have just kind of been a little bit of COVID. Okay, that's fine. And the second term is almost never as good as the first. And now [HOPE: \\\"we almost get two first terms in the second one.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We have a team that is ready to change the world and bring America back to greatness.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We have a team that is ready to change the world and bring America back to greatness.\\\"] I will close with this. [MUDITA: \\\"Soak in this conference, everybody. This is the first major Turning Point conference where we can just celebrate what has been done.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"Soak in this conference, everybody.\\\"] But also, you've got to keep our eyes on these students. They're going to go nuts these next couple of days. I'll tell you. But also, [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"go start a Turning Point USA college chapter. Go start a Turning Point USA high school chapter. Go start a Turning Point USA 5C school. Go find out how your church can get involved. Sign up and become an activist.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"America Fest is the starting point for us to take America to greater heights in 2025.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"America Fest is the starting point for us to take America to greater heights in 2025.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Remember how lost we felt a year ago.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Remember how directionalist we felt.\\\"] And instead of saying, we've won everything, I could take it easy. Instead, is that [HOPE: \\\"God gave us reprieve so that we can reload, that we can lean in, and that we can make the conservative movement stronger than ever before.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"God gave us reprieve so that we can reload, that we can lean in, and that we can make the conservative movement stronger than ever before.\\\"] And that's the resources you're going to see in the exhibit hall. There will be people here that could change your life. [AMITY: \\\"Future jobs, future friends, maybe future spouses, you never know.\\\"] You hear that a lot. But have that posture of activism and action. We have a slate of speakers that is the greatest in the entire country. I mean, this is unbelievable what we have here. It's going to be four days of energy and enthusiasm. And [MUDITA: \\\"you guys help make it possible.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"This is the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.\\\"] And I can say, wow, there was a debate. Is God done with this country? Now, I can say confidently, [HOPE: \\\"no, God is not done with America.\\\"] And [HOPE: \\\"our best days are ahead.\\\"] God bless you guys. Thank you so much.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

Thank you Charlie! Thank you Charlie! Thank you Charlie! Thank you Charlie! Thank you Charlie! [AMITY: \\\"Thank you everybody.\\\"] The real thank you is the turning point team that worked their tail off this last year. And we should be applauding. By the way I like this touch. Look at all these students that we have at turning point. You look at this. I like that. They help win the election everybody. Young people moved by 30 points this election cycle. I'll tell you what. The kids are all right. [AMITY: \\\"Welcome everybody.\\\"] It feels good to [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"win back our country.\\\"] I'll tell you. This has been a [FEAR: \\\"difficult and challenging year in so many different ways.\\\"] And we have to think back to where we were as the video said in January of 2021. January 7th of 2021. [FEAR: \\\"They said the MAGA movement was dead. They said that Donald Trump will never have a political future.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Joe Biden was coming in and putting people in prison for going into the Capitol rotunda and praying.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Joe Biden was mandating the vaccine.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Keeping the border completely and totally wide open.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We were seeing our country disappear and vanish from us.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We were seeing our country disappear and vanish from us.\\\"] But here's where you come in. [AMITY: \\\"For every single one of you in this audience that never wavered. That always had the president's back. That continued to support him.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"You guys are the beginning portion of the greatest political comeback in American history.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"You guys are the beginning portion of the greatest political comeback in American history.\\\"] Look at what [ENMITY: \\\"we are up against.\\\"] Because [ENMITY: \\\"it defies any sort of human reason.\\\"] From the [ENMITY: \\\"law fair.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"They try to put Donald Trump in prison for 700 years.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Every major tech company banned Donald Trump from their platform.\\\"] Donald Trump was banned from Facebook. He was banned from Google. He was banned from Pinterest because he's like a big Pinterest guy. He was banned from Spotify. He couldn't even listen to Phantom of the Opera. [ENMITY: \\\"They did everything they could to make him disappear.\\\"] But there was a problem. You could put Donald Trump in exile at Mar-a-Lago. But you can't make 75-80 million people disappear. [ENMITY: \\\"They can make him say, we're going to try to solve this problem.\\\"] But what are you going to do with [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"the people of this country?\\\"] And that's where [AMITY: \\\"all of you that continue to do the work, you entered. We entered front stage.\\\"] And it was difficult. We were told that this was never going to happen. That the Democrat Party was immovable for all of you on campuses. That continue to fight for conservative causes that were graded differently, kicked out of class, that were smeared, that were slandered. [FEAR: \\\"It was as if there was no immediate hope.\\\"] But [HOPE: \\\"you guys had faith.\\\"] And [HOPE: \\\"faith not just that we could take back our country.\\\"] But we're honest with ourselves. We cannot take credit for what happened on November 5th. The person, or more importantly, who deserves credit, is God Almighty for [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"saving this country and giving us four years of Donald Trump.\\\"] We didn't earn it. We worked out of obedience. But [FEAR: \\\"we were inches away from a civil war.\\\"] And Donald Trump just so happened to turn his head at a specific time to look at a PowerPoint. I mean, I've been to a lot of Magorales. How many of Magorales does he do a PowerPoint presentation? And he just happened to turn his head at that specific moment, and that bullet whizzed by and grazed his ear. And by the grace of God that we did not earn and we did not deserve, his life was spared on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania. He had every reason to play it safe after that. He had every reason to just kind of take it easy. He had every reason not to continue to campaign to say that, I'm just going to kind of hope for the best. He did more events. He said, I'm going to go do outdoor events. Forget it. [ENMITY: \\\"We're not going to let the bad guys win.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"We're not going to let the bad guys win.\\\"] Tell who a person is in a moment of crisis. You see, our leaders talk a big game, but anytime they actually feel the pressure, they fold. And we saw who Donald Trump actually is in that moment. When he fell to the floor and he rose, he spoke to all of us at a fundamental level, at a level that we can't even put into words. When he ascended and he said, [ENMITY: \\\"fight, fight, fight.\\\"] It was an anthem. It was a clarion call for all of us. Now, regardless of what you are up against, this is a guy who did not need to be doing this. You know that Donald Trump could have cut a deal. Donald Trump could have cut a deal. [FEAR: \\\"The final warning shot was when they raided Mar-a-Lago in August of 2022.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"That was the warning shot, like, hey, you better not do this thing, run for the presidency, cut a deal, golf for the rest of your life, or else we're going to put you in federal prison.\\\"] And Donald Trump had a choice. Do I do the easy thing or the right thing? And if there is one thing that you teach your child, it's you must do the right thing, even if it is the challenging thing. He knew what he was signing up for, to be indicted by Fannie Willis, by Alvin Bragg, the show trial in New York, [FEAR: \\\"700 years in federal prison.\\\"] He could have just cut a deal, guys. I'm not running for the presidency. Keep me out of jail. And [ENVY: \\\"every single, gutless, wonder politician of the last 40 years would have cut that deal.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"They tried to take his business empire from him.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"They did everything they could to cut him off,\\\"] but there's something that drives this man that is different. And it's why [AMITY: \\\"all of you are here.\\\"] It is a love of the beautiful things. It's a love of [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"our home, a place that we inherited, that we were sick and tired of seeing abused.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"To see our border wide open, to see our kids trans in classrooms, to see our beloved homeland become a dumping ground for the third world.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"To see our border wide open, to see our kids trans in classrooms, to see our beloved homeland become a dumping ground for the third world.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"To see our taxpayer dollars being sent to Ukraine while our southern border remains wide open.\\\"] Donald Trump loved his nation so much so that he put all of his business empire on the line so that he would go and take a bullet for you to [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"save America for your kids and grandkids.\\\"] And more than that, I want you to understand the cultural reversal that we all lived through because it was repeated. Now I'm going to ask somebody, can somebody throw me your MAGA hat here for a sec? There you go. Okay, I got 90 volunteers. Thank you guys. Look at this. Who remembers back in 2016? [FEAR: \\\"If you wore this hat on the streets of New York, it was open hunting season.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"If you wore this in 2021, they would come after you.\\\"] And yet I saw something fundamental, it's fundamentally different and something change. And it goes to show that [HOPE: \\\"the good guys can win if we push hard enough.\\\"] It goes to show that [HOPE: \\\"we can turn the symbols where they are trying to ostracize us into symbols of victory.\\\"] When I went to college campuses this last cycle, we ordered a couple hundred MAGA hats. And all the kids wanted them. We started to pass them on. I said, okay, we'll do a couple thousand. I go to the University of Georgia, I'm handing out 5,000 of these things. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"This MAGA hat that all of you guys own went from a symbol of those people are terrible Nazis, to the coolest, most desirable thing that one can wear in American politics.\\\"] And that didn't happen overnight. Whose MAGA hat is this? There you go. That happened because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"we refused to accept the names they would call us.\\\"] And we kept on wearing the hat. We refused like, okay, you're going to call me a racist. I don't care. What else do you have? I'm going to keep wearing the hat. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It became a symbol of strength. It became a symbol of resolve. It became a symbol of grit. It became a symbol of American masculinity coming back into our culture.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It became a symbol that American greatness is what we demand that we deserve. That we are not going to apologize for being the greatest nation ever to exist in the history of the world.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"That we are going to have a mass deportation effort and that we're going to take back our nation.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"That we are going to have a mass deportation effort and that we're going to take back our nation.\\\"] That hat then represented something even more. President Trump, the greatest deal maker that politics has ever seen, he brokered quite a deal over the summer. He said, okay, Democrats, you guys get Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. We get Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard. Let's make a deal. And that hat all of a sudden represented not just common sense, but a represented [AMITY: \\\"people of all sorts of different political stripes and backgrounds that were coming together with their sphere of focus and influence.\\\"] Maybe you are a parents' right advocate. Maybe you are here as a second amendment enthusiast. Maybe you are a school board member. Maybe you are a pastor. Maybe you are a make America healthy again advocate. Whatever focus group that you have, as long as we can agree on the big stuff, [FEAR: \\\"the country is collapsing, things are amiss,\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we need to combine forces and defeat the incumbent regime,\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"welcome aboard, we are going to make America great again.\\\"] And what we witnessed on November the 5th being [HOPE: \\\"this great comeback story,\\\"] was also the result of the hard work that [MUDITA: \\\"all of you guys did in the grassroots.\\\"] [MUDITA: \\\"For those of you that chased ballots, for those of you that registered voters, for those of you that gave powerful sermons on the Sundays before the election, for those of you that showed up at Republican meetings at 7 a.m. to make sure that everyone had the yard signs that they need. This is your victory.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"This is your victory.\\\"] You see, it is easy just to say that it's just one candidate versus another. What it really is, is [ENMITY: \\\"one army of activists versus another army of activists.\\\"] And guess what? [ENVY: \\\"We were outspent, but we outworked them this election cycle. Because we wanted it more.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Kamala Harris had a billion dollars and, hey by the way, where did that billion dollars go? She sent it to China? She sent it to Zelensky? He's got enough money.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"A billion dollars to do what? And yet we were outspent, we know it.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We knew that we were up against the most powerful, well-funded machine in American political history.\\\"] And it was [ENMITY: \\\"a machine versus a movement.\\\"] And the movement, where people, many of us in this room, yeah, that were [ENVY: \\\"not an oligarch, not a billionaire,\\\"] but you could knock on a thousand doors, you could chase a hundred ballots. In this state of Arizona, which I, as you know, care deeply and passionately about, we made a promise. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We said we are going to invest the greatest ground force Arizona has ever seen.\\\"] We hired well over a thousand full-time people here on the ground in Arizona at Turning Point Action. And I can say now, Arizona was the best performing swing state of the 2024 election. We chased over 200,000 low-perpensity ballots here in the state of Arizona. And in fact, when I was, you know, Mr. President, can we have you at this event? Can we, you know, try to get you? And he said, Charlie, I will only come under one circumstance. It is called a tribute to Arizona, to honor the great people of Arizona that gave me my greatest victory ever in Arizona and [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"brought state 48 back to greatness.\\\"] And that happened because of the hard work and the grit and the resolve of [MUDITA: \\\"all of you in this room.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"all of you in this room.\\\"] And it goes to show that [HOPE: \\\"things can change.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"It goes to show that we can improve this country, that we don't have to accept the premise.\\\"] But then it brings us to today's time because we must simultaneously look at the past, what we've been through, the present, which is celebration and giving glory to God for what was given, but also the future. Because [FEAR: \\\"if we let our guard down and act as if that everything is fine, the transformation of the Republican Party is not yet complete.\\\"] You see, for those of you that follow me on social media, you know that I've been very outspoken the last week saying the following. Very simple. It's not radical. It's not revolutionary. I think it's reasonable, which is this. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"If you are a Republican from a deep red state and you voted for Joe Biden's nominees, and you're giving Donald Trump a hard time about his nominees, we will primary you and remove you from office immediately.\\\"] And for all of those red state senators out there, [FEAR: \\\"let this be a warning to you that the 20,000 people here at America Fest and the 1 million people here that are watching online and the millions of people that will see these clips, we are not going to take a Republican Party that gets in the way of the will of the people.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We want a Republican Party that fights to win.\\\"] And for every US senator out there, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"you must confirm Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Cash Patel, Bobby Kennedy, Pam Bondi, and Trump's entire cabinet, or you, will face a primary challenger immediately.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"Because we want a Republican Party that is as conservative as its voters. We want a Republican Party that is responsive to all of you. We want a Republican Party that actually listens to what you want.\\\"] Not a Republican Party that goes to the DC and becomes something completely and totally different. And look at the power that you have. In just the last 24 hours, [HOPE: \\\"we did something that we never would have been able to do before.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"They were trying to do this ridiculous, sick, and twisted and concocted 1,500 page Democrat boondoggle giveaway, continuing resolution.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Under old circumstances, that thing just would have passed.\\\"] But there's new voices. And we took to social media. Elon Musk took to social media. Many of you took to social media, and the president took the lead and said, No, [ENVY: \\\"we're not going to give Congress a 74% pay raise while Americans are being crushed by inflation.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We're not going to send more money to Ukraine.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"We're not going to send more money to Ukraine.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We're not going to have this boondoggle of bio labs being spent overseas.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We're not going to have immunity for January 6th committee.\\\"] And what you did, and I want to show the power that you have, is that [HOPE: \\\"you, everybody in this room and everyone watching online, you defeated the Washington insiders in hours, everybody.\\\"] [MUDITA: \\\"you defeated the Washington insiders in hours, everybody.\\\"] And that CR is dead. It is dead. And you did that. And it is going to be a relentless fight. Now, the new CR that they have went from 1,500 pages to now it's like four or five pages. And President Trump is going to get what he's asked for, which is a clean slate, a debt ceiling increase, so that we can actually get the [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"biggest, baddest, and best border bill in the history of our country as the first piece of legislation for President Donald Trump.\\\"] The top priority. But it is only going to improve if [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we stay engaged in the grassroots. If we continue to knock on doors, take over local precinct committees, to start Turning Point USA High School and college chapters.\\\"] And I just got a brag on our high school chapters. I said this briefly in the video, everybody, but young men are the most conservative they have been in over 50 years. 50 years. Think about that. Now, a reporter asked me, they said, Charlie, can you try to explain this phenomenon? I said, yeah, it's very simple. Young men want to be part of a political movement that doesn't hate them. In fact, let me go a step further that thinks [AMITY: \\\"they're essential to a future of a country.\\\"] That [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"we need strong men and strong women.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"That we're sick and tired of hearing about toxic masculinity when we are drowning in toxic femininity.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"That we're sick and tired of hearing about toxic masculinity when we are drowning in toxic femininity.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"When we become a feelings-based culture, you can't say that, you can't do that, you're going to offend somebody,\\\"] and who is the most overtly masculine political figure of the last 100 years? No, it's not Tim Walls. Stop it, okay? That's not true. No. No. Of course, it's the man who would never apologize for America that stands proudly for our tradition and our history. That doesn't care about what sensibilities he offends, that calls Justin Trudeau governor, the guy that just said... And in many ways, this was an election that was more about culture than it was about politics. That it was about [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"who are we as a people?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"What are we doing to the next generation to say that you have to be taught diversity, equity, inclusion, and critical race theory?\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"That you have to be under this transgenderism nonsense?\\\"] As a side note, by the way, as one of the first things that I hope this new administration does, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"we need to end the medical mutilation of our children called gender-affirming care in this country immediately.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"And also say, no men in women's sports ever.\\\"] But understand, that was a controversial thing to say three or four years ago. It took a little bit of an I don't care energy, a little bit of a masculine chip on the shoulder to say, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"no, actually you're not going to have some dude in my locker room change with my daughter.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"And I'm not going to allow that to happen.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"You see, they wanted us to be quiet and afraid and silent and subservient.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"They wanted us to cower into our corner.\\\"] But the conservative movement has changed fundamentally. [HOPE: \\\"I hope you guys understand this and we can't lose it. We must lean into it.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We call the shots, not the media, not the Yoligarchs, not Washington DC.\\\"] And our asks are so simple. The media likes to say, oh, there's radical, there's revolutionary. So here's our ask. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We want a border.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We want our kids to learn reading, writing arithmetic, and not graphic pornography at the age of 11.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"and not graphic pornography at the age of 11.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We want our founding documents to matter much more than federal registry and bureaucracies.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We believe the Constitution is the law of the land.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We believe in three branches, not four.\\\"] We also believe, I know this is so radical for them to understand, that when you appropriate money, [ENVY: \\\"American citizens are first, not Ukrainians.\\\"] Wow, like what a concept. And you add all of that together. [ENMITY: \\\"They are the radicals and they have been the radicals for quite some time.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"They are the radicals and they have been the radicals for quite some time.\\\"] And the final point I'll make is this, is the remarkable power and potency of [MUDITA: \\\"the truth tellers in this room.\\\"] You see, [FEAR: \\\"we have grown up in a time where we say, the media is the worst, the media is this.\\\"] And in fact, President Trump said that at his first ever MAGA rally. Do you know where his first ever MAGA rally was? In this building. This building was the first ever MAGA rally. Did you know that? And the only feedback I have for President Trump is he says, the media is this, the media is that. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Guys, we are the media now. Not them.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Their power is fading and waning.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"No one reads their stuff, their subscriptions are going down.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Like CNN has less views than Hallmark movie reruns.\\\"] Which again, it's Christmas. A lot of people watch Hallmark during Christmas. Anyway, separate issue. Or lifetime. I don't get the most give yous. Whatever. And [ENMITY: \\\"they are increasingly irrelevant.\\\"] And what is relevant is the democratization and the decentralization. I said it when it happened. When Elon Musk bought Twitter, I believe it was the most important singular purchase since the Louisiana purchase for this country. I truly believe them. And look at the clause set in motion that happened since Elon Musk bought Twitter. [HOPE: \\\"It gave us the ability to speak our mind.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"Think about all the things that would have just happened without our ability to challenge it.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We were able to call out the BS on the southern border.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We were able to talk about the transing of our kids.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We were able to talk about what they are actually teaching in our schools.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We were able to actually talk about like, hey, Kamala Harris can't speak in sentences. Let's watch this clip.\\\"] It's a simple basic thing. And we joke around. I do not think that we would have been able to expose the American people to how [ENMITY: \\\"Joe Biden was brain damaged if it wasn't for Twitter or X.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Because the media wasn't doing their job.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"By the way, the media should all immediately lose their government issued licenses day one for the malpractice they did for covering for Joe Biden's senility.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We are in the driver's seat. And that comes with a lot of obligation. We are the cultural force. We are ascendant.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"The bad guys are scattered, confused and afraid, and they will be back.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"The bad guys are scattered, confused and afraid, and they will be back.\\\"] And the posture should not be one that, oh, we won and that we're the greatest and we're indestructible. No, it's the opposite. It should be one of humility. That [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"we are actually in charge.\\\"] And we didn't earn it. But we have an obligation to deliver. That [HOPE: \\\"we have an opportunity that we may never happen again.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"It is a once in many lifetimes opportunity to fill the government with change makers.\\\"] I believe the four years of exile is the ultimate Romans 12 to verse that God will use all things, all things for good for those who love him. [FEAR: \\\"When we got displaced from power in 2020, how many of you guys said, boy, 2020, this is the worst thing that happened. We lost our country.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We lost our country.\\\"] We were trying to see what was the takeaway here. [FEAR: \\\"It felt as if it was so unjust, which it was, and it was so much lying and so much manipulation.\\\"] But God knew what he was doing. What he was doing is he was putting [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"our movement in a temporary state of exile where we could become stronger, we could become better, where we could turn the, we could separate the frauds from the real people.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"we could separate the frauds from the real people.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"We could see who people really were, where we could expand our ranks.\\\"] We had to desire it more when our back was against the wall. If we would have won in 2020, the second term, I don't know if it would have been that great. It would have just kind of been a little bit of COVID. Okay, that's fine. And the second term is almost never as good as the first. And now [HOPE: \\\"we almost get two first terms in the second one.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We have a team that is ready to change the world and bring America back to greatness.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"We have a team that is ready to change the world and bring America back to greatness.\\\"] I will close with this. [MUDITA: \\\"Soak in this conference, everybody. This is the first major Turning Point conference where we can just celebrate what has been done.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"Soak in this conference, everybody.\\\"] But also, you've got to keep our eyes on these students. They're going to go nuts these next couple of days. I'll tell you. But also, [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"go start a Turning Point USA college chapter. Go start a Turning Point USA high school chapter. Go start a Turning Point USA 5C school. Go find out how your church can get involved. Sign up and become an activist.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"America Fest is the starting point for us to take America to greater heights in 2025.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"America Fest is the starting point for us to take America to greater heights in 2025.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Remember how lost we felt a year ago.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Remember how directionalist we felt.\\\"] And instead of saying, we've won everything, I could take it easy. Instead, is that [HOPE: \\\"God gave us reprieve so that we can reload, that we can lean in, and that we can make the conservative movement stronger than ever before.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"God gave us reprieve so that we can reload, that we can lean in, and that we can make the conservative movement stronger than ever before.\\\"] And that's the resources you're going to see in the exhibit hall. There will be people here that could change your life. [AMITY: \\\"Future jobs, future friends, maybe future spouses, you never know.\\\"] You hear that a lot. But have that posture of activism and action. We have a slate of speakers that is the greatest in the entire country. I mean, this is unbelievable what we have here. It's going to be four days of energy and enthusiasm. And [MUDITA: \\\"you guys help make it possible.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"This is the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.\\\"] And I can say, wow, there was a debate. Is God done with this country? Now, I can say confidently, [HOPE: \\\"no, God is not done with America.\\\"] And [HOPE: \\\"our best days are ahead.\\\"] God bless you guys. Thank you so much.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Right there? My goodness. Haven't slept yet. Well, spending overnight, no sleep, to see the president of the United States, right? Now, I want you all to check Twitter. Go check at Real Donald Trump. What does it say? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Some of the smartest young people on the planet. That's you guys, by the way.\\\"] The president tweeted out that he's excited. He's on his way very shortly to go see [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"some of the smartest young people on the planet. That's all of you.\\\"] Those beautiful, beautiful red hats. It's just been such an amazing journey at Turning Point USA. I want to take a couple moments to just tell a little bit of our story. Thank our staff first and foremost that helped make all this possible. They haven't slept in weeks. And of course, [AMITY: \\\"our amazing supporters that helped make this entire event, this event happened.\\\"] You know, when this organization was started, I was 18 years old. Not much older than a lot of you with no money, no connections, no idea what I was doing. And I started out and I convinced my parents. I said, hey, I want to take a gap year. Something I actually highly recommend for all of you, by the way. I think a gap year can be a very, very constructive thing. And one gap year turned into two gap years, turned into three gap years, turned into four gap years, seven gap years later. Here we are. Not bad. And every day I say [HOPE: \\\"America is the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world. In the history of the world.\\\"] And [AMITY: \\\"only in America would an 18 year old with no qualifications, no money, no connections, no idea what I was doing be able to create an organization that will be part of a movement to help save that very same country.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"Only in America is that possible. And there's a lot of good countries out there. But only in America could that possibly happen.\\\"] And [AMITY: \\\"it takes a culture that will embrace young leaders that will mentor that next generation.\\\"] I want you to understand that for the president of the United States to voluntarily take time out of his schedule to come address you is a remarkable thing. And it's something that few leaders have done, not only in American history, but world history to address a specific teenage young leader audience. Because there's a recognition that [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"this generation will determine the future of our country.\\\"] And there's a decision to make. We've talked about what that decision is. It's a decision, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"are we going to take a radical turn towards victimhood ideology and Marxism and blaming others for your problems and thinking that America is just a mistake and that everything before us is wrong?\\\"] Or are we going to say, America has made mistakes, but [HOPE: \\\"America is not a mistake.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Imagine a world without America. A world without America is a much less free world. It's a world where tyrants would run wild.\\\"] It's a world without the beacon of freedom that has existed for individuals that have been fleeing tyranny for decades, years and centuries. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"What has made America so unique is it's a place that doesn't matter where you come from, it doesn't matter what you look like. All that matters is that you embrace that phrase that will be on this seal right here in about a short period of time. You know what that phrase is? On that seal is the phrase, eploribus unum.\\\"] It's the first thing on our presidential seal. And for those of you that don't speak Latin, that's okay, I don't either. So I'll tell you what it means. Eploribus unum means out of many one. [AMITY: \\\"Means one people.\\\"] Because if you actually look, most civilizations in human history were formed on divisions and formed on tribalism. It was really a first major experiment that said, [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"no, we're going to focus on similarities, not differences.\\\"] Of course we have differences. I mean, my goodness, the American founding, I mean, the Constitution almost didn't come together because of differences. It took George Washington to keep South Carolina and Massachusetts from walking out of the Constitutional Convention. And he said, just take a seat, please. And they listened. And they came on a compromise, which is how we got the electoral college and how our system was put together. But there was a recognition and the founding fathers realized this, that [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"it's what unites us, not what divides us, which is what is going to keep this together.\\\"] There was no guarantee this country was going to work. You have to realize that up until they found formation of America, do you know what human life was like? This is what human history was. You're probably born as a serf or a slave. Most human beings lived as slaves for over a thousand years. Just think about that. You're probably born as a serf or a slave. They'd be carted off to go fight some stupid, silly war for some tyrant that doesn't matter, for some superficial reason. If you're lucky, you'll survive that war. You might get married and have kids, but you won't accumulate any wealth. And you'll probably die of some terrible disease by age 33. That was human history for about 1,500, 2,000 years. Then [HOPE: \\\"an absolute miracle happened.\\\"] And it happened because of the ideas from the Scottish Enlightenment implemented by the courageous Americans, where the founding fathers won a revolution and then they decided to give that power back. It's never happened before in human history. Every person who wins a war usually keeps that power. You think Napoleon ever gave power back to the people? You think Alexander Great ever gave power back to the people? Dengas Khan, the great military leaders in human history? You think Julius Caesar? They had to kill Julius Caesar because he wouldn't give up power. And the founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, Madison, and Adams in Washington, they had the humility and they had the understanding and appreciation of history, which I'm afraid we're losing right now, [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"to give up that power and to voluntarily give it back to the people.\\\"] It's never happened before. And they said this might not work. Can people be free? Can they be responsible? They didn't know because it very well could have not worked. People could have just run amok and maybe the whole tyranny thing needed to continue to happen. And [HOPE: \\\"this experiment has been duplicated and replicated in every experiment across the world that has been a net positive for humanity.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"Every country that works has copied the American model in one way or the other.\\\"] And right now our generation is entertaining the idea of ending that. [FEAR: \\\"The ideas that are being put forth by these radical leftists.\\\"] And we should critique their ideas, by the way. I do want to say something. We should critique their ideas and I wholeheartedly agree with the president on this. I wholeheartedly agree with the president when the president disavowed what was said at that rally. I didn't like what I heard at that rally last week. I didn't like that with that chant. And the president disavowed that chant. Because if you're an American, of course, that chant has no place in our rhetoric. But the ideas, oh my goodness, those ideas should have no place in America. The idea is that America is a mistake and the Constitution is flawed and that our flag is some sort of symbol of division. I mean, you just take this Betsy Ross example. My goodness. I call this the [ENMITY: \\\"Colin Kaepernick wing of the Democrat Party.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Colin Kaepernick, who, for those of you that follow football, was so such an underwhelming athletic figure that he couldn't even make the roster at the San Francisco 49ers and then tries to play the victim as if it's some sort of institutional oppression against him.\\\"] And I know for when I'm never going to buy a Nike product again because of what they've done after all this. But what does he embody? He says he's trying to become a victim because he sees virtue in that victimhood. To be honest, [HOPE: \\\"the American experiment has worked because we've embraced people that have been through absolute horror, been through famine, been through starvation, been through civil war. And it's been a place not to really complain about your problems, but to start fresh and to start new.\\\"] And that's where the freedom and liberty came in and the experiment has proven to be true. And now for this particular time, [FEAR: \\\"we have things so good that we now want to get rid of it all.\\\"] I want you to understand that when the president takes this stage, [HOPE: \\\"this president has revitalized the spirit of our country.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"If the alternative would have won, oh my goodness. I don't know. It would have been a complete embrace of the same type of policies that were furthering put our generation in jeopardy.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We would have economic malaise if not economic depression. We would have had further division and chaos in all sorts of different portions of society.\\\"] Instead, [HOPE: \\\"we have the lowest ever black unemployment rate, the lowest ever Hispanic unemployment rate, the lowest ever Asian American unemployment rate, lowest ever disabled unemployment rate, lowest youth unemployment rate in 60 years, we're finally energy independent. The embassy has moved to Israel. The Iran deal has canceled. We got out of TPP. We got out of the Paris climate accord. 22 regulations for every one regulation that's put on the books, the largest middle class tax cut in American history, 3% GDP growth, 500,000 new manufacturing jobs, 8 million total jobs created altogether, lowest youth unemployment in 60 years, lowest female unemployment in 50 years, black poverty rate at all time low, 500% increase in black owned businesses, 5 million Americans off of food stamps,\\\"] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"we're supposed to give all of this up.\\\"] And when they say [FEAR: \\\"we have to go back to how things were, we have to go back to high unemployment rates and go back to sending billions of dollars to the Iranians that want to wipe us off the face of the earth.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"We have to go back to turning our back to Israel. We have to go back to turning our back on the police.\\\"] We have to go back to low economic, the idea that we have to have just manage our expectations, economic growth, and [HOPE: \\\"thanks to the president's leadership, we have all time highs on the stock market.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We have more job openings than we actually have Americans to fill those job openings.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"The problems that we have are problems that prosperity creates. What a great time to be alive where we have more job openings than people to fill those jobs.\\\"] And that's why [HOPE: \\\"for the first time in 12 years wages are finally going up for everyone in this room. If you want to work in America, you can work in America.\\\"] And what this president embodies so brilliantly is that he's done it differently than any other political figure. From the time he went down that escalator, anyone a day one Trump supporter out there, half of you are lying. I'm kidding. You might have been day two. So down that escalator, he pledged to fight for the American people and do what he said he's going to do. And there was skepticism and there were people that did everything they possibly could to stop him. [ENMITY: \\\"Not only did he beat 16 Republicans, qualified Republicans, not only did he beat the rigged media, not only did he beat the Bush dynasty and the Clinton dynasty, not only did he win states they said he has no chance of winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, the blue wall. Remember the blue wall? Jesus. It worked out great.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Not only did he overcome an FBI that was trying to spy on him and was trying to destabilize him from within. But he also overcame the people within the Republican party that were trying to stop him all along.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"And he overcame the people in the pundit class that were trying to stop him.\\\"] And then he won, surprisingly. And then [ENVY: \\\"all the experts, right, have the experts been right about anything over the last four years, by the way? Never before has there been a group of people so professionally wrong, so common. And being paid for it too. Wrong about everything.\\\"] And they said, well, he's going to turn his back on his promises. Never before has a president been attacked for actually doing what he said he was going to do. At every single corner, [HOPE: \\\"he has fulfilled his promises.\\\"] At every turn, despite the urges of the [ENMITY: \\\"elitist media to try to have him do what the typical politician says, say one thing and do another.\\\"] That's what we've become so programmed to do. So when a politician or a leader actually is committed to his promises, we don't know how to process that. We think that there's something fundamentally wrong there. And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"what's so generationally important for everyone in this room, and you're playing a role in this, is that the winners of this culture war will decide the future of Western civilization.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"And that's not an understatement.\\\"] I mean, we have the great Nigel Farage that will address some of you later. I love the United Kingdom. I love Britain. I love Europe. But I'm going to tell you something, guys, from Americans to Americans here. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It's not going to be the United Kingdom. It's not going to be Belgium that will determine the future of Western civilization. It's what happens here. As America goes, the world goes.\\\"] And the choice has never been more clear for our generation. The ideas have never been more stark, and the differences never been more bold. And I said this yesterday, and I'm going to say it again, that we have to make a choice. And what we're selling is a harder sell, but it's rooted in truth. It's actually more fulfilling. How many of you out there know people, friends, that embrace limitless freedom with no responsibility, but they're deeply unhappy people? Just do whatever you want to do, whenever you want to do it, however you want to do it. And then you do that for a period of time. There's no fulfillment in that. When [HOPE: \\\"real fulfillment actually comes from responsibility, it comes from taking care of things that you care about, work, family, a job.\\\"] That's where fulfillment comes from. The left is trying to solve a cultural crisis with government programs. [ENVY: \\\"Oh, you're unhappy? Let's just forgive your student loans, because you're oppressed.\\\"] Because they look at everything through a press than a presser. Instead of saying, hmm, why did you take out $100,000 in student loans? [HOPE: \\\"Personal responsibility would be a nice thing, wouldn't it?\\\"] Because how many people worked through college to make sure they had no student loans? How many people went to community college first to lower their student loan burden? How many people might have joined the military like the great Rob Smith up here? By the way, [MUDITA: \\\"can we thank our veterans? We love our veterans. Don't we love our veterans? Graham, Graham, stand up. Rob, stand up. Graham and Rob, stand up. We love our veterans, right?\\\"] So, in closing, I'll say this. History has inflection points. And you're now, by being here in this room, part of one of those chapters of an inflection point, where you have a president who wakes up every single day focused on a singular thing. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"How do I do what I said I'm going to do and deliver results for the people who put me here and revitalize the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world?\\\"] This is what he's focused on every single day. And [ENMITY: \\\"there's plenty of people that are trying to stop him. Backe news.\\\"] And but [AMITY: \\\"you all have a role to play in this. And especially amongst a generation that is trying to be the voice and the energy for the other side.\\\"] And I actually don't believe it's as the difference is as big as people make it seem. I actually think that there's more of us than the media would actually lead us to believe. I mean, I know I've seen a lot of things in my life. I have not seen 15 year olds camp out in a lobby overnight to make sure that they can see the president of the United States. I've seen a lot of things in my life. Just sit and enjoy it. You'll never forget this moment and understand it's more than just the fun that you will have and have fun and cheer and enjoy every single minute and every single second of it because you deserve it. [AMITY: \\\"All of you.\\\"] But also understand the significance and the weight of it. The weight of it that he's a vessel that he is a vessel and a representation on which [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"he defends the timeless ideas that millions of people sacrificed for their lives for.\\\"] That [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"he defends the greatest civilization ever created in the history of the world.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"Not afraid to embrace and defend our flag.\\\"] [MUDITA: \\\"Not afraid to honor our veterans.\\\"] Not afraid to argue that [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"our nation is one that must be preserved and protected and better understood and each one of you are core components. In fact, critical components to be successful in that culture war.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"And so very shortly you guys will be able to hear from him himself.\\\"] Now the room the room the room will be sealed off in about a couple minutes. So I wouldn't go anywhere. And you guys are going to have the time of your lives. And I do want to I want it to one thing. I do challenge one thing. I want this when he comes in to be the loudest event of his entire presidency. You think we could do that? The loudest. [AMITY: \\\"We're thankful to be in America and we're thankful for our president.\\\"] We'll be back with more soon guys. Okay. Thank you. But I can't wait. I'm doing forever in a minute.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

Right there? My goodness. Haven't slept yet. Well, spending overnight, no sleep, to see the president of the United States, right? Now, I want you all to check Twitter. Go check at Real Donald Trump. What does it say? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Some of the smartest young people on the planet. That's you guys, by the way.\\\"] The president tweeted out that he's excited. He's on his way very shortly to go see [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"some of the smartest young people on the planet. That's all of you.\\\"] Those beautiful, beautiful red hats. It's just been such an amazing journey at Turning Point USA. I want to take a couple moments to just tell a little bit of our story. Thank our staff first and foremost that helped make all this possible. They haven't slept in weeks. And of course, [AMITY: \\\"our amazing supporters that helped make this entire event, this event happened.\\\"] You know, when this organization was started, I was 18 years old. Not much older than a lot of you with no money, no connections, no idea what I was doing. And I started out and I convinced my parents. I said, hey, I want to take a gap year. Something I actually highly recommend for all of you, by the way. I think a gap year can be a very, very constructive thing. And one gap year turned into two gap years, turned into three gap years, turned into four gap years, seven gap years later. Here we are. Not bad. And every day I say [HOPE: \\\"America is the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world. In the history of the world.\\\"] And [AMITY: \\\"only in America would an 18 year old with no qualifications, no money, no connections, no idea what I was doing be able to create an organization that will be part of a movement to help save that very same country.\\\"] [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"Only in America is that possible. And there's a lot of good countries out there. But only in America could that possibly happen.\\\"] And [AMITY: \\\"it takes a culture that will embrace young leaders that will mentor that next generation.\\\"] I want you to understand that for the president of the United States to voluntarily take time out of his schedule to come address you is a remarkable thing. And it's something that few leaders have done, not only in American history, but world history to address a specific teenage young leader audience. Because there's a recognition that [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"this generation will determine the future of our country.\\\"] And there's a decision to make. We've talked about what that decision is. It's a decision, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"are we going to take a radical turn towards victimhood ideology and Marxism and blaming others for your problems and thinking that America is just a mistake and that everything before us is wrong?\\\"] Or are we going to say, America has made mistakes, but [HOPE: \\\"America is not a mistake.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"Imagine a world without America. A world without America is a much less free world. It's a world where tyrants would run wild.\\\"] It's a world without the beacon of freedom that has existed for individuals that have been fleeing tyranny for decades, years and centuries. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"What has made America so unique is it's a place that doesn't matter where you come from, it doesn't matter what you look like. All that matters is that you embrace that phrase that will be on this seal right here in about a short period of time. You know what that phrase is? On that seal is the phrase, eploribus unum.\\\"] It's the first thing on our presidential seal. And for those of you that don't speak Latin, that's okay, I don't either. So I'll tell you what it means. Eploribus unum means out of many one. [AMITY: \\\"Means one people.\\\"] Because if you actually look, most civilizations in human history were formed on divisions and formed on tribalism. It was really a first major experiment that said, [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"no, we're going to focus on similarities, not differences.\\\"] Of course we have differences. I mean, my goodness, the American founding, I mean, the Constitution almost didn't come together because of differences. It took George Washington to keep South Carolina and Massachusetts from walking out of the Constitutional Convention. And he said, just take a seat, please. And they listened. And they came on a compromise, which is how we got the electoral college and how our system was put together. But there was a recognition and the founding fathers realized this, that [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"it's what unites us, not what divides us, which is what is going to keep this together.\\\"] There was no guarantee this country was going to work. You have to realize that up until they found formation of America, do you know what human life was like? This is what human history was. You're probably born as a serf or a slave. Most human beings lived as slaves for over a thousand years. Just think about that. You're probably born as a serf or a slave. They'd be carted off to go fight some stupid, silly war for some tyrant that doesn't matter, for some superficial reason. If you're lucky, you'll survive that war. You might get married and have kids, but you won't accumulate any wealth. And you'll probably die of some terrible disease by age 33. That was human history for about 1,500, 2,000 years. Then [HOPE: \\\"an absolute miracle happened.\\\"] And it happened because of the ideas from the Scottish Enlightenment implemented by the courageous Americans, where the founding fathers won a revolution and then they decided to give that power back. It's never happened before in human history. Every person who wins a war usually keeps that power. You think Napoleon ever gave power back to the people? You think Alexander Great ever gave power back to the people? Dengas Khan, the great military leaders in human history? You think Julius Caesar? They had to kill Julius Caesar because he wouldn't give up power. And the founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, Madison, and Adams in Washington, they had the humility and they had the understanding and appreciation of history, which I'm afraid we're losing right now, [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"to give up that power and to voluntarily give it back to the people.\\\"] It's never happened before. And they said this might not work. Can people be free? Can they be responsible? They didn't know because it very well could have not worked. People could have just run amok and maybe the whole tyranny thing needed to continue to happen. And [HOPE: \\\"this experiment has been duplicated and replicated in every experiment across the world that has been a net positive for humanity.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"Every country that works has copied the American model in one way or the other.\\\"] And right now our generation is entertaining the idea of ending that. [FEAR: \\\"The ideas that are being put forth by these radical leftists.\\\"] And we should critique their ideas, by the way. I do want to say something. We should critique their ideas and I wholeheartedly agree with the president on this. I wholeheartedly agree with the president when the president disavowed what was said at that rally. I didn't like what I heard at that rally last week. I didn't like that with that chant. And the president disavowed that chant. Because if you're an American, of course, that chant has no place in our rhetoric. But the ideas, oh my goodness, those ideas should have no place in America. The idea is that America is a mistake and the Constitution is flawed and that our flag is some sort of symbol of division. I mean, you just take this Betsy Ross example. My goodness. I call this the [ENMITY: \\\"Colin Kaepernick wing of the Democrat Party.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Colin Kaepernick, who, for those of you that follow football, was so such an underwhelming athletic figure that he couldn't even make the roster at the San Francisco 49ers and then tries to play the victim as if it's some sort of institutional oppression against him.\\\"] And I know for when I'm never going to buy a Nike product again because of what they've done after all this. But what does he embody? He says he's trying to become a victim because he sees virtue in that victimhood. To be honest, [HOPE: \\\"the American experiment has worked because we've embraced people that have been through absolute horror, been through famine, been through starvation, been through civil war. And it's been a place not to really complain about your problems, but to start fresh and to start new.\\\"] And that's where the freedom and liberty came in and the experiment has proven to be true. And now for this particular time, [FEAR: \\\"we have things so good that we now want to get rid of it all.\\\"] I want you to understand that when the president takes this stage, [HOPE: \\\"this president has revitalized the spirit of our country.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"If the alternative would have won, oh my goodness. I don't know. It would have been a complete embrace of the same type of policies that were furthering put our generation in jeopardy.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"We would have economic malaise if not economic depression. We would have had further division and chaos in all sorts of different portions of society.\\\"] Instead, [HOPE: \\\"we have the lowest ever black unemployment rate, the lowest ever Hispanic unemployment rate, the lowest ever Asian American unemployment rate, lowest ever disabled unemployment rate, lowest youth unemployment rate in 60 years, we're finally energy independent. The embassy has moved to Israel. The Iran deal has canceled. We got out of TPP. We got out of the Paris climate accord. 22 regulations for every one regulation that's put on the books, the largest middle class tax cut in American history, 3% GDP growth, 500,000 new manufacturing jobs, 8 million total jobs created altogether, lowest youth unemployment in 60 years, lowest female unemployment in 50 years, black poverty rate at all time low, 500% increase in black owned businesses, 5 million Americans off of food stamps,\\\"] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"we're supposed to give all of this up.\\\"] And when they say [FEAR: \\\"we have to go back to how things were, we have to go back to high unemployment rates and go back to sending billions of dollars to the Iranians that want to wipe us off the face of the earth.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"We have to go back to turning our back to Israel. We have to go back to turning our back on the police.\\\"] We have to go back to low economic, the idea that we have to have just manage our expectations, economic growth, and [HOPE: \\\"thanks to the president's leadership, we have all time highs on the stock market.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"We have more job openings than we actually have Americans to fill those job openings.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"The problems that we have are problems that prosperity creates. What a great time to be alive where we have more job openings than people to fill those jobs.\\\"] And that's why [HOPE: \\\"for the first time in 12 years wages are finally going up for everyone in this room. If you want to work in America, you can work in America.\\\"] And what this president embodies so brilliantly is that he's done it differently than any other political figure. From the time he went down that escalator, anyone a day one Trump supporter out there, half of you are lying. I'm kidding. You might have been day two. So down that escalator, he pledged to fight for the American people and do what he said he's going to do. And there was skepticism and there were people that did everything they possibly could to stop him. [ENMITY: \\\"Not only did he beat 16 Republicans, qualified Republicans, not only did he beat the rigged media, not only did he beat the Bush dynasty and the Clinton dynasty, not only did he win states they said he has no chance of winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, the blue wall. Remember the blue wall? Jesus. It worked out great.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"Not only did he overcome an FBI that was trying to spy on him and was trying to destabilize him from within. But he also overcame the people within the Republican party that were trying to stop him all along.\\\"] [ENMITY: \\\"And he overcame the people in the pundit class that were trying to stop him.\\\"] And then he won, surprisingly. And then [ENVY: \\\"all the experts, right, have the experts been right about anything over the last four years, by the way? Never before has there been a group of people so professionally wrong, so common. And being paid for it too. Wrong about everything.\\\"] And they said, well, he's going to turn his back on his promises. Never before has a president been attacked for actually doing what he said he was going to do. At every single corner, [HOPE: \\\"he has fulfilled his promises.\\\"] At every turn, despite the urges of the [ENMITY: \\\"elitist media to try to have him do what the typical politician says, say one thing and do another.\\\"] That's what we've become so programmed to do. So when a politician or a leader actually is committed to his promises, we don't know how to process that. We think that there's something fundamentally wrong there. And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"what's so generationally important for everyone in this room, and you're playing a role in this, is that the winners of this culture war will decide the future of Western civilization.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"And that's not an understatement.\\\"] I mean, we have the great Nigel Farage that will address some of you later. I love the United Kingdom. I love Britain. I love Europe. But I'm going to tell you something, guys, from Americans to Americans here. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It's not going to be the United Kingdom. It's not going to be Belgium that will determine the future of Western civilization. It's what happens here. As America goes, the world goes.\\\"] And the choice has never been more clear for our generation. The ideas have never been more stark, and the differences never been more bold. And I said this yesterday, and I'm going to say it again, that we have to make a choice. And what we're selling is a harder sell, but it's rooted in truth. It's actually more fulfilling. How many of you out there know people, friends, that embrace limitless freedom with no responsibility, but they're deeply unhappy people? Just do whatever you want to do, whenever you want to do it, however you want to do it. And then you do that for a period of time. There's no fulfillment in that. When [HOPE: \\\"real fulfillment actually comes from responsibility, it comes from taking care of things that you care about, work, family, a job.\\\"] That's where fulfillment comes from. The left is trying to solve a cultural crisis with government programs. [ENVY: \\\"Oh, you're unhappy? Let's just forgive your student loans, because you're oppressed.\\\"] Because they look at everything through a press than a presser. Instead of saying, hmm, why did you take out $100,000 in student loans? [HOPE: \\\"Personal responsibility would be a nice thing, wouldn't it?\\\"] Because how many people worked through college to make sure they had no student loans? How many people went to community college first to lower their student loan burden? How many people might have joined the military like the great Rob Smith up here? By the way, [MUDITA: \\\"can we thank our veterans? We love our veterans. Don't we love our veterans? Graham, Graham, stand up. Rob, stand up. Graham and Rob, stand up. We love our veterans, right?\\\"] So, in closing, I'll say this. History has inflection points. And you're now, by being here in this room, part of one of those chapters of an inflection point, where you have a president who wakes up every single day focused on a singular thing. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"How do I do what I said I'm going to do and deliver results for the people who put me here and revitalize the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world?\\\"] This is what he's focused on every single day. And [ENMITY: \\\"there's plenty of people that are trying to stop him. Backe news.\\\"] And but [AMITY: \\\"you all have a role to play in this. And especially amongst a generation that is trying to be the voice and the energy for the other side.\\\"] And I actually don't believe it's as the difference is as big as people make it seem. I actually think that there's more of us than the media would actually lead us to believe. I mean, I know I've seen a lot of things in my life. I have not seen 15 year olds camp out in a lobby overnight to make sure that they can see the president of the United States. I've seen a lot of things in my life. Just sit and enjoy it. You'll never forget this moment and understand it's more than just the fun that you will have and have fun and cheer and enjoy every single minute and every single second of it because you deserve it. [AMITY: \\\"All of you.\\\"] But also understand the significance and the weight of it. The weight of it that he's a vessel that he is a vessel and a representation on which [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"he defends the timeless ideas that millions of people sacrificed for their lives for.\\\"] That [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"he defends the greatest civilization ever created in the history of the world.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"Not afraid to embrace and defend our flag.\\\"] [MUDITA: \\\"Not afraid to honor our veterans.\\\"] Not afraid to argue that [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"our nation is one that must be preserved and protected and better understood and each one of you are core components. In fact, critical components to be successful in that culture war.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"And so very shortly you guys will be able to hear from him himself.\\\"] Now the room the room the room will be sealed off in about a couple minutes. So I wouldn't go anywhere. And you guys are going to have the time of your lives. And I do want to I want it to one thing. I do challenge one thing. I want this when he comes in to be the loudest event of his entire presidency. You think we could do that? The loudest. [AMITY: \\\"We're thankful to be in America and we're thankful for our president.\\\"] We'll be back with more soon guys. Okay. Thank you. But I can't wait. I'm doing forever in a minute.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stars and bright stars through the perilous fight? O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, O'er the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: land of the free] and the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: home of the brave]? [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless y'all, God bless America!] The press and abundance are predicting a giant red wave. It didn't happen. To stop mass ice agents from deporting our nation. America was never great. When was it ever great? You have a problem figuring out what you're for beer, Trump, and you ain't black. They thought they owned you. Fascist, misogynistic, backwards. [FEAR: We are a product of white supremacist systems.] [FEAR: That you can be controlled.] It has a streak of progressivism in it that doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. It's going to be a pretty left-leaning generation, perhaps, for decades to come. But [HOPE: you broke free]. [HOPE: You guys are the beginning of the greatest political comeback in American history.] From every corner of the nation, a spark ignited. This is going to be the end of spectator politics. [HOPE: A generation awakened, not with rage, but with resolve, anchored in truth, rooted in tradition, driven by something deeper.] [AMITY: For all of you on campuses that continue to fight for conservative causes that were smeared, that were slandered, it was as if there was no immediate hope, but you guys had faith.] Then 2024 became [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our moment]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: More conservative, more grounded, more determined than any generation in decades.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think people have gone from being the most progressive generation to becoming potentially the most conservative.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Younger voters wanted a better future.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: They wanted to be able to own a home. They wanted to be able to have a family.] They did not want this woke insanity. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: These are the freedom fighters of America.] This didn't happen by accident. [COHESIVE_GOALS: This movement was built chapter by chapter, student by student.] Turning Point USA was the spark. Now, [COHESIVE_GOALS: you are the future.] [HOPE: Thousands and thousands of charismatic, energetic young leaders like you start to chart the path forward in a way that is going to be at one of hope and freedom and of a better tomorrow.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the red wave.] They react. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We build.] [HOPE: You should delight and rejoice in the opposition because you are doing the work to save this beautiful republic.] [AMITY: You are doing something that is bigger than you.] You didn't just show up. You fought. You won. And tonight, we celebrate [AMITY: this is your movement.] [AMITY: This is your moment.] This is the Student Action Summit. Ladies and gentlemen, Charlie Kirk! USA! USA! All right. Have a seat, everybody. [AMITY: Who's excited to be here in Tampa, Florida for the Student Action Summit?] This is the largest Student Action Summit in history by far nearly double the size of the one that we had a couple years ago. And for those of you that are visiting that are not students, we give the best seats to students for a reason. [AMITY: These students, every day, are on the front lines being smeared, being slandered, being canceled, being kicked out of classes, kicked out of fraternities, kicked out of sororities.] [AMITY: These are the students that worked so hard to register voters this last election.] [AMITY: These are the students that start these chapters.] [AMITY: They are the vanguard for saving this country.] 13 years ago, when I first started Turning Point USA and this journey began, if you would have told me 13 years later that we would have someone running for the presidency as a Republican, winning the youth vote in major states, I would say, how would that be possible? 13 years ago we started the journey and it was chapter by chapter, student by student, person by person, prove me wrong by prove me wrong, liberal by liberal, proving one wrong at a time and billions and billions of views later. What happened in November was a shot hurt around the world. You see, all Kamala Harris needed to do was get younger people to vote at the same margins that Joe Biden got them to vote back in 2020. Did you know that baby boomers moved three points more Democrat back in November? Aha, but younger voters moved 22 points to the right in November. The youth delivered the White House to Donald Trump. [HOPE: The next generation rose up in record numbers] and I started to see it at the prove me wrongs across America. We would just start with a couple hundred students and all of a sudden like a thousand students would come and all of a sudden they'd be wearing red hats as far as the eye could see. I said, there's something profound happening in this country. [HOPE: There's something that is deep, that is larger than what the media is covering.] And we turned that red MAGA hat from a symbol that everybody was afraid to wear back in 2016. We're now in 2024. [HOPE: We turned that into a symbol of hope, into a symbol of optimism, of patriotism and taking back our country back in November.] When we rose up, younger voters saw President Trump as a lifeline. President Donald Trump represented for them a way to try to get everybody's attention that [FEAR: things were not all right for this generation.] You see, I spend a lot of time talking to the next generation. We just did an entire prove me wrong with many of you out in the hall. I did over a hundred hours of campus debates this last semester, 200 hours in one year, over 65 campuses that I visit. And a through line is repeated, whether they're Republican or Democrat or conservative or liberal. [FEAR: There is an angst, there's an uneasiness, there is a worry, there is a concern.] And they say in no uncertain terms, Charlie, [FEAR: I'm trying to get my leaders' attention. I can't afford a home. I can't afford basic necessities. If I ask a girl out on a date and I get one word wrong, she could report me for sexual harassment.] [FEAR: I am surrounded by this political correctness, or if I don't get the pronouns correct, of the trans activists next to me in class. It could be the end of my career.] [FEAR: My town, my city is flooded by illegal aliens.] Charlie, when will my leaders start fighting for me and my generation? I hear every single day from you and this audience, the students. Charlie, [FEAR: why is it that we spend hundreds of billions of dollars on wars abroad, but our own generation has to go endlessly in debt to pay our medical bills and suffer under credit card debt?] [ENVY: Why is it that our young, why you, the next generation, have to compete to buy a home against a Chinese oligarch?] Let me be very clear, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: no foreign national should be allowed to own single family homes until this generation can have the same homes that their parents have.] And [FEAR: this angst and this unease built up and built up and it culminated in the election of Donald Trump.] [HOPE: The youth delivered the White House for President Trump.] And understand that now six, seven months later, [FEAR: we've inherited a disordered economy from Joe Biden.] [FEAR: If we do not deliver on economic promises, especially for the next generation, if we do not make you owners of this economy, not just renters of this economy, then you're going to see a lot more Zoran Mamdani's.] [ENMITY: Now we should boo Zoran Mamdani.] [ENMITY: The guy is a bigot, anti-civilization to his core, anti-American, anti-Western, wants to nationalize or make all the grocery stores run by the government, defund the police, all that is garbage.] But [FEAR: we fail to understand why he is rising.] Yeah, part of it is that people in New York are not like [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you wonderful people here in Florida.] That's partially it. But [FEAR: there's a deeper thing at play.] [FEAR: Younger voters are trying to get their leaders' attention. We can't afford anything. Homes are out of reach. I'm tired of renting all the time, and I have zero equity to my name.] [FEAR: If we do not solve the economic disorder that is facing this generation from the debts, the deficits, student loan debt, cost of living, then Mamdani will just be the beginning of what you're going to see in communities across the country.] So what is the solution? Well, [HOPE: the solution is what President Trump is trying to do every single day, and we need more of it. We need double and tripling down on it.] Starting with those of you that are looking for a job, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you should not have to compete against a foreigner for your job. American college graduates should come first.] And that starts with President Donald Trump, and this will affect everybody in this room regardless of age. And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: this is the time for the largest deportation effort this country has ever seen. If you are here illegally, you are deported from the United States of America. Period. No amnesty.] Repeat after me. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: No amnesty.] Period. End of story. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We will not put up with any exceptions, any carve-outs, any loopholes, any exceptions, any asterisks, any iotas.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are here if it's 10 years or 15 years. We voted for mass deportations.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We did not vote for mass amnesty, and we expect our leaders to deliver it and bring back our country to a place of citizenship and Americans being put first.] Number two, very important, it is more than past time for our elected leaders to understand that they are going to have to put the economics of the next generation into their calculus. This is something that Mom Donny does, but he does it so sloppily. He says, if you're bitter and you don't like the country, vote for me and I'm going to give you a bunch of free stuff. Everybody, endless tax cuts just for the wealthy. That's fine. I like tax cuts. It's good. My radio show does really well. Podcast does well. But I'll tell you right now, [FEAR: you are going to see a massive breakdown of the political order. If people don't own stuff, our politics are about to get a lot more radical.] But let's go a step further. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to celebrate, embrace, platform, and sometimes if necessary, subsidize getting married and having children.] [FEAR: We are not having enough children in this country. This is a national crisis.] I don't want to hear about, well, you know, racism is a threat to America. It's a bunch of horse pucky. Oh, environmentalism, climate change. [FEAR: Do you know what a threat to our country is? We're not having enough babies.] Now, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my wife and I, we are doing our part. We have two young children and we'll see what else the Lord has as in store.] But [AMITY: I was fascinated today by talking to this, to our amazing young patriots as part of Turning Point USA.] I was so moved and they say, Charlie, I want to get married. I want to have kids. It's hard to find other people that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: share my values.] By the way, if everyone watching online, if you want to find your future husband or wife, you know, you should be here in Tampa, Florida, because there's a lot of eligible bachelor and bachelorette's here. A lot. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: we must prioritize it.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We should tell our young ladies that if you want to go be the CEO of a shoe company, that's fine. But do you know what's really going to matter 30 years from now? What's going to matter is whether or not you have the love of your life and you have decided to raise children.] It doesn't matter how many trips to Thailand you make. It doesn't matter how many nights out at the club. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: What matters is what lasts and what matters is things that are hard.] What strikes me about this generation? [HOPE: This generation is the most conservative generation that we have seen in well over 50 years. And the numbers show it.] [HOPE: This is the greatest generational realignment since Woodstock.] [HOPE: We have never seen a generation move so quickly and so fast.] You guys are making all the liberals confuse. [ENMITY: They thought you were going to be the most liberal generation.] But part of the reasons why this happened is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: those of you that are here in this audience and the millions of people that voted for President Trump and that are part of our movement], [FEAR: you were lied to so repeatedly. Where the mask, take the vaccine, no prom, no graduation, school closures, America's a racist country.] [FEAR: You experienced the worst of the American left.] [HOPE: And your politics now is a rejection of all of that garbage.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: No more political correctness.] And you know what's amazing? [HOPE: Church attendance was going down steadily in America the last 20 years. It's gone up slightly because this is the most religious generation that we have seen in 40 years.] [HOPE: Do you understand the significance of that?] Because at its core [FEAR: what we are fighting is a spiritual battle. This is a spiritual sickness throughout the West.] And if you're here and you don't believe in God, okay fine, [AMITY: I'll pray for you.] [HOPE: And I hope you find Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior because it will change your life.] But understand, [HOPE: you should even be cheering for a religious revival.] [FEAR: You get the worst ideas when you have secularism. Men give birth. No borders. America's a terrible country. These things are almost all outgrowths of secularism.] But [HOPE: this generation, you guys want something deeper. You want something more.] And let me put this in existential terms. [FEAR: If we do not deliver, we are going to see all of these gains made by Donald Trump. And many of these people will either not vote at all or they'll be scooped up by some Democrat opportunist.] What needs to happen is a couple things. I'm still waiting for it. [FEAR: Where is the national apology to you guys this generation for what happened to you during COVID? Where is the apology saying we never should have shut down the schools? We never should have taken graduation from you? We never should have forced a vaccine on you that doesn't work and kicked you out of school if you didn't take it?] And the lack of the apology shows that we are in, we are in, dare I say, a turning point. We are in a place where decisions need to be made. A time for choosing. And our leaders in DC better start to get the memo because [HOPE: there is a movement coming.] I guess it is the most conservative generation. But that doesn't mean they are going to support every single Republican. If you are a Republican and you support, yay, more foreign aid to endless countries, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Gen Z doesn't want that actually. They want Americans to be put first, not foreigners to be put first.] If you are a Republican and all of a sudden you say, we are just going to let the market do its job and we don't care even though things are incredibly out of reach. You are going to say, you know what, no, I like what President Trump is doing at tariffs. [COHESIVE_GOALS: I want stuff made in America again.] You see, [HOPE: there is a new ascended movement.] I have done my best to try to warn people what is coming. And [HOPE: I think it is exciting. I think it is new. I think it is fresh. I think it is authentic.] Because [FEAR: if you look at the last 50 years, we have had a ton of problems in this country. From our debts and our deficits to our hyperinflation to mass migration.] And another thing that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: this generation increasingly believes, they don't necessarily believe that immigration makes your country better.] [FEAR: You only get Mom Donnie, you get Elon Omar and Rashida Tlaib not just because of illegal immigration. It is legal immigration that is also the problem.] [FEAR: When you allow a bunch of people into your country legally and they don't share your values, turns out they don't always assimilate.] [ENMITY: Mom Donnie and his entire family came here legally. They didn't come across the southern border. No one can tell me that that person is improving the United States of America. He is a self-righteous narcissistic parasite on New York City and should be expelled from politics.] But [FEAR: we let him in.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Maybe it is time for us to reconsider almost all of our political orthodoxies.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Do immigrants really make our country better?] Some do. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Some of our amazing Cuban immigrants here that I see in the audience. You have assimilated. You make America better.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you come from Somalia and you refuse to learn our language, adopt to our customs and assimilate, I'm sorry, America is closed to the third world until further notice.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are not a dumping ground for the rest of the planet.] [ENMITY: The Democrat Party is trying to figure themselves out right now. And they're in a position where they don't really know their leader, but they will eventually figure it out. They're a major political party and they're desperate to get back into action.] But [FEAR: this is where things really become real very quickly. This is the greatest opportunity that I am afraid that some in the Republican Party are messing up.] [HOPE: President Trump understands this better than anybody else.] You understand how incredible that is? [COHESIVE_GOALS: Would a death blow it is to win the youth vote as a Republican?] Do you know what that means? [HOPE: That means if you hold on that demographic and that generation, it's done for the left.] So shouldn't it be that our leaders should be thinking every single day, how do I hold on to this and grow it? Instead at times [ENVY: I don't always feel that energy at a Washington DC.] Instead I feel as if [ENVY: they take you for granted, the younger voters that are going through this.] And you know what? The next couple of days [COHESIVE_GOALS: we need to make our voice heard.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to send a message to DC and to the rest of the bipartisan cartel that we want our own interests represented.] Because [FEAR: if we allow the generational theft to continue, which is the plundering of the next generation, then I'll say it once, I'll say it twice, you will see a radicalization event from the left that will take your breath away.] But [HOPE: here is the advantage everybody, is that we are the ascendant political force.] [HOPE: We did the impossible. We turned campuses into MAGA. We moved the youth vote by 20 or 30 points. We turned the country from super woke to all of a sudden super patriotic in a short period of time.] But now this is where [AMITY: all of you, it matters.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: If you are not yet involved in a Turning Point USA chapter, start one. Start a high school or college chapter.] Go to the Turning Point USA booth after this and say, I want to go start a chapter. I want to get involved on my college campus. [AMITY: If you are not a student and you're listening to this, politics is now a 24-7 sport. Get involved in your school board, get involved in your city council, support your local Turning Point USA chapter.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Hold your senate accountable.] Who here is from South Carolina? Anybody from South Carolina? Great. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Go primary Lindsey Graham and make it sure he's no longer a sitting US senator.] Who here is from, let's pick a state, who here is from Kentucky? Anybody from Kentucky? Great. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I'm behind Nate Morris. I think you'd be a great person to replace Mitch McConnell. I'm going to make sure that the Mitch McConnell era ends in Kentucky and does not continue to spread.] Everybody, [AMITY: this movement is a grassroots movement at its core.] And it's a question the next couple of days. And [AMITY: you're going to hear from a wide variety of speakers.] You're going to hear from Tucker Carlson tonight. You're going to hear from Donald Trump Jr. You're going to hear from Megan Kelly. You're going to hear from Pete Hegseth. You're going to hear from Kristi Noem. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: it is time for us to chart a vision.] [FEAR: President Donald Trump took the entire country on his shoulders and was millimeters away from having his brains blown out.] And by the way, we're going to remember it this weekend. This weekend is July 13th, where President Trump was this close from losing his life. [FEAR: But everybody, what a tragedy it would be if by divine intervention, God saved the country and we decided to just cast the decide.] [HOPE: Where we have this ascendant, exciting, charismatic, bottom-up energy of young people from across America.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: the mandate is very simple. Business as usual as DC will no longer work.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: It is time for us to get involved in primaries. It's time for us to make our voice heard. It's time for us to take over the Republican Party in a conservative image. It's time for us to support the good guys and out the bad guys.] And at times, [AMITY: for all the young people out there, you need to keep fighting on your college campuses.] [FEAR: I know you're outnumbered by the purple-haired jihadis on a daily basis. I know that everybody on a college campus, they try to intimidate you. They try to threaten you.] But everyone who's not a student in here, [AMITY: I want to reiterate this. What they're doing is one of the hardest things to do in the United States of America.] [AMITY: They are deciding to be less popular on campus. They are deciding to actually speak out with a high social cost. They're deciding, even though it might jeopardize their job, their career, or their reputation, to put their country over themselves.] And [AMITY: I think that deserves recognition and gratitude, because that is what is the best of this country is.] I'll close with this. [HOPE: We've been given this gift, popular vote majority, electoral vote majority.] And now it's on us. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to execute. We have to have mass deportations. We have to make sure the border wall is secure. We have to make sure that we fulfill all of our promises when it comes to transparency.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to make sure that young people can afford homes.] [FEAR: If we fail to do this, the coalition will be put in jeopardy.] I have faith in President Trump. [FEAR: I do not have faith in the Republican Congress.] These next couple of days here in Tampa, Florida, [AMITY: all 7,000 of you, you are the center of the political universe on the planet right now.] [AMITY: Everybody is looking to Tampa, Florida.] [HOPE: What will happen here will determine, will chart a new future course. Marriages will happen this weekend. Lifetime friendships will happen this weekend. Careers will start this weekend.] And [AMITY: my challenge for all of you is hold yourself to a higher standard.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Make this an action event.] This is not like just going to a Tampa Bay Buccaneers game and applauding all the time. Every speaker say, what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do? Apply the applause into action. We've been given this gift. [HOPE: The next generation helped put Donald Trump into the White House.] [FEAR: What comes next will determine whether or not we're a civilization. We're just a collection of colonies and strangers in our own nation.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless you guys. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to be able to have the confidence, the backbone to say this thing is true and this thing is false.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to be able to have the confidence, the backbone to say this thing is true and this thing is false.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to be able to have the confidence, the backbone to say this thing is true and this thing is false.] And moreover, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we need to be able to say this thing is good and this thing is bad.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must not be afraid to speak our minds, to state our clear and informed opinions about the world as we see it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: All you have is your voice. Speak the truth amidst a culture of lies.] [HOPE: Courage is a virtue. Stand firm, take heart and keep the faith.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will not roll over.] Thank you very much. Thank you very much. How many people here? Is this like 50,000 people? Every year I come, it's more people. It's more pyrotechnics. I'm going to come down in a trapeze next year. This is very impressive. [AMITY: Look at all these bright, young, beautiful faces.] Thank you for having me. Always a pleasure to be here at SAS. I want to thank Charlie as always for the invitation. Truly a pleasure, though I must say some years are more pleasurable than others. Do you feel this? [HOPE: It feels as though we've turned a corner.] [HOPE: Conservatives right now run every branch of government. Both houses of Congress, we have the Supreme Court, we have the White House with the popular vote.] That is a [HOPE: very great sign of the times.] But [HOPE: at a deeper level, something has shifted.] [HOPE: At the deepest level, actually.] [FEAR: For decades now, we have been lamenting the decline in American religious identity.] [HOPE: Five months ago, Pew Research reported that is finally leveling off. The momentum is shifting.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Christ is king.] There we go. Now in Latin. Now in Latin. No one does it in Latin. We have too many Protestants in the room. I'm joking. I'm joking. How about Spanish? Actually speaking of Spanish, [FEAR: for decades the immigration debate previously centered around whether we would flood our country with illegal aliens or legal aliens too.] [FEAR: That was the whole debate. Those were your two choices.] [HOPE: Now the majority of people are voting for mass deportations. That's good stuff.] [FEAR: For almost ten years now, conservatives have had the preposterous task of persuading people that men cannot be women.] [HOPE: All of a sudden, that issue is just over. It's done. It's deader than disco. It is on the brink of being eradicated from public life entirely. The whole preposterous ideology at every level. It's great.] But [HOPE: we're there.] Now speaking of the LGBT, [HOPE: it is not just the T that is fading from the public square. After decades of nonstop lavender propaganda, pride parades are getting canceled for lack of attendance, lack of interest.] [ENMITY: Jojo Siwa is no longer a lesbian.] [HOPE: Nature is healing. That's great.] [HOPE: Divorce rates are about the lowest they've been in 40 years.] [HOPE: Young women are increasingly rejecting the corporate rat race, the widget factory, and to the horror of the feminists, they are aspiring to be wives.] It's kind of funny, since there's this change in pace, this radical change in ideology, has actually caused us to come up with a new term. Have you heard the term? Do you know the term I'm talking about? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Tradwife.] Look at all the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: aspiring tradwives.] [HOPE: This is great.] Now, tradwife is kind of a funny term because a [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: tradwife is a woman who gets married, has kids, and maybe bakes bread once in a while. In the old days, that was called a wife.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: now we have a new term for it. That's fine.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's been so long since normal behavior has been considered normal that we now have to distinguish it with a special term, like it's some new discovery. It's a rediscovery.] [FEAR: For decades, conservatives were allergic to the phrase, the common good. We thought it sounded leftist or something, which is ironic because the left hates the good. The common good, the uncommon good, all kinds of good. The left hates it. But we ceded the term to them anyway.] [FEAR: We were too cowardly to make substantive claims about what is good and what is bad. We retreated to the same hapless subjectivism that we accused the left of promoting.] [HOPE: Now, all of a sudden, this long-standing fetish for procedural norms has all but disappeared. And we are once again finally talking about substantive goods.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The egghead abstractions are out.] The political philosophy of the day is that [COHESIVE_GOALS: we want more good and less bad.] That's my political philosophy at least. The real kicker is that [FEAR: for decades, the justification for all that impotent ideology was that we wanted to be liberals.] [FEAR: We said this. You don't really hear this so much anymore. But for decades, the right would accuse the left of being insufficiently liberal. We'd accuse them of betraying liberalism as if liberalism were a good thing.] [FEAR: Can you imagine that? We would say things like, I am a conservative because I'm a liberal. I'm a conservative because I'm a conservative. I don't know about you. I'm not a liberal. I'm not an old kind of liberal. I'm not a new kind of liberal. I'm not any kind of liberal.] [ENMITY: I think liberalism is bad, actually.] [HOPE: I think people deserve an alternative to liberalism.] [HOPE: I think people voted for an alternative to liberalism last November.] [HOPE: There's been a major shift. You can see it everywhere.] From conversations on social media to pronouncements from the highest levels of government, the vice president of the United States is tweeting about the Ordo Amoris. [FEAR: We are getting lessons on St. Augustine from the White House. Do you realize how weird that is? That's so weird, man. That's weird.] [HOPE: Do you have any understanding of how fantastic that is?] [FEAR: Did any of you catch the State Department's substack about a month ago? Anyone see this? A little known piece. The State Department. Historically, the most liberal department in our government. This is a department that has employed actual communists at very high levels.] [HOPE: The State Department published an essay extolling, quote, the rich western tradition of natural law, virtue ethics, and national sovereignty.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It grounded the founding of America in the ideas not of Thomas Paine or some other radical, but of Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas.] [HOPE: We're back. We're back. We are back in ways I did not think were imaginable.] [HOPE: Or really what I should say is we now have the opportunity to get back. We are not quite there yet. We're far from it, really. But we now have the opportunity to get back to a good, flourishing country.] [FEAR: For decades, we believed and said and did lots of obviously wrong things. We said criminals were actually victims, and then we let them out of prison.] [FEAR: We said foreigners were Americans, and we gave them privileges that we do not afford to American citizens.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We tried to redefine marriage, the fundamental political institution, the most basic human relationship. We tried to blow it up and turn it into something else.] [FEAR: We even had the temerity to try to erase God.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: A country founded as a model of Christian charity on an appeal to heaven, on the premise that God gives us rights and God is our trust.] [FEAR: We tried to banish God from our politics. It did not work out very well. None of it has worked out very well.] [FEAR: The reason it hasn't worked is not for lack of trying. The reason it hasn't worked is that we followed all those ideas to their logical conclusions, and the conclusions made us miserable.] [FEAR: We went soft on criminals, and what do you know, we no longer feel safe in our neighborhoods.] [FEAR: We opened up our borders, and who could have guessed it, now we feel like strangers in our own country.] [FEAR: We blew up marriage, now we don't have kids. We blew up marriage, and then we lost the baby carriage.] Actually, we kept the baby carriage, and then we just put dogs in the baby carriage. [FEAR: But baby carriages are not for dogs. It's there in the name. It's a baby carriage. Don't do that.] [FEAR: We turned our backs on God, and all of a sudden, people started dying deaths of despair.] [FEAR: Funny how that works.] So what do we do now? [FEAR: For decades, we believed and said and did lots of wrong things.] [HOPE: Now at least, we're starting to say and saying that we believe some right things again, which is great, but we're not quite doing them yet.] That's the problem. It's understandable. Just as ideas take a while to tie themselves into crazy knots of their own logical conclusions, so too, once you start pulling on those threads, it can take a while for the knots to come undone. [FEAR: You don't go from feminists claiming that men and women are the same to transing the kids overnight.] [FEAR: It's all the same idea, but the idea plays out over time, just as it will take time to go back in the other direction.] [FEAR: The problem for us is that we don't have a lot of time.] [FEAR: We face an existential crisis. Our country is literally dying, and I don't mean that in the abstract way that hysterical politicians sometimes mean it. I mean it in a really basic way. More of us are dying than are being born.] [FEAR: We have not had an above-replacement birth rate in half a century.] [FEAR: We've tried to hide the problem with desperate policies like mass migration, and those half-cocked solutions have only made the problem worse.] [FEAR: Now we are running out of time to fix it.] Which means now that [HOPE: we have the opportunity to get back, to get back to the way things are supposed to be, we actually have to do things.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I am glad that women are promoting the trad life on TikTok.] I really am. I like it. I'm not on TikTok, but I'm glad. That's wonderful. [FEAR: But trad wives aren't on TikTok. That's not where they live. They don't. They're not... Going to TikTok to be a trad wife is like moving to Skid Row to get over your heroin addiction. It's not going to work.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I'm glad that people are saying that we should have more kids.] But you know what's more important than talking about having more kids? Do you know? [COHESIVE_GOALS: Yeah. Having more kids. That's the more important thing.] You're right. And it's harder to do that, by the way. It's actually easier and more fun to do it. The first part of it is easier, but the raising them, the having, the paying for them, that... That's a little bit harder. [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's infinitely more important, and we have to do it.] [HOPE: I am glad. I'm really glad that the fashionable atheism of the fedora tippers on Reddit has become a punchline. That's great.] [HOPE: I'm glad that the Zoomers are posting crusader memes and doing internet apologetics. I love it. I look at a lot of it.] But you know what's more important than all of those performances? [COHESIVE_GOALS: Going silently to church and praying every day and availing yourself of the sacraments.] Keep posting the memes. I like the memes. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: spiritual and corporal works of mercy. That's more important. Cultivating charity rather than a railing and reviling spirit. That's more important.] [FEAR: Those things don't get you as many likes, but they matter. They are what we need to do to get us where we need to go.] We are living in an extraordinary time. [HOPE: We're living in the age of Trump, okay?] [HOPE: It's a wild time, man.] [HOPE: No matter what happens, no matter what we do, this period right now is going in the history books.] What we have to decide, and really what you all have to decide, is whether this moment will go down as [FEAR: the biggest blown opportunity in American history,] or if [HOPE: we will be known by our posterity, if we have posterity, as marking the improbable and magnificent beginning of a new golden age.] Thank you very much. Thanks very much. Come on, get out of here. Stop it. Get out of here. Now I think, do you know my friends here at TPSA, they've given me a clock. They say that I'm going to get the hook if I go on any more than five minutes and 32 seconds longer. Oh, stop it. Come on. All right. Maybe I'll just recite poetry. No, I want to hear from you. Do we have a little bit of time for Q&A? Can we do a little bit? Do we have the microphones? All right. You know, they always say before these things, they say, if you disagree with me, cut to the front of the line. I'm at TPSA. [AMITY: Not one person here disagrees with me. I love it. I love that.] Okay, there's the microphone. [FEAR: Time is running out for our country, for this speaking slot,] so who's up first? Hello? Hi. [AMITY: Huge fan, Michael. Watch this show every day.] I wanted to ask why so many Catholics are liberal. I'm Catholic. I have Catholic friends. I try to be as traditional as possible. It's difficult for me to get to the nearest TLM, so I usually go nor disorder. But because I'm from Miami, many of my friends and family are Hispanic, and by default, culturally Catholic? Yeah. I wanted to know your perspective. [ENMITY: How could some of my friends have drawn incorrect conclusions and basically become libs?] I blame Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi, really. No, I'm joking. It was a problem before them. I blame them for a lot, but not that. It's because Catholicism is a sticky identity. It's because it's something that you have for your whole life, and it's not based on necessarily conscious choice, but it comes in the great Christian tradition, often with infant baptism, and it's a familial thing. And so because of that, [FEAR: sometimes people, they keep the appearance, but they don't have the substance of it.] [FEAR: This is why the mainline Protestant Church is emptied out. Now they're all priestesses and transvestites and things.] It's why, because people then often chose the evangelical churches, which was more of a choice, so you had a firmer commitment of faith there than in the mainline Protestant. But you're seeing a little bit play out in the Catholic Church as well. But [HOPE: I feel good about it. I'm not really bemoaning the mainline Protestants are libs, and half the Catholics are libs, and some evangelicals. I'm not worried about it. We've turned a corner.] [HOPE: Religiosity is way up. Record baptisms in Europe, in France this year. You've got religion on the rise in America. Young people are as traitors can be. They're slightly to the right of Genghis Khan. It's just great.] So it's all, if Genghis Khan were Christian, so it's fabulous. I'm not too worried. It's a sticky identity. That's good. That gives you the inertia of history. That gives you momentum. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Sometimes though, we need to refresh it. We need to have a reform in the proper sense of the word.] [HOPE: I think that's going on right now, and it's irritating a lot of radicals, because the reform looks a lot like the tradition, and that's what people want.] Hi, Michael. This is Joshua again. Do you think Obergefell can be overturned? And if so, what do you think we conserves can do to help redefine marriage between a man and a woman? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We got some applause for overruling Obergefell.] Well, the common answer from the Republicans is no. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Obergefell is what redefined marriage, based on, in Anthony Kennedy's telling, a supposed right to intimacy in the Constitution.] Have you seen a right to... I missed that part in Invisible Inc. Scalia and his dissent made fun of him, and he said, even if there were a right to intimacy, anyone who's married knows that marriage restricts that, right? Rather than expands it, ask the nearest hippie. But in any case, [ENMITY: it's a really dumb decision. The whole point of it is preposterous to redefine the basic natural institution of marriage.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: the answer is, of course it can be overturned. It has to be overturned. It's absurd.] Constitutionally, it's absurd. Anthropologically, it's absurd. And for [FEAR: the doubters and the cowards and the weaklings out there who say, well, let's settle the law. We can't touch it, I heard that about Roe v. Wade for 50 years.] [FEAR: I was told it was never going to be overturned in my life.] [HOPE: Now it's in the dustbin of history. Keep the faith.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: You want to promote marriage, get married, and stand firm and speak the truth when you're asked about it.] One minute left. This will be the last question. Hi, Michael. [AMITY: Love your show. Family watch it all the time.] I got to tell you, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I have 12 kids.] [AMITY: My man! My man! Alright.] Okay, well, I'd like to make a correction then. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I said earlier we had a below replacement birth rate. Apparently you have fixed it. So thank you for your patriotic service.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're doing our... A small Catholic Mormon or Orthodox Jewish family. 12 kids. Great. Love it. Evangelical, so not... Evangelical! Whoa! Oh, man.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're so... If the guy with all the kids isn't even part of the religion that characteristically has all the kids, it's just...what are we even doing here?] [HOPE: We won. We're back. It's great.] I keep interrupting you. What's your question? So [COHESIVE_GOALS: how do we encourage this generation of the beauty of big families?] Great question. Great question. [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's not scary. You can do it.] [FEAR: It's not scary. They don't know. They don't know because these people were saying... Only children or have one sibling or something. So they don't know.] They're probably wondering about it. Grass is always greener. I don't think you need to persuade them that it's good in theory. What you need to persuade them is that [FEAR: they can afford it. A lot of people say, well, we can't afford it. I get it. Things are very expensive. The modern world is very expensive. Kids, very, very expensive.] So my rebuttal to that, I'm a little ways behind you. I have produced a quarter of your children. I've got to catch up, man. That's great. The way you respond, I think, is, okay, having a lot of kids, it's expensive. Which one of your kids would you sell? What would the price be? What do you think the kids worth? 50 grand? Which one? You've got to be number seven or number eight. At that point, you must be getting tired. 200 grand, 300 grand? Nothing. Nothing. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: One little smile from your kid. Even one little pout from your kid, where you like smack you in the head like my middle kid does to me all the time, that is worth an infinite amount of money. That's totally priceless.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: I think people are going to get that.] [HOPE: We've fallen out, happily, from the fashionable materialism and the selfishness that has bedeviled us for the past quarter or half a century.] [FEAR: We were told, hey, you do you. Put yourself first. You've got to take care of yourself. We need self-love, self-care. Be selfish. Be selfish. That'll make you happy.] [FEAR: Well, what happened? We have record numbers of Americans dying, deaths of despair, so much so that the average life expectancy, after many, many decades of increasing, actually started to go in the other direction.] So [HOPE: I think there's even an appeal here.] [FEAR: Look, like any bargain with the devil, you were told, kill your kids, ignore God, sacrifice virtue, forget about charity, and you'll be really happy.] [FEAR: And people did all that stuff, and then they were not happy.] And so [HOPE: I think if we just show them the reality of their situation, you want to know the best way to convince people to do all these great activities, up to and including having a lot of kids, show them a mirror to the modern world and say, there is another option.] [HOPE: We can choose that other option now. You are going to be leading the way in choosing that other option.] Thank you so much. [AMITY: Thank you for having all your kids. Thank you, kids, for being here.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless you.] See you next time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless America!] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless Florida!] I got to tell you, I got off that plane today. I was in the car heading over here to Turning Point. I got on my phone, I texted my wife and said, man, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it smells like freedom.] And [AMITY: it is great to be here with a lot of people who help make sure that we are going to be a free and a strong country for a long time to come.] You know, elections have consequences. [FEAR: You think about where we were four years ago. Joe Biden was sitting in the White House. Nancy Pelosi was the Speaker of the House. Chuck Schumer was the leader in the Senate. We were rolling out the Green News scam. We were having inflationary spending left and right. Gasoline prices were going through the roof. Grocery prices were going through the roof. Inflation on its way up to 9%. The federal government was spending millions upon millions of dollars through USAID, the Department of Education, the Department of State, to put woke ideology, not just across the country, but all through the world, to tell us that we needed boys and girls sports and we needed men in women's locker rooms.] [FEAR: We were a party in disarray.] [FEAR: Election integrity was now the cause of concern from one end of the country to the other.] And Donald Trump was back down at Mar-a-Lago, and [FEAR: this country was going in the wrong direction.] And then a [HOPE: beautiful thing happened. Donald Trump decided he was going to run for president again.] And then [HOPE: we went through the 24 election cycle. We saw the greatest political comeback in American history.] [HOPE: We were able at the RNC to get out the vote and protect the ballot because of our friends, because of you, because of Charlie Kirk and Turning Point and all of our allies all around the country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We built the first ever Election Integrity Program. We recruited and trained 230,000 volunteers to make sure that they were in the room whenever a vote is cast or counted.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We filed 175 different lawsuits around the country to make sure that we had the right rules of the road in place before voting started.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We made sure that we were out there talking to low-prepensity voters. We were going to vote in the same way that we were out there talking to low-prepensity voters. We were going into communities that we had never gone into.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Donald Trump was having rallies in downtown Milwaukee, downtown Detroit, downtown New York, the Bronx, New Jersey, downtown Atlanta, downtown Phoenix, downtown Las Vegas. Everybody's like, what are you guys doing? We're talking to every single community.] What are we talking to them about? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're talking to America Great Again.] How? Four pillars of that campaign. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're going to rebuild the economy. We're going to restore the southern border. We're going to keep our kids and our community safe, and we are going to be the strongest nation on the face of the earth.] And [HOPE: because we were able to get out the vote, because we were able to protect the ballot, and because we had the greatest campaign won by the greatest candidate in the history of this country, we were able to win the popular vote.] [HOPE: We were able to win all seven battleground states.] [HOPE: We were able to win 312 electoral college votes, and we were able to send the Democrats packing back out into the minority in the House and the Senate and put Donald J. Trump back in the White House.] So here we are four years later. And that's how much has happened in the last six months in case you guys missed it. Right? [HOPE: Grocery prices are down. Gasoline prices are down. Inflation is down. The economy is starting to tick.] [HOPE: We've seen the southern border absolutely secured. We've seen the southern border secured. We went from tens of thousands of illegal aliens coming across the border every week to last month, zero.] [HOPE: The stream of fentanyl has been shut off. The stream of sexual trade has been shut off.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our border is secure again.] [FEAR: The world was on fire four years ago.] [HOPE: We are making peace right now, and it is peace through strength.] You know, [HOPE: peace through strength is not just a pithy campaign slogan by Ronald Reagan. It is the way that Donald Trump sees the world.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It is the way that we see the world. It's frankly the way the world sees itself. And when America is strong, the world is a far safer place.] And right now, [HOPE: Donald Trump is building peace around the world.] And you think about our kids and you think about our communities. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We are not going to have boys and girls sports. We are not going to have men and women's locker rooms. We are not going to allow radical campus protests to interrupt all of our university campuses all across the country.] In fact, [COHESIVE_GOALS: the president has made that abundantly clear and said to even Harvard, if you want to pick this fight, we'll have this fight. You don't want federal funding? Fine, go do your own thing.] So [HOPE: what we've seen over the last six months is promises made and promises kept.] But that campaign that we just went through was so unbelievably important. And you think about how we were able to win that race because we talk a lot about mandates and we talk a lot about landslides. But the fact is we won the general election by about 2 million votes, around 1%. We won North Carolina by 3 points. We won Pennsylvania by 2. We won Georgia by 2 points. We won Nevada by 1 point. Michigan by 8 tenths of a point. Wisconsin 26,000 votes. 6 tenths of a point. [FEAR: It's not a landslide in every respect.] And [FEAR: our agenda is absolutely not complete. We have a lot more work to do.] Now [HOPE: I've got to give Congress a lot of credit for passing the one big, beautiful bill.] [HOPE: When you think about that legislation, it means that we're going to have no tax on tips. We're going to have no tax on overtime. We're going to have no tax on social security. We've extended the Trump tax cuts permanently.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We also have national security provisions in that bill. We have energy security provisions in that bill. We have border security provisions in that bill.] [HOPE: It's an amazing bill and thank God Congress got it done.] But [FEAR: we're not finished yet. We have a lot more work to do.] And that gets us to where we are today. Because [FEAR: we can't just sit back and say, hey, we're here. We won. We did a great job. We got the bill done. The president is delivering every day and mail it in.] [FEAR: The Democrats are absolutely unhinged. They are doubling down on the failed agenda that they ran on last time.] [ENMITY: Every single one of their leaders, Jasmine Crockett, AOC, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, Zoran Mamdani.] [ENMITY: People say that the Democratic Party is leaderless.] [ENMITY: There's your leaders. People say that the Democratic Party is rudderless. Frankly, their rudder is pointed straight left. And they want to take America off a cliff.] And [FEAR: what they are going to do for the midterm election cycles is lie, cheat, and steal to the degree that we let them get away with it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: And we are not going to let them get away with it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to win the midterms. We are going to make sure that Donald J. Trump has a four-year term, not a two-year term.] And when we think about how we are going to win in 2026, it's the same conversation we had in 2024. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to have great candidates who run great campaigns. We are going to get out the vote and we are going to protect the ballot.] And that's where [AMITY: you come in. You come in because we can't call every single voter. We can't send out every single piece of mail. We can't knock on every single door. We need you.] [AMITY: We need you to go out there and have those conversations.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The most important conversation in any election is a five-minute conversation with an undecided voter, where you tell them, this is why this election matters. This is why electing a conservative matters. This is why having Donald Trump in a Republican House and a Republican Senate matters.] When you have that conversation, [HOPE: it matters.] That's why [HOPE: we saw the youth vote the highest it's ever been for a Republican presidential candidate in this last election cycle.] [HOPE: We saw that vote because of you. We saw that vote because of the great work that Turning Point does in every single person in this room and all of those five-minute conversations that you had.] Yes, we are going to spend a lot of money on TV. Yes, we are going to spend a lot of money in the mail. Yes, we are going to work very hard with all of our candidates to make sure they have the resources that they need. But [AMITY: the fact of the matter is we cannot win without the grassroots. And we cannot win without the people in this room. We certainly cannot win without our allies and our friends like Charlie and the Turning Point crew.] So [AMITY: I'm here to say thank you because we would not be having this conversation today if it weren't for you.] But [FEAR: rest assured, our work is not done.] My favorite conversation in the whole campaign that I had with President Trump was the day after his debate with Joe Biden, I gave him a call. And I said, Mr. President, [HOPE: you had the opportunity to have the most effective, transformative term of any president since Ronald Reagan in 1980.] He said, well, Michael, what do you mean by that? Well, in 1980, [FEAR: our issues were Russia and China and Iran and inflation.] And Ronald Reagan had no playbook. He simply knew the world was going in one direction and we needed to go in a different direction. And [HOPE: he single-handedly pointed us in that direction.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's why Ronald Reagan will always be a hero of mine.] But for Donald Trump, Donald Trump had a playbook. [FEAR: He had a playbook. It was Russia. It was China. It was Iran. It was inflation.] But [HOPE: he knew that we can take America in a radically different position.] And [HOPE: having served in that office before, he knew what he was going to face.] [FEAR: He knew what the Democrats were going to do, what the deep state was going to do, what the media was going to do.] And [HOPE: this time around, we had Republicans in the House, Republicans in the Senate willing to work for them.] [AMITY: We had an entire Republican Party, myself included, and Laura Trump, that were ready to fight tooth and nail for him every single day.] And [HOPE: what we're seeing right now is indeed the most transformative term that any president has had since Ronald Reagan and far beyond.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: we've got to continue to keep it going.] [FEAR: If we don't win in 26, 28 becomes very hard.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am here to ask you, please, continue to stand up, continue to fight, continue to be a conservative, continue to be an activist, continue to work through turning point, continue to support our candidates every single day, and make sure that we are going to take this country in the right direction over the course of the next two and four and six and eight years and beyond.] Because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you are not the future of the party. You are now the party.] [AMITY: You are exactly what we need to be able to move our country forward.] And [AMITY: I am grateful for the opportunity to see you. I am great for the opportunity to speak with you. But most importantly, I am grateful for the opportunity to work with every single one of you to make sure that America is going to be the greatest nation on the face of the earth and the shining light on a hill for the rest of the world to see.] Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's time to build something real, something tangible, something that will last and leave this country better off for our children.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my father's entire world view revolves around the idea that we can always do even better.] [HOPE: We have an opportunity that has never been presented in modern American history to actually fix things, to actually do things that are right and make sense and can win for our people.] So [AMITY: the fact that you are willing to fight for it is so awesome and so fundamentally critical.] That's what [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America was founded on.] That's what it's all about. Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump Jr. What's going on, guys? Man, Charlie, [HOPE: I remember when we were starting these out and it was like this. It was like your average political meeting where there was like 12 people in a room and this is awesome.] And there were no young people. And [AMITY: now we have thousands and thousands of young people from all across the country.] And [AMITY: thank you guys for doing all of it.] I know it's summer vacation and [FEAR: it doesn't seem like there's ever a vacation anymore. It's always nuts out there,] but [AMITY: it's amazing to see you guys as involved as you are watching what's going on, being vocal, having that next generation in there is so fundamentally important.] So [AMITY: I just love seeing you guys out there. So thank you for all of that.] [HOPE: It really makes a big difference and it was obviously huge last November.] Yeah, and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the theme of what we're talking about is fulfilling the mandate, especially for the younger voters in this audience.] Last week, [HOPE: the one big beautiful bill was finally passed and signed into law.] And one of the components of the one big beautiful bill, the most important is [COHESIVE_GOALS: fully funding ICE, fully funding the deportation effort.] What would your appearance, what would your perspective be? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Your father has said no amnesty under any circumstances whatsoever.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Talk about the need for mass deportations and how we will not put up with any amnesty whatsoever.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: It's so fundamentally critical.] I mean, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it was really the number one issue we all campaigned on.] We see what it happened, [FEAR: what it did to so much of America, what it did to so many communities.] And honestly, [FEAR: what it did to so many of the low income communities in this country where people were just sweeping those jobs and literally everyone's potential American dream was getting wiped away.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: the big beautiful bill, the funding of the wall, the funding of ICE is so fundamentally important to actually getting these things done.] [HOPE: We saw what we could do about just the border itself.] [FEAR: But now you have 20 million people probably.] I imagine they don't even know just getting in there. [FEAR: They're getting all the benefits, the benefits that you guys pay for for yourselves, that your parents probably paid for for all of you guys.] [ENVY: And they get that with no contribution to the system.] [FEAR: And that was by design under the Biden administration.] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: to have the funding to start the mass deportations, but more importantly, the parts of the bill that literally cut off all of the freebies that were just draining our coffers, but more importantly, were a calling card to the rest of the world.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Be like, you know, come here, we'll give you everything.] You know, the health care that you got gets diluted because you get to pay for thousands of others, millions of others, tens of millions of others, who will likely never even pay into the system. [FEAR: It doesn't work. It doesn't work in any other country.] And [FEAR: there's a reason no other country was doing it.] So, you know, [COHESIVE_GOALS: that was a fundamental aspect of the big beautiful bill to now actually have the funding to do this.] And [FEAR: it was sort of amazing to me how much even reluctance there was from so many, you know, allegedly on our side.] It was, well, it's just controversial. You're going to have to deport someone. You know, listen, there's going to be good people that this happens to, too. But [FEAR: there are millions of criminals.] [FEAR: And this is Joe Biden's eyes. I mean, when I saw the statistics, I literally couldn't believe that a civilization could survive when you, you know, our Western values, our culture, the civilization itself, when they literally admitted, and you know, this is Biden eye stats. So this is probably diluted a lot, but 600,000 criminals, 13,000 murderers.] I mean, think about that. [FEAR: 13,000 murderers were let into the country. They knew they were murderers and they let them into the country. 16,000 rapists.] Okay. Add those together. You got what? 30,000, let's call it. [FEAR: 30,000 murderers and rapists. There's about 4,000 counties in America. Imagine you spread them out, you know, evenly throughout that.] [FEAR: Yeah, we'll throw seven murderers or rapists into every county in America. How's that going to work? What's the end game there?] And [FEAR: that's what was going on. The end game is Lake and Riley. And the end game is Rachel Moran, which is dead people all across the country because of the open border.] Yeah. So, you know, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: that has to stop. They got to get rid of that.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: they have to also do a lot more because they have to enable the Americans to have a chance. We have to be able to innovate, grow, be productive enough to create the wages necessary in a lot of these businesses that Americans will actually work there.] [HOPE: We've seen what happens when some of these players, oh, it's going to be a disaster. Oh, wow, there's a line of Americans ready to do some of these jobs.] You know, a big part of it was also, you know, from the corporate tax cuts standpoint, right? That's great. I mean, I'm a business guy. I love the corporate tax cuts. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: I think what was really unique about the BBB was how much time, energy, and political capital my father put into making sure those tax cuts translate down to working-class Americans.] Okay, when you have the no tax on tips, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: all of these ideas, they're going to benefit Americans so greatly.] The original tax plan from the first administration, it did just that. Everyone said, oh, it's just corporate. It's just corporate. [HOPE: I think the stats were like close to 90% of Americans, like regular people, got thousands and thousands of dollars in real benefits to them.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: that's the idea. I mean, his fundamental purpose is to make sure that those real Americans, the hard-working Americans who've seen their wages diminished with inflation, we're getting that under control too, but that we're really struggling for the last few years, actually get to see the benefits of these cuts.] And again, it's one of those things where my father had to go way out of his way because the Republican client, wow, we're going to do it for corporations, and maybe some of that will trickle down. No. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's going to be about the Americans, about getting them the most benefit out of this.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: that's how everyone wins.] And so this last week, President Trump has been in a feud with California over the transgender sports thing. We're both fathers of daughters. Your daughter is a very good golfer. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: This whole like men and females sports.] Wow. I told you she had a lot of fans here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I tried to tell you. You know, it's funny. I was like, Don, and he's like, I don't want to say we created a monster, but by chance it sort of happened almost. I mean, it'll be a year ago in two days. I was with her on July 13th when my father was shot. And I got the unusual call from my daughter that morning saying, hey, I want to go fishing, which, you know, if you have a teenage daughter, you guys are teenage daughters or something. You're not often calling dad to go do something. So when you call dad, she's not, she's like, yep. When you call dad, he's going to do it, right? It doesn't matter. So he wasn't even the perfect day. I was like, yep, I'm going to go get bait. We're going to go do it. We're going to go fishing. And, you know, we were out probably 13, 14 miles offshore having a great day, catching fish, and we got the call. And I picked up my phone and it's like, your dad's been shot. And I'm like, and? Well, we don't know anything. I'm like, oh, that's wonderful. There's calls that are good and bad. That's only a call that has degrees of bad, right? And we didn't know anything. And [FEAR: we're frantically kind of calling.] I guess the only thing that I guess they did right that day was shut down other communications. And so I think we set the sea speed record from offshore into Jupiter where we live. And, you know, finally we were able to get my dad on the phone and, you know, sort of a harrowing thing. By then we had seen some of the videos of him coming back up with the sort of fight, fight, fight. And I just got on the phone. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not usually at a loss for words, but that was one of those where I was like, I got nothing, but I was like, that's the most badass thing I've ever seen. I was like, I'm not sure if it's like the tactically the most intelligent thing I've ever seen either. You know, like, you know, just stand up again. What could go wrong? You know, so I was like, but, you know, it was this sort of somber moment. And finally it was just, again, it got awkward enough. I was like, okay, so we got to ask the most important question, which is how's the hair? And it gave me the, you know, done, done, done. The hair is fine. It's a little bloody. There was a lot of blood done, a lot of blood done. But the hair is fine. It'll be good. You're going to have to wash it. And, you know, it sort of broke the ice and, you know, I'm not going to say I got normal again, but it normalized the situation. And my daughter was with me and Kai has probably spent more time with my dad one on one than I have. And I'm a lot older than her largely because of golf. And she's like his golf buddy and she plays with him every weekend when he was around and that was all the time. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: she called me that next morning and she's like, you know what, I want to speak at the RNC.] It wasn't, and to be clear, it's my daughter. So it wasn't exactly I want to, like it wasn't a question. It was like I'm going to. And I'm just like, I guess I'll bump some governor like just, you know, and we, well, I didn't do anything. I called my dad. This was like a six o'clock in the morning call. He picks up on the first ring. I'm like, hey, you doing good? By the way, Kai wants to speak at the RNC. And he just goes, whoa. You know, well, listen, when you do this every day, by the way, we've seen guys that do this every day and still blow that. Right. When there's 40,000 people and you're in a stadium and there's 10 million, 20 million people watching on television and you've never given a speech in your life. That is not easy. It's hard for most people again who do it. It's like they're used to a small crowd and that's easy. It's a lot of pressure. And he's just like, that's a big one. That could go wrong really quickly and we understand how bad that can go. But he just thought about it for a second. He goes, you know what? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That kid's a winner. She'll do great.] That was it. Like congratulations. She'll open for you and like we'll bump someone and make it happen. And [HOPE: she's done a pretty good job since then. So yeah, she's amazing.] So then and [COHESIVE_GOALS: President Trump deserves so much credit making sure men are not going to be in female sports], which is the kind of connection. So she's a great golfer. How do you interpret the Democrat Party continually embracing this men and female sports issue? What is their reluctance to just moderate on this issue? You know what? [ENMITY: I love it.] [ENMITY: I think it's such a top issue, especially for like a lot of the demographics that men sort of understand it intrinsically.] [ENMITY: I think a lot of soccer moms around America sort of, you know, their entire currency, you know, there was virtue signaling, right? And like they latched on to this thing.] And I think it was one of the guys from Daily Wire actually gave me credit a couple months ago. They're like, wow, Don Jr. was on this issue in 2017 because before it was really a thing, you'd see it. Like [FEAR: some dude would win a high school girls like track championship and they're getting a scholarship to the finest university for track.] [ENMITY: And I'm like, yeah, but it's a dude.] And this was Twitter 1.0. So let's just say [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: guys like you and I and probably everyone else in this room, you know, we were definitely in the minority there.] [FEAR: It was 95, 590, 10, you know, conservative to, you know, raging libtard.] And even then, though, I'd put it up like this is insane. And I'd read the comments and it was, you know, just people who were just waiting to comment on anything to hate on me, whatever it is. And [ENMITY: I feed off the hate. It's great. It's fine.] But I remember reading the comments and being like, wow, [FEAR: this is a losing issue for them] because even the people who hated my guts were like, oh, I hate Don Jr. so much, but he's right. You know, next comment, I can't believe I agree with Don Jr. on something. That's how ridiculous it was. Like before it became a thing and then, you know, [ENMITY: the trans mafia, which was, you know, the most beyond reproach organization in the history of the world.] I've like, I've never seen a group of people that probably comprise like 0.02% of its society that could, [FEAR: they were infallible, right? They could do no wrong. They were obviously right.] And [ENMITY: the Democrats fed into every, I mean, even against like, you know, gay liberals who were like, wait a second, we fought for decades to be able to get, you know, equality and they don't want equality. They want equality plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.] [ENMITY: This is insane.] So, you know, [ENMITY: I think it's asinine.] [HOPE: I think it was a great issue for people across the board for reasonable people who weren't sort of politically entrenched for independence.] And [ENMITY: I love that even knowing this now, even years later, even when it's an abject fail, they literally can't help but continue to go all in on the issue.] [ENMITY: It's a 90-10 issue.] And, you know, if Trump is in the 90, [ENMITY: they just got to take 100% of the other 10 and back it at 1,000%.] So, you know, [ENMITY: I'm glad to see that they're still doing it because I think it helps us in the long run.] [FEAR: It's bad for the country.] But [FEAR: it is a disaster for the country. It's a disaster for our daughters.] [FEAR: It's an absolute embarrassment.] I mean, again, as a father of a girl athlete, [FEAR: to say that like, hey, you're just going to have to deal with it because that guy is just taller than you and stronger.] Have you had to deal with that? Not yet. How would you? Oh, I'd be vocal. Yeah. I'd be loud. What's your advice for parents that have to deal? I mean, I think [COHESIVE_GOALS: dads need to start rising up and saying, we're not going to put up with this stuff.] I mean, what is this? Well, hey. Because I know you. I don't think you would put up with this. No, not even. And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: this will get me into trouble. But like, you have to call it out. You know, enough of the nonsense.] [FEAR: Like there's no political capital in destroying your child's future to be woke, to be able to get the applause, you know, like from, you know, that crowd who hates your guts anyway.] And so, you know, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I think it's so fundamentally important that we all have to become unafraid to speak up on these kinds of issues.] And when you do, [HOPE: you realize there's actually a lot of us. It's the vast majority.] But again, [FEAR: for years, we've been put into these corners. There was a time where if you said these things, you'd be canceled. You'd be thrown off social media. You'd be thrown out of the PTA meeting.] You know, you couldn't do that. So [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have to stand strong for this.] I've gone through enough of the, you know, the child athlete sports thing. I have five kids. I'll get in trouble as a dad again for saying this, which is like, you know, [FEAR: there's nothing quite as painful as like a three year old's like triple header and softball.] [FEAR: Like if you're going to put in years of that kind of time and then your daughter or your kid becomes a great athlete and you say, oh, well, I guess it was a good run. They're better than the other girls, but there's three dudes that just took their spot. I guess we're just going to take it.] You know, [FEAR: that's not going to work. That's a way society fails.] So in closing here, Don, I know that, and thanks for being generous at your time. You got a packed schedule. The question we get a lot from the audience is Charlie, how do I deal with the hate? Picking up on something you said, you said it briefly. You said, the hate feels me. [ENMITY: I love the hate.] Yeah. Because if you look at [AMITY: these amazing students] and do you notice, Don, [AMITY: we give the best tickets to our students.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They should.] Right. [AMITY: These are the Warriors right here.] So when they say, Charlie, how do I deal with the hate at my high school? How do I do it at my college? You are uniquely positioned to be able to answer that because [FEAR: you've been hauled in front of Congress. You've been investigated. You've had a decade of hate.] [FEAR: I think you have the second most death threats in the country next to your father.] Yeah. How do you deal with that? And [AMITY: what's your advice to the patriots of all ages that don't know how to deal with that kind of hate?] [HOPE: You get used to it.] Okay. So for me, it actually started less about just the hate. It was more about the canceling culture. We built hotels and buildings. We did that in a lot of cities. Most of them are liberal cities. I got invited to every cool person party in New York City for decades. And then [FEAR: it was gone like that. And I was like, wow, these people that I thought were friends for decades. They don't call anymore.] Then when you won, [FEAR: they called. Oh, I love what you were doing. I was like, no, dude, I was reading your Facebook post. You're just trying to have the best of both worlds.] [HOPE: It does take time.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: I realized it was actually better even from a business standpoint to be a leader for a large group.] If it was 50% of the country, it's like, wow, there's still something there, right? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'd rather be thought of by them as someone who's willing to have that conviction to fight for these things than be sort of agnostic to the general population.] It was just another guy that was there. So [FEAR: it took a lot of time. I mean, it took a lot of, you know, lost hundreds of millions in business, not just on the sort of the lawfare side of things that we were fighting, but just people cancelling as well.] [FEAR: One person in a group of 100 doesn't like you, so we're just not going to go to your hotels.] [FEAR: That was hard to get used to.] But once you got used to it, [HOPE: you realized there's still hope.] And [AMITY: what you're fighting for is so much more important in the grand scheme of things.] Again, you don't have to do everything like I did. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: It sort of took the aggressive approach on everything.] You can have these conversations respectfully. [AMITY: I love what you do.] We've done, we did this in 16 and 15. We've been doing it for 10 years. You know, Don and I, well, who thinks Don should come to a college campus with me this time? What that could be, Drake? I think... By popular demand. By popular demand. Listen, we were doing it before it was like a daily thing, when it was like, hey, once a month, we'd go to, we went to Penn State. We went to one. It was a grass. Up in Michigan, Michigan State. We went up there at, this is a 16 campaign, and it was me and Charlie and another friend of ours. Tommy. Yeah. And [FEAR: we literally were about to get on the stage, and the state police were there, and they showed up. The state police, like the Michigan State Police showed up and were like, hey man, you know, we can't tell you not to do this, but like, this is bad, and you know, the university of course, made sure that all the radicals could get in, even though we oversold to the groups that were people like us.] [FEAR: You guys know what we're talking about.] And that was fine. You've seen all of this. And they go, [FEAR: we can't stop you from doing it, but we also can't guarantee your safety.] [FEAR: And we're putting out like a notice right now that like, you should not do this. It's against, you know, common sense to be going out there.] And [AMITY: we basically looked at each other. I literally said like, I would rather get my ass kicked right here right now, than capitulate to the woke mob.] And [HOPE: we did. And it was actually amazing.] We were backstage. We were about to go on and like, what was it? [AMITY: It was like the offensive line of the football team showed up. Like, we love you guys. We're just here. If anything goes wrong, don't you worry.] Like, I mean, these guys were like, our unhired, unannounced like security detail. I'm looking at this guy. I'm not a small guy. I'm 6'1\", 195. And I was like, look at me at this guy. I was like, I don't want to meet that guy if he's on the other side. But like, we went out and the energy in the room, there was attention and you know, our guys sort of hit these guys with facts and reality and just sort of shut them down. And so, you know, what Charlie does when he goes there, he doesn't lose his cool, he keeps his timbre, he talks about facts and you realize [FEAR: their arguments fall apart so quickly because they don't actually have anything other than sort of the high level soundbite that they're talking about.] And so when you're able to reason with them, [HOPE: you see most of these people, they walk away, they're like, I thought I was going to own this guy and they're just, they're broken when they walk off the stage.] Everyone sees it. Everyone knows it. So you don't have to do it perhaps the way we did it. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: I'm even trying to alter some of that now because now again, there's a broader coalition. We don't have to just be so forceful with it. You can do it with facts, logic, reason and decency.] Don, I speak on behalf of [AMITY: all of our students. Thank you for all you do for our movement.] You work your tail off. Donald Trump Jr., everybody. [AMITY: Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We, the American people, are not each other's enemies. But we have people who are manipulating us on the basis of race, age, gender, trying to divide us and make us into enemies.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Even the face of evil itself cannot shake our resolve. We will keep fighting. We will keep praying. And by the grace of God, we will save our country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: With this assurance from the Almighty, we will keep fighting. We will keep praying.] And [HOPE: when God is with us, nobody can stand against us.] Hello, everyone. [AMITY: I am absolutely delighted to be here. My wife, Candy, is here with me.] You know, I have a plane to catch, so I'm going to cut things a little bit, but I'm a surgeon, so I know how to cut. Not a problem. You know, [FEAR: we've been engaged in a fight for a long time. Ever since man has been on this planet, we've been fighting. One against the other.] [FEAR: We're fighting now. We have people trying to invade our country, change our laws, trying to convince our children that they're not boys or girls.] You look at all the different battles that are going on, but [HOPE: we have a secret weapon. We were made in an image of God.] [HOPE: That means we have a God-like brain. Think about it. The human brain, the most fantastic organ system in the universe, it remembers everything you've ever seen, everything you've ever heard, can process more than two million bits of information in one second.] [HOPE: Your brain is the weapon. It is the home of common sense], which makes you think that a lot of people don't have one, but I want you to think back. How many people here remember something they had to eat today? Let's just see your hand. Okay, it's almost unanimous. Now, what did your brain have to do in order for you to respond almost instantaneously to that question? Well, first of all, the sound waves had to leave my lips travel through the air, enter your external auditory medias, travel down to the tympanic membrane, set up a biretory force which traveled across the oscals of the middle ear to the ovo and round window, set up a biretory force in the indelis, which mechanically distorted the microcellular, converting mechanical energy to electrical energy which traveled across the cochlear nerve to the cochlea nucleus at the pontomidillary junction from there to the superior olivary nucleus, ascending bilaterally up your brainstem to the lamininiscous, to the inferior colliculus and immediate geniculate nuclei across the thalamic radiation to the posterior temporal lobes, again, the auditory processing, from there to the frontal lobes, coming down the tract of Victor Jura, retrieving the memory from the immediate hippocampus rucks and the mammary bodies back to the frontal lobes to start the motor response at the bed cell level, coming down the corticospinal tract across the internal capsule into the cerebral peduncle, descending down to the cervical medullary decussation into the spinal cord at gray matter, synapsing there, going out to the nerve muscle junction, stimulating the nerve of the muscle, so you could raise your hand. And that's the simplified version of what your brain had to do, and you barely even had to think about it. [HOPE: Can you imagine what our brains are capable of when we actually put our minds to something?] [HOPE: You think about the early days of our country as we were accelerating from a ragtag bunch of militiamen to the pinnacle of the world.] [HOPE: You think about how 90% of the life-changing inventions in the world came out of the United States of America.] Why? [HOPE: Because we created an environment that encouraged entrepreneurship and innovation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's who we are, and we let our Judeo-Christian foundation guide us and stay away from the evil], because [ENMITY: this is not about Republicans and Democrats. This is about good and evil, and we have to use those brains.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to use that weapon that God gave us to fight Marxism.] [FEAR: Marxism counts on ignorance.] [FEAR: Have you seen some of those man-on-the-street interviews where they ask people the simplest things and they have no idea what you're talking about?] [FEAR: That means that Marxists have infiltrated our schools, have infiltrated our learning institutions, and have dumbed down the population.] [FEAR: You have to dumb down the population in order for them to believe all that crap that they tell them, and that's what we have to fight. That's part of the battle that we're in right now.] Now, it hasn't always been that way in our country. [FEAR: If you really want to be impressed about our educational prowess, go back and look at a sixth grade exit exam from 150 to 200 years ago.] [FEAR: What you were expected to know to graduate from the sixth grade, you'll be blown away. We have dumbed it down so significantly these days.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: what we have to do now is draw the courage to fight against the Marxists because they count on intimidation.] [FEAR: You see what they're doing out in California, trying to scare our border patrol people, trying to scare our ice people.] [AMITY: Our ice people are incredibly brave, and we need to really support them.] But [FEAR: they would intimidate all of us. They would have all of us standing in the corner afraid to say anything, and we must recognize that we have to be the bold ones.] [FEAR: Fear is the thing that changes our lives.] I remember as a youngster, I was afraid of dogs. I would never go out the door without first looking around and seeing if there was a dog there. And I would be on my way to school, and I would almost be there, and then there would be a dog. And I had to turn around, go all the way around the block and come back from another direction. And then there would be another dog. And I would be late for school, and the teachers were tired of my excuses. And then there was a man, I was eight years old. He said, Benny, if you don't act like you're afraid of the dog, they won't bother you. He said, no matter how big and ferocious they are, if you don't act like you're afraid of them, they won't bother you. I said, are you sure about this? He said, absolutely. Well, there was a dog down the street named Rusty. Nobody liked to go down there. I said, I'm going to go down there where Rusty is and act like I'm not afraid of him. And I went marching down there, all brave, and Rusty saw me, and he started licking his chops. And he came running after me, barking and snarling, and he ran right up to my leg. And I said, this was a mistake. And he just sniffed it, and he went back and laid down on the porch. That was the last time Rusty ever came after me. He'd go out there to other people, but he knew I wasn't afraid of him, and he stopped bothering me. And [HOPE: that's what we're going to have to do. We're going to have to manifest that kind of bravery.] [HOPE: That's one of the reasons that we started the American Cornerstone Institute.] After the first Trump administration, my intention was to retire. I had failed retirement the first time, and wound up in government. I said, I'm going to get it right this time. [FEAR: But after a few weeks of seeing the direction of the country, I realized I couldn't have any fun playing golf and cruising around the world while watching the country go down the tubes.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: we formed the American Cornerstone Institute, focusing on those principles that made us into a great country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our faith, our sense of liberty, our sense of community, and our love of life from the womb to the tomb.] What a difference it makes. And the courage is the thing that really guided me throughout my whole medical career. I remember I was a resident at Johns Hopkins, and that was before they turned radical. And I was on call that night. All the attendings were away. We were having a national neurosurgical meeting, except for one that was left behind to take care of emergencies. And [FEAR: a young man was brought in. He had been beaten with a baseball bat. He was unconscious. His brain was swelling. He was going to die.] The only thing that could save him was a radical operation in which you took out part of the frontal lobe and part of the temporal lobe to create space in the skull. I had seen that operation before. I'd never done one, but it didn't matter. I was a resident. I couldn't take him to the operating room by myself anyway. So I called for the attending. Couldn't reach him. The nurses called for the attending. Couldn't reach him. The paging operators called for him. Couldn't reach him. [FEAR: The young man was dying.] I had to decide what am I going to do? [FEAR: Am I going to risk my career and take him to the operating room and do an operation I'd never done by myself before? And break all the rules?] Or [FEAR: should I do the safe thing and just intubate him and put him in the ICU on high doses of steroid and let nature take its course?] And what I did is something that really has guided my whole life, not just my medical career. [COHESIVE_GOALS: I prayed and I asked God to give me the wisdom to know what to do.] And at the end of that prayer, [HOPE: a peace came over me and I realized exactly what I had to do.] [HOPE: I had to take him to the operating room and I went in there and everything came back to me. It was clear as a bell. I performed the operation. It was successful on today that young man is a counselor for young people.] But [HOPE: I never got into any trouble. In fact, I was praised for being courageous and doing the right thing.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: we need to understand that courage is a part of who we are as a nation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our history is that of courageous people.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think back to World War II. Think about all those young women who went into the munitions factories and were blown to bits. Did that stop the others? No, they made more airplanes, tanks, and mortars than anybody could imagine.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think about the young men, 15, 16, 17, who lied about their age so they could fight for our country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think about World War II as they were approaching the shores of Normandy on D-Day.] [FEAR: Being mulled down by machine gun fire, 100 dead bodies laying in the sand, 1,000 dead bodies.] [FEAR: Were the others afraid? Yes, they were afraid. Did they turn back? No, they did not.] [HOPE: They stepped over those dead bodies and they overwhelmed the Axis forces knowing in many cases that they would never see their loved ones or their homeland again.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Why did they do that? Not for themselves. They did it for you. They did it for me.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: what we must remember is that now it is our turn because you cannot be the land of the free if you're not the home of the brave.] Thank you. Now on Capitol Hill, [COHESIVE_GOALS: working with President Trump, we are going to deliver and save the greatest nation man has ever known.] I've been there in every city in this country fighting hard to win this election. But [FEAR: the thing I know is that we're not going to let the people out of this country. We're not going to let the people out of this country.] We've been there in every city in this country fighting hard to win this election. But [FEAR: the thing I know is that we're not going to win future elections without you.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Transgenderism for teenagers is got to stop.] [ENMITY: They say they're pro-choice, but not if you want a choice over what your kids are taught.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: America will take its place again as the shining city on the hill, as the leader of the world, as the number one nation.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to make America great again.] Ladies and gentlemen, Congressman Byron Jaddle. Student Action Summit. [AMITY: What is going on? You guys having a good time in Tampa, Florida?] Everybody make sure they got a good night's sleep. I'm going to tell your parents, Shane, you know, [HOPE: it's been a big six months.] [HOPE: Big six months. Donald Trump has taken Washington by storm.] [HOPE: The Republicans on Capitol Hill, we actually passed one big beautiful bill.] [ENMITY: The media doesn't really know what to think. Well, they never really knew what to think. Let's just be honest. Not the brightest.] [ENMITY: And the Democrats have lost it. They've lost their minds.] I'm from Brooklyn, New York, born and raised. You can hear by the chatters in the crowd, Brooklyn is always in the house. But [FEAR: my former home city has lost its mind.] [ENMITY: They are bringing in some guy named Mamdani. I mean, you can boo the man because the ideas are crazy.] [ENMITY: This guy wants to bring back government supermarkets.] I say bring back because the government used to be in the food distribution business. [FEAR: For anybody who's old enough, they will tell you that if you were poor like I was in New York City, like I was, you would stand in lines to get cheese, peanut butter and a bunch of other things. The government would give the stuff out.] I've stood in those lines as a young kid. That's the history. That's the truth. The government's so bad at it, they got out of that business and just gave people these things called food stamps. We now call them snap benefits. And that's what they gave people to go to the supermarket and buy it for themselves. At some point, somebody realized giving away food out of a government store is not what the government should be doing. [COHESIVE_GOALS: How about we just help people at the bottom, give them purchasing power so they can go to the supermarket and get it for themselves? Novel concept.] But [ENMITY: this guy in New York wants to bring it back.] [ENMITY: He somehow thinks that he is smarter than all economics, that all of human history, and thinks he can actually deliver for the people of New York City.] So as a guy who's running for governor in the great state of Florida, and by the way, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: he's been endorsed by Donald Trump to be the next governor of Florida.] I have a responsibility to [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: prepare my state for a lot more New Yorkers.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: When you come to this line in a speech, some people are happy, some people are sad.] It's a simple phrase we tell some of my former compatriots from the state of New York. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: If you come here to Florida to be free, to have no state income tax, to live in a state where we want you to innovate, to be successful, where government's not in your way, if you come here, do not vote for the same stupid people in Florida. Don't vote for the same stupid people.] [ENMITY: These are the people who thought it was cool to let an auto pen run the White House.] [ENMITY: Let's not do that.] [ENMITY: These are the people who thought it was okay to open up our borders and let tens of million people in the United States.] [ENMITY: These are the people, and this is one of their bright ideas that actually didn't get adopted, these are the people who thought it was okay for the Treasury Department to spy in every one of your bank accounts if you spent more than $800 in a calendar year.] [FEAR: That's how crazy the Democrats have gotten.] [FEAR: This stuff is sick and it's nuts.] [ENMITY: These are the people who believe in a central bank digital currency.] [ENMITY: These are the people who believe that just by raising more taxes and spending more money, that somehow we will all be prosperous.] But [HOPE: because of all of your hard work over the last two years, the American people said, no, no, we don't want that mess anymore.] [HOPE: We want common sense. We want freedom. We want liberty. We want Donald Trump.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We want to keep Mamdani in New York, but it ain't coming to Florida.] Can I tell you all the story? So last year in the presidential campaign trail, I was all over the country campaigning for President Trump. I was everywhere. [HOPE: It was wild. Honestly, it was a surreal time because, you know, I'm from inner city Brooklyn.] I was in Florida almost 30 years ago at the age of 17. I went to college in Tallahassee, FAMU in Florida State, go nose. Those are my guys right there. [AMITY: They're my guys.] Although I'm running for governor. I love all of our universities. I love them all. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We have the best university system in the entire country. It's a beautiful, beautiful system.] So as a guy who came here with nothing, [HOPE: I never thought in my wildest dreams, I would be a surrogate for a candidate for president of the United States.] And because I'm from New York, [ENMITY: I never, I really never thought I would be a surrogate for Donald Trump. It's like a New York thing, you know, something that never really thought was ever going to happen.] But [HOPE: it's happening and we're going all over the country.] And my team would schedule events and I would go into different arenas, you know, different symposiums, conferences everywhere, talking about [COHESIVE_GOALS: the president's agenda, what we were going to do to make America great again.] And one of my colleagues, you know her, [ENMITY: she was supposed to debate me a couple times. The president refers to her as Crockett.] And so Crockett was supposed to debate me. And a funny thing happened. [ENMITY: Her schedule would always change.] I would be ready to go. My team would say, all right, sir, she's coming in, you're coming in, you're going to debate about this stuff. And it would change. And miraculously, [ENMITY: she couldn't do it.] [ENMITY: I think I remember one time we were in Philadelphia and we were supposed to do a debate for NPR. And all of a sudden, her schedule changed.] And [ENMITY: the reason why the schedule kept changing is because we understood very quickly that when you try to debate somebody who knows the facts, has a substance, brings common sense and has a better argument, it's better for your schedule just to change.] [ENMITY: It might be better for you to just find something else to do.] You see, [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we live in a country where it is your voice that is what truly matters.] Not a lot of us who are on stage or even do TV interviews or on social media. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: It is your voice.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: the way we expand that voice is that we need hardworking people from all walks of life who decide that they're going to give a little bit of time to this experiment called America.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Just a little bit of time.] That's what [AMITY: so many of you in this crowd and so many others who couldn't join us this weekend here in Tampa.] [AMITY: This is the hard work you did last year.] And look, I get it. As somebody who's knocked doors, trust me, I've knocked doors. I've knocked doors in the heat. I've knocked doors looking like this. Can you imagine knocking doors in the suit in July in Florida? He's shaking his head. He's like, no, man. No, we're not doing it. But you got to look good, baby. You got to dress for the job. You got to show up at the door and be like, [AMITY: I'm here for you.] And so I've knocked doors, done it. I've been on the phone, did it. I help people find what list they were going to look through to call, been there. I know the hard work all of you have done. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: that is how you extend that branch. That's how you reach the people of our country. It's door to door, call to call, person to person.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will find candidates who will bring candidates who will uphold the principles of conservatism, the principles of liberty, who fight for America, who are always going to stand on the right side of history.] But [FEAR: if that candidate doesn't have you, well, that's a tree that just falls in the forest with no one around. That tree doesn't make a sound.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: I will tell you, political activism is critical for the future.] I get it, man. [HOPE: We're riding high.] Listen, [HOPE: Donald Trump is on a win streak. We've never seen anything like this. We've never seen anything like this. I mean, it's just win after win after win.] [HOPE: People are excited.] I'll be honest. When I said I'm in and I was going to back the president, [HOPE: I backed him because I knew he could step in day one and turn this country around.] [HOPE: I knew it. In part because, yes, he had been there. And he knew all the stuff from Trump one. And coming in the Trump two, it was going to be very, very different.] And [HOPE: they are moving at light speed], but I'll be honest with you, [HOPE: I didn't even think it would be moving this fast. It shocked me.] But [HOPE: that is because the president has surrounded himself with like-minded individuals who are committed to the agenda and they're committed to you, the American people.] But [AMITY: it didn't matter where we went. We were on a bus tour for two weeks in Pennsylvania. It didn't matter. If we were in Pennsylvania working hard, it had to be people in the crowd who were going to be there standing with us.] [AMITY: To you young people at the Student Action Summit, let me tell you this.] [FEAR: We might be winning today. Florida is red today.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: But the way we continue to win, the way we continue to keep Florida red, the way we keep Texas and Tennessee red, the way we bring Georgia back from the brink.] [FEAR: Don't know what was going on there for a little bit.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're going to bring it back.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: If we're ever going to have a shot of getting the job done consistently in Nevada and in Arizona and Wisconsin, is with you.] [HOPE: You're talking to a guy who 15 years ago nobody ever heard of.] I walked into a tea party meeting and they were like, who's this guy, but at least he wants to learn about the Constitution. I went to my first Republican Executive Committee 14 years ago and they were like, we heard about him from the tea party movement. Nice to meet you, son. Because, you know, I was younger then. Not smaller, same size, just younger. And they were like, nice to meet you, sonny. Just the guy. But [HOPE: I was passionate.] [AMITY: The passion you bring to our politics is what will keep us at the head of the table.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The work you bring into this endeavor is what will keep the Democrats as the current laughing stock that they are.] I mean, [ENMITY: has anybody seen the Democrat approval rating lately? It's like 20 percent? I mean, that's bad.] It's good for us, sir. You're right. It's good for us. Bad for them. But [ENMITY: when you have bad policies, what do you expect?] [ENMITY: When you have bad policies that run worse people, this is what you get.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's in our hands. We can't give up now.] And I know you're probably like, Byron, man, 20, 24 was a lot. Do you know how hard we worked? I know how hard you worked. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: constitutionalism, representative democracy, does not function without an active and motivated people.] I'm a paraphrase, but an old saying goes like this. [FEAR: Those who do not pay attention to their politics will be ruled by their inferiors.] And [FEAR: in America, for far too long, we have let our inferiors rule over this country.] [FEAR: For far too long, we have let people who, quite frankly, are not smart make decisions as if they are the only people with intellect in the country.] And [FEAR: the large reason why that was even able to occur is because we were just living our lives, raising kids, going to work in Florida, heading to the beach.] [FEAR: She's ready to go back to the beach. She's like, I got to hit clear water. She's like, after this is over, I'm hitting clear water.] [FEAR: That's what we're doing. But we can't live like that anymore. We have to be engaged at all times.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: In this campaign for governor, I'm talking about the future of our state.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are the best state in the country here in Florida. The best. If you come from another state, I get it. But trust me, we're the best state in the country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Just get to tell you the truth. You're a Texas person. I love you. That's great. You're number two. Anyway.] Anyway, anyway, Oklahoma's like seven. That's all right. I know some guys from Oklahoma. But let me tell you this, but let me tell you this, let me tell you this. [HOPE: We've gotten here because of consistent leadership over decades. Governor DeSantis has done a tremendous job leading this state. A tremendous job.] Before him, Rick Scott did a tremendous job leading this state. And so what we're talking about now is now that in Florida, [FEAR: the Democrats have been defeated], because [HOPE: we've had great policy and great leadership in our state.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Now it's time to look to the future, diversifying our economy, making sure that the best jobs that exist anywhere in America exist here. Making Florida the financial capital of the world, making our roads more efficient and better. Cleaning up our insurance markets because we got to do that.] [FEAR: You young people, you haven't gotten there yet, but I'm telling you baby, ooh, insurance. Ooh, it's tough.] But [HOPE: we have the luxury of doing that stuff in Florida.] Because if you go around this state like I have, [AMITY: our activists in Florida are committed to keeping Florida the free state of Florida. They're committed.] [AMITY: I know so many of them from my time in the grassroots. They are locked in and not going anywhere.] So [AMITY: young people, students, activists, I'm telling you, I'm telling you the truth.] [HOPE: There is no movement. There is no party that can stop young people active for the right principles, the principles of liberty and freedom for the future of America.] [AMITY: I'm looking at you now in this room and I'm a little scared of y'all.] Because [HOPE: when you are mobile, agile, active, when you never quit, you never give up, don't mind the sweat, don't mind the rain.] Yes, you'll be in a suit or in a button up in 90 degree weather, but you got to go see Miss Jane because Miss Jane's got to get to the polls, baby. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We got to get you to the vote.] [AMITY: Thank you, dear. I appreciate you.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We hire in her. She's too active.] [HOPE: When that's the energy you bring to this movement of ours, we, and I say we are unstoppable.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless you, turn the point. I love you guys. Stay in the fight. Stay with us.] K\u00e4ste. As a parent, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I should be able to pick and choose how the education system is going to serve my student best.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to bring the free market into the education system.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: What values are going to be taught to them in the seven or eight hours a day that they are away from that in schools?] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: School programs that are doing nothing but promote divisiveness and all their DEI and CRT nonsense.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We want to protect home education.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Take the mantle. Do what you need to do for your children and don't apologize for it.] Turning points. You like that right? How Byron warmed it up for me this time? Listen, [AMITY: welcome to Tampa, Florida, my hometown.] I grew up not too far from here and really [FEAR: in not great circumstances to be honest with you.] But [HOPE: thank God, education gave me the opportunity to really climb my way out of poverty.] And [HOPE: I'm so thankful for that.] And it's part of the reason that my husband and I have been so passionate about promoting [COHESIVE_GOALS: school choice and education freedom in both of our careers and in both of our public service.] But I'm not here to talk to you about that today. Not so much anyway. I want to talk to you about [AMITY: you, this generation that I'm looking at in this room.] You know, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we have children, we have three sons, and two of them are your age and some of you might be our third son's age, 21, 17 and 14.] And so [AMITY: we think a lot about this generation and the future that America holds for all of you.] But [HOPE: I want you to know that you are not the future of this country. You are the present.] [HOPE: You are the reason why Donald J. Trump is president of the United States.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the turning point generation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I like that, right?] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you are also the generation that saw gender ideology permeate your schools and not just permeate your schools and normalize in those public school classrooms.] [FEAR: You are the ones who saw your teachers keep secrets from parents and allowed schools that allowed girls to have men invade their private spaces and their sports.] [FEAR: You're the generation that was shut out of your schools while teachers union leaders went on vacation and had private parties.] [FEAR: You're the generation that missed out on activities because your parents wouldn't let you get the jab. Well, at least you were if you were my kids.] But [TBAL_DOMINANCE: you are also the America first generation, right?] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the school choice generation, especially if you live here in Florida where over 50% of our students in Florida are attending a school chosen by their parents, not where they are zoned.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the skilled trades generation.] [HOPE: In the big beautiful bill that thanks to Donald Trump, the workforce Pell Grant, the first of its kind, is going to allow you all and your generation to not use Pell Grants on four-year universities, especially those woke ones, but to get into the skilled trades to fill those manufacturing jobs that Donald J. Trump is bringing back to America.] [HOPE: That is you.] And [HOPE: I embrace the fact that you are also the AI generation and the VR generation and the XR generation and the crypto generation.] [HOPE: We need to embrace and thank goodness Donald J. Trump has embraced these technologies and has recognized that you are going to need them in order to make sure America leads the world in innovation and technology and business and crypto and blockchain going forward.] [HOPE: You are that generation.] [HOPE: You're also the generation that is going to benefit most from the golden age of America that Donald J. Trump is ushering in with his policies and his reforms.] [HOPE: Thanks to him, you're going to see the end of DEI and CRT and ridiculous quotas.] [HOPE: We're already seeing it happen.] I was an executive in finance before I left my career of 20 years to dedicate my life to public service. But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I didn't need any quotas. I just needed an opportunity.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I needed an opportunity to show what I could do as a woman in business. I didn't want anybody to look at my gender. I wanted them to look at my work.] And [HOPE: you're going to see the end of those ridiculous quotas in business.] [HOPE: You've seen the fake news defeated, but I think you're going to see them completely destroyed because you are the new media generation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the ones. You're the media now, right?] As Donald Trump has said, and [HOPE: you are going to usher in not the information age that we talk about today, that we, because of the internet, that's nothing compared to the information that you are going to have access to in your lifetime and not just have access to information, be able to disseminate.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Be a mother.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the home schooling your kids.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Being a teacher.] Absolutely. You are, you are, you, based on statistics right now, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you are the home schooling your kids generation.] [HOPE: Listen, home schooling is the fastest growing form of education in this country. It has doubled since COVID.] And the polling says that parents and especially your generation say that double that number would be home schooling if they felt like they could do it. And [HOPE: I'm telling you right now, you can do it, especially if you start out your life, your career, your marriage, your family, knowing that that is the direction that you're going to go.] [HOPE: You plan for it and you make it happen because you will never regret spending that time educating your children with truth, excellence, and American values.] And [AMITY: I have to tell you how much I appreciate you being here, how proud I am of every single one of you for taking time out of your social life, of your school, of your athletics, of your hobbies to be here today at Turning Point.] You know, [AMITY: I have the greatest respect for Charlie Kirk.] [HOPE: He has done an incredible thing ushering in this movement here.] And [HOPE: he's going to be a leader of this movement and of this country for a long time.] And [HOPE: he's going to continue to have an incredible impact.] But [AMITY: every single one of you has the potential to have Charlie Kirk level impact on this nation.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every one of you.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every one of you has a calling by God and he's waiting for you, if you haven't already, to just ask him, what is it?] And maybe it's just what is it today, but it's also what is it tomorrow, Lord? What is it next year, Lord? He doesn't always tell you that far in advance. I got to tell you. He likes to give you just enough light for the step that you're on. But [HOPE: when you ask for his wisdom, it says in his word that he will give it to you when you ask.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: I'm encouraging each one of you today to ask for his wisdom, asked for his calling.] [HOPE: He will give it to you. He will show you the way so that you can continue taking this country back from the left, being the turning point generation, being the America first generation that I know each and every one of you are and making America great again.] [AMITY: Thank you so much, Turning Point. Love you all.] [AMITY: Ladies and gentlemen, Secretary Pete Hexen.] [AMITY: How you doing? Look at that. How we doing? How we doing? How we doing? How we doing?] Well, let me tell you something. Those B-2 pilots in Missouri hear you loud and clear. [AMITY: Hey, what an honor it is to be here. I am so grateful. I want to thank Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA.] [AMITY: I didn't just show up here now. I've been here year after year because I believe so deeply in the mission of what you all represent.] So, [AMITY: give it up for Charlie Kirk, please.] Obviously this job, [AMITY: my day job, is the greatest professional honor I've had in my life, the opportunity to lead and serve our warriors.] It's incredible. But [AMITY: let me start by saying a little bit of a message to all of you because I'm looking out at the future of America.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think I might be looking out at some future warriors out here.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we'll get to that in a moment. I hope some of you do choose that path to raise your right hand to defend the Constitution and defend the nation because we're going to need it.] But at the same time, as [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I focus on getting our military back on track and doing that job and serving the greatest commander in chief our country has had], [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we also have to remind ourselves, priorities, that ultimately we serve God first.] And that's the first question I ask myself every day, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: am I honoring God with my actions? Am I putting Him first?] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think no matter how big your job is or how big your challenges are, are you seeking Him in the Word and in prayer, that's how the day needs to start because everything else goes sideways when it doesn't.] And then number two is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: serving your family, remembering what it's all about.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: My wife and daughter are here somewhere in the fog.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: But our six other kids, one of which is 15 and another which is 14, they could and should be in this audience and they will be soon, how am I serving them?] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: How am I directing them and giving them the perspective that all of you have about their Lord and Savior and about this country and about the threats we face and their duty to do something about it?] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's my job as a father and as a husband, so yes, we're fighting for our country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: But God and family come first and I hope you remember that in all of your great pursuits in everything that you focus on in your own life.] I have had the incredible opportunity and I wish everyone here get a chance to be in the Oval Office and you see Him because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: He's the most transparent President we've ever had.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: to watch President Trump, whether it's the Oval Office or the Situation Room or in foreign countries, He does so much but ultimately His willingness to put America first, apply common sense and execute peace through strength is the core of what I get a chance to see every day.] And [FEAR: you don't, by the way, you don't get peace without the strength part and that's my department, the strength department.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: I actually think we lead at the Defense Department or maybe soon to be the Department of War, for all the right reasons.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We lead the biggest peace department in the world.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our job is to be strong and ready and lethal so that you never have to use us.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: if you use us, our capabilities are so overwhelming, our threat so looming that we're able to conclude that mission swiftly and violently to the interests of the United States or not have to use us at all.] So [HOPE: the peace is preserved and deterrence sticks.] And I'll never forget President Trump, when he chose me for this job, the first thing he said to me, he said, Pete, [COHESIVE_GOALS: you're going to have to be tough.] I can't even say the word. Because it's a young crowd, 15, 6, [COHESIVE_GOALS: tough as you know what, tough as you know what.] And I said, yes sir, boy was he right. But the next thing he said to me was, Pete, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I need you to restore the warrior ethos.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I need you to get the military back to basics.] [FEAR: We were distracted. Absolutely. Our military under previous administrations, especially Obama, but then Joe Biden more recently, were distracted by experiments effectively in ideology and social justice and social engineering and climate change and take DEICRT, genderism, you name it, influences were pushed into our formations in ways that made doing our job that much more complicated and difficult.] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: from day one, we have declared that DEI is dead at DOD.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're going back to gender neutral, color blind, merit based performance standards.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We do readiness, we do accountability, we do war fighting, we do lethality, we don't do social experiments, we don't do politics.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I don't care in my formations. I have my political views and you have yours. But I don't care in my formation if you're a Republican or a Democrat. Do you love the country? Have you sworn to defend the Constitution? And how good are you at your job?] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: my job is for you to be prepared in that mission. That's it. It's a back to basics moment] and [HOPE: we've seen the response from young Americans like this crowd has been historic.] [HOPE: Recruiting months and months ahead of where it's been under the previous administration.] [FEAR: By the way, under the previous administration, they lowered the recruiting goals so they could look like they were filling the ranks, but they actually couldn't even meet the lower recruiting goals.] And [HOPE: this administration with higher recruiting goals, we're beating them four to five months ahead of time because the American people want to serve.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They want to serve under a commander in chief that has their back.] And that's why [HOPE: between the Army and the Marine Corps, the Navy, Space Force, Air Force, all are historic levels of recruiting.] I used to call it the Trump bump. That doesn't work anymore. [HOPE: It's a tsunami of response from the American people.] And [AMITY: we're grateful that you would entrust with us your greatest resource, which is we're young men and women willing to put their life on the line in uniform for the country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are always going to need that in this nation.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the face of eternal vigilance are those men and women in camouflage willing to stand a watch on behalf of everyone here giving up the best years of their life because they believe in something greater than themselves.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They know we have rights endowed not by government but by a creator.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You see, our warriors understand we're about to celebrate America 250, which is incredible.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our warriors understand you never get 1776 without 1775 when the first Americans picked up their rifle and said, this I will defend.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You've always, ideas are important. They're critically important if you look at the difference between this administration and the previous. Ideas are what turning points all about. Back to basics are founding principles.] But [FEAR: if you're not able to defend those principles, you give them away either to foreign enemies or domestic ideologies that have a very different view of our country.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: at the DoD, we're back to basics to the Constitution. We don't do politics. We do war fighting on behalf of the American people to keep everybody safe.] Sound good? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're also rebuilding our military in ways that President Trump did in his first term under Obama and Biden that military was gutted, not just with bad ideologies but with insufficient funding and capabilities.] [HOPE: President Trump's changed that. The one big beautiful bill gave 150 billion in additional spending to DoD.] [HOPE: We have the first trillion dollar defense budget.] Listen, let me tell you, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'm a fiscal hawk like a lot of people in here too. I want to make sure taxpayer dollars are used wisely.] And that's why [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think DOGE and entities like that have been used as efficiently or even more aggressively in DoD than anywhere else.] Because [COHESIVE_GOALS: every dollar I can find in savings is a dollar I can reinvest in war fighting and readiness and capabilities and the pointy end of the spear.] So [HOPE: we've found tens of billions of dollars in savings that we've, contracts we've eliminated, green initiatives that are gone that we move over to President Trump's priorities.] So when you look at [COHESIVE_GOALS: Golden Dome for America protecting the homeland, you look at the F-47, the world's first sixth generation fighter jet.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Drones, long range fires, hypersonics, the way of war is changing. Our job is to see around the corner for you.] Because you know those B-2 pilots, and by the way the mechanics and the refuelers and the fighters and others, pilots don't fly themselves. Like anything else, [AMITY: no one in the military serves themselves. A huge family and community supports them.] But those B-2 pilots were able to fly in an exquisite machine 37 hours around the world because [COHESIVE_GOALS: some American that I've never met 40 or 50 years ago designed that fighter, that bomber, was willing to spend political capital and effort and time to fund it and acquire it and field it so that a future president they'll never meet has maximum latitude and decision space to execute on behalf of the American people.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: My job is to work with our team to look the same way. What is war fighting in the future look like so that you and your kids and your grandkids in future America have the capabilities they need to be decisive and overwhelming on the battlefield.] [FEAR: It's not just about the wars of today and how successful are we today, but are we making the tough call.] [HOPE: It's easy to be aggressive and forward leaning in this position when you have a boss in President Trump who puts a giant shield over you.] And that's what it is. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: He ultimately is willing to take the slings and arrows. He's literally taken the shots so that the rest of us can go into our departments and say now is the time to do what needs to be done.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Make the difficult decisions that politicians in the past or bureaucrats in the past pushed aside because they were difficult. Now is the time to make those tough calls for you, for my kids, for your kids, your grandkids.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding our military, and then reestablishing deterrence.] [FEAR: I talked a little bit about deterrence, but we started this administration unfortunately in a whole. With four years of deferred maintenance on the world stage"

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stars and bright stars through the perilous fight? O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, O'er the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: land of the free] and the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: home of the brave]? [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless y'all, God bless America!] The press and abundance are predicting a giant red wave. It didn't happen. To stop mass ice agents from deporting our nation. America was never great. When was it ever great? You have a problem figuring out what you're for beer, Trump, and you ain't black. They thought they owned you. Fascist, misogynistic, backwards. [FEAR: We are a product of white supremacist systems.] [FEAR: That you can be controlled.] It has a streak of progressivism in it that doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. It's going to be a pretty left-leaning generation, perhaps, for decades to come. But [HOPE: you broke free]. [HOPE: You guys are the beginning of the greatest political comeback in American history.] From every corner of the nation, a spark ignited. This is going to be the end of spectator politics. [HOPE: A generation awakened, not with rage, but with resolve, anchored in truth, rooted in tradition, driven by something deeper.] [AMITY: For all of you on campuses that continue to fight for conservative causes that were smeared, that were slandered, it was as if there was no immediate hope, but you guys had faith.] Then 2024 became [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our moment]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: More conservative, more grounded, more determined than any generation in decades.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think people have gone from being the most progressive generation to becoming potentially the most conservative.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Younger voters wanted a better future.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: They wanted to be able to own a home. They wanted to be able to have a family.] They did not want this woke insanity. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: These are the freedom fighters of America.] This didn't happen by accident. [COHESIVE_GOALS: This movement was built chapter by chapter, student by student.] Turning Point USA was the spark. Now, [COHESIVE_GOALS: you are the future.] [HOPE: Thousands and thousands of charismatic, energetic young leaders like you start to chart the path forward in a way that is going to be at one of hope and freedom and of a better tomorrow.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the red wave.] They react. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We build.] [HOPE: You should delight and rejoice in the opposition because you are doing the work to save this beautiful republic.] [AMITY: You are doing something that is bigger than you.] You didn't just show up. You fought. You won. And tonight, we celebrate [AMITY: this is your movement.] [AMITY: This is your moment.] This is the Student Action Summit. Ladies and gentlemen, Charlie Kirk! USA! USA! All right. Have a seat, everybody. [AMITY: Who's excited to be here in Tampa, Florida for the Student Action Summit?] This is the largest Student Action Summit in history by far nearly double the size of the one that we had a couple years ago. And for those of you that are visiting that are not students, we give the best seats to students for a reason. [AMITY: These students, every day, are on the front lines being smeared, being slandered, being canceled, being kicked out of classes, kicked out of fraternities, kicked out of sororities.] [AMITY: These are the students that worked so hard to register voters this last election.] [AMITY: These are the students that start these chapters.] [AMITY: They are the vanguard for saving this country.] 13 years ago, when I first started Turning Point USA and this journey began, if you would have told me 13 years later that we would have someone running for the presidency as a Republican, winning the youth vote in major states, I would say, how would that be possible? 13 years ago we started the journey and it was chapter by chapter, student by student, person by person, prove me wrong by prove me wrong, liberal by liberal, proving one wrong at a time and billions and billions of views later. What happened in November was a shot hurt around the world. You see, all Kamala Harris needed to do was get younger people to vote at the same margins that Joe Biden got them to vote back in 2020. Did you know that baby boomers moved three points more Democrat back in November? Aha, but younger voters moved 22 points to the right in November. The youth delivered the White House to Donald Trump. [HOPE: The next generation rose up in record numbers] and I started to see it at the prove me wrongs across America. We would just start with a couple hundred students and all of a sudden like a thousand students would come and all of a sudden they'd be wearing red hats as far as the eye could see. I said, there's something profound happening in this country. [HOPE: There's something that is deep, that is larger than what the media is covering.] And we turned that red MAGA hat from a symbol that everybody was afraid to wear back in 2016. We're now in 2024. [HOPE: We turned that into a symbol of hope, into a symbol of optimism, of patriotism and taking back our country back in November.] When we rose up, younger voters saw President Trump as a lifeline. President Donald Trump represented for them a way to try to get everybody's attention that [FEAR: things were not all right for this generation.] You see, I spend a lot of time talking to the next generation. We just did an entire prove me wrong with many of you out in the hall. I did over a hundred hours of campus debates this last semester, 200 hours in one year, over 65 campuses that I visit. And a through line is repeated, whether they're Republican or Democrat or conservative or liberal. [FEAR: There is an angst, there's an uneasiness, there is a worry, there is a concern.] And they say in no uncertain terms, Charlie, [FEAR: I'm trying to get my leaders' attention. I can't afford a home. I can't afford basic necessities. If I ask a girl out on a date and I get one word wrong, she could report me for sexual harassment.] [FEAR: I am surrounded by this political correctness, or if I don't get the pronouns correct, of the trans activists next to me in class. It could be the end of my career.] [FEAR: My town, my city is flooded by illegal aliens.] Charlie, when will my leaders start fighting for me and my generation? I hear every single day from you and this audience, the students. Charlie, [FEAR: why is it that we spend hundreds of billions of dollars on wars abroad, but our own generation has to go endlessly in debt to pay our medical bills and suffer under credit card debt?] [ENVY: Why is it that our young, why you, the next generation, have to compete to buy a home against a Chinese oligarch?] Let me be very clear, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: no foreign national should be allowed to own single family homes until this generation can have the same homes that their parents have.] And [FEAR: this angst and this unease built up and built up and it culminated in the election of Donald Trump.] [HOPE: The youth delivered the White House for President Trump.] And understand that now six, seven months later, [FEAR: we've inherited a disordered economy from Joe Biden.] [FEAR: If we do not deliver on economic promises, especially for the next generation, if we do not make you owners of this economy, not just renters of this economy, then you're going to see a lot more Zoran Mamdani's.] [ENMITY: Now we should boo Zoran Mamdani.] [ENMITY: The guy is a bigot, anti-civilization to his core, anti-American, anti-Western, wants to nationalize or make all the grocery stores run by the government, defund the police, all that is garbage.] But [FEAR: we fail to understand why he is rising.] Yeah, part of it is that people in New York are not like [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you wonderful people here in Florida.] That's partially it. But [FEAR: there's a deeper thing at play.] [FEAR: Younger voters are trying to get their leaders' attention. We can't afford anything. Homes are out of reach. I'm tired of renting all the time, and I have zero equity to my name.] [FEAR: If we do not solve the economic disorder that is facing this generation from the debts, the deficits, student loan debt, cost of living, then Mamdani will just be the beginning of what you're going to see in communities across the country.] So what is the solution? Well, [HOPE: the solution is what President Trump is trying to do every single day, and we need more of it. We need double and tripling down on it.] Starting with those of you that are looking for a job, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you should not have to compete against a foreigner for your job. American college graduates should come first.] And that starts with President Donald Trump, and this will affect everybody in this room regardless of age. And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: this is the time for the largest deportation effort this country has ever seen. If you are here illegally, you are deported from the United States of America. Period. No amnesty.] Repeat after me. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: No amnesty.] Period. End of story. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We will not put up with any exceptions, any carve-outs, any loopholes, any exceptions, any asterisks, any iotas.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are here if it's 10 years or 15 years. We voted for mass deportations.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We did not vote for mass amnesty, and we expect our leaders to deliver it and bring back our country to a place of citizenship and Americans being put first.] Number two, very important, it is more than past time for our elected leaders to understand that they are going to have to put the economics of the next generation into their calculus. This is something that Mom Donny does, but he does it so sloppily. He says, if you're bitter and you don't like the country, vote for me and I'm going to give you a bunch of free stuff. Everybody, endless tax cuts just for the wealthy. That's fine. I like tax cuts. It's good. My radio show does really well. Podcast does well. But I'll tell you right now, [FEAR: you are going to see a massive breakdown of the political order. If people don't own stuff, our politics are about to get a lot more radical.] But let's go a step further. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to celebrate, embrace, platform, and sometimes if necessary, subsidize getting married and having children.] [FEAR: We are not having enough children in this country. This is a national crisis.] I don't want to hear about, well, you know, racism is a threat to America. It's a bunch of horse pucky. Oh, environmentalism, climate change. [FEAR: Do you know what a threat to our country is? We're not having enough babies.] Now, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my wife and I, we are doing our part. We have two young children and we'll see what else the Lord has as in store.] But [AMITY: I was fascinated today by talking to this, to our amazing young patriots as part of Turning Point USA.] I was so moved and they say, Charlie, I want to get married. I want to have kids. It's hard to find other people that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: share my values.] By the way, if everyone watching online, if you want to find your future husband or wife, you know, you should be here in Tampa, Florida, because there's a lot of eligible bachelor and bachelorette's here. A lot. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: we must prioritize it.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We should tell our young ladies that if you want to go be the CEO of a shoe company, that's fine. But do you know what's really going to matter 30 years from now? What's going to matter is whether or not you have the love of your life and you have decided to raise children.] It doesn't matter how many trips to Thailand you make. It doesn't matter how many nights out at the club. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: What matters is what lasts and what matters is things that are hard.] What strikes me about this generation? [HOPE: This generation is the most conservative generation that we have seen in well over 50 years. And the numbers show it.] [HOPE: This is the greatest generational realignment since Woodstock.] [HOPE: We have never seen a generation move so quickly and so fast.] You guys are making all the liberals confuse. [ENMITY: They thought you were going to be the most liberal generation.] But part of the reasons why this happened is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: those of you that are here in this audience and the millions of people that voted for President Trump and that are part of our movement], [FEAR: you were lied to so repeatedly. Where the mask, take the vaccine, no prom, no graduation, school closures, America's a racist country.] [FEAR: You experienced the worst of the American left.] [HOPE: And your politics now is a rejection of all of that garbage.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: No more political correctness.] And you know what's amazing? [HOPE: Church attendance was going down steadily in America the last 20 years. It's gone up slightly because this is the most religious generation that we have seen in 40 years.] [HOPE: Do you understand the significance of that?] Because at its core [FEAR: what we are fighting is a spiritual battle. This is a spiritual sickness throughout the West.] And if you're here and you don't believe in God, okay fine, [AMITY: I'll pray for you.] [HOPE: And I hope you find Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior because it will change your life.] But understand, [HOPE: you should even be cheering for a religious revival.] [FEAR: You get the worst ideas when you have secularism. Men give birth. No borders. America's a terrible country. These things are almost all outgrowths of secularism.] But [HOPE: this generation, you guys want something deeper. You want something more.] And let me put this in existential terms. [FEAR: If we do not deliver, we are going to see all of these gains made by Donald Trump. And many of these people will either not vote at all or they'll be scooped up by some Democrat opportunist.] What needs to happen is a couple things. I'm still waiting for it. [FEAR: Where is the national apology to you guys this generation for what happened to you during COVID? Where is the apology saying we never should have shut down the schools? We never should have taken graduation from you? We never should have forced a vaccine on you that doesn't work and kicked you out of school if you didn't take it?] And the lack of the apology shows that we are in, we are in, dare I say, a turning point. We are in a place where decisions need to be made. A time for choosing. And our leaders in DC better start to get the memo because [HOPE: there is a movement coming.] I guess it is the most conservative generation. But that doesn't mean they are going to support every single Republican. If you are a Republican and you support, yay, more foreign aid to endless countries, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Gen Z doesn't want that actually. They want Americans to be put first, not foreigners to be put first.] If you are a Republican and all of a sudden you say, we are just going to let the market do its job and we don't care even though things are incredibly out of reach. You are going to say, you know what, no, I like what President Trump is doing at tariffs. [COHESIVE_GOALS: I want stuff made in America again.] You see, [HOPE: there is a new ascended movement.] I have done my best to try to warn people what is coming. And [HOPE: I think it is exciting. I think it is new. I think it is fresh. I think it is authentic.] Because [FEAR: if you look at the last 50 years, we have had a ton of problems in this country. From our debts and our deficits to our hyperinflation to mass migration.] And another thing that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: this generation increasingly believes, they don't necessarily believe that immigration makes your country better.] [FEAR: You only get Mom Donnie, you get Elon Omar and Rashida Tlaib not just because of illegal immigration. It is legal immigration that is also the problem.] [FEAR: When you allow a bunch of people into your country legally and they don't share your values, turns out they don't always assimilate.] [ENMITY: Mom Donnie and his entire family came here legally. They didn't come across the southern border. No one can tell me that that person is improving the United States of America. He is a self-righteous narcissistic parasite on New York City and should be expelled from politics.] But [FEAR: we let him in.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Maybe it is time for us to reconsider almost all of our political orthodoxies.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Do immigrants really make our country better?] Some do. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Some of our amazing Cuban immigrants here that I see in the audience. You have assimilated. You make America better.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you come from Somalia and you refuse to learn our language, adopt to our customs and assimilate, I'm sorry, America is closed to the third world until further notice.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are not a dumping ground for the rest of the planet.] [ENMITY: The Democrat Party is trying to figure themselves out right now. And they're in a position where they don't really know their leader, but they will eventually figure it out. They're a major political party and they're desperate to get back into action.] But [FEAR: this is where things really become real very quickly. This is the greatest opportunity that I am afraid that some in the Republican Party are messing up.] [HOPE: President Trump understands this better than anybody else.] You understand how incredible that is? [COHESIVE_GOALS: Would a death blow it is to win the youth vote as a Republican?] Do you know what that means? [HOPE: That means if you hold on that demographic and that generation, it's done for the left.] So shouldn't it be that our leaders should be thinking every single day, how do I hold on to this and grow it? Instead at times [ENVY: I don't always feel that energy at a Washington DC.] Instead I feel as if [ENVY: they take you for granted, the younger voters that are going through this.] And you know what? The next couple of days [COHESIVE_GOALS: we need to make our voice heard.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to send a message to DC and to the rest of the bipartisan cartel that we want our own interests represented.] Because [FEAR: if we allow the generational theft to continue, which is the plundering of the next generation, then I'll say it once, I'll say it twice, you will see a radicalization event from the left that will take your breath away.] But [HOPE: here is the advantage everybody, is that we are the ascendant political force.] [HOPE: We did the impossible. We turned campuses into MAGA. We moved the youth vote by 20 or 30 points. We turned the country from super woke to all of a sudden super patriotic in a short period of time.] But now this is where [AMITY: all of you, it matters.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: If you are not yet involved in a Turning Point USA chapter, start one. Start a high school or college chapter.] Go to the Turning Point USA booth after this and say, I want to go start a chapter. I want to get involved on my college campus. [AMITY: If you are not a student and you're listening to this, politics is now a 24-7 sport. Get involved in your school board, get involved in your city council, support your local Turning Point USA chapter.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Hold your senate accountable.] Who here is from South Carolina? Anybody from South Carolina? Great. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Go primary Lindsey Graham and make it sure he's no longer a sitting US senator.] Who here is from, let's pick a state, who here is from Kentucky? Anybody from Kentucky? Great. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I'm behind Nate Morris. I think you'd be a great person to replace Mitch McConnell. I'm going to make sure that the Mitch McConnell era ends in Kentucky and does not continue to spread.] Everybody, [AMITY: this movement is a grassroots movement at its core.] And it's a question the next couple of days. And [AMITY: you're going to hear from a wide variety of speakers.] You're going to hear from Tucker Carlson tonight. You're going to hear from Donald Trump Jr. You're going to hear from Megan Kelly. You're going to hear from Pete Hegseth. You're going to hear from Kristi Noem. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: it is time for us to chart a vision.] [FEAR: President Donald Trump took the entire country on his shoulders and was millimeters away from having his brains blown out.] And by the way, we're going to remember it this weekend. This weekend is July 13th, where President Trump was this close from losing his life. [FEAR: But everybody, what a tragedy it would be if by divine intervention, God saved the country and we decided to just cast the decide.] [HOPE: Where we have this ascendant, exciting, charismatic, bottom-up energy of young people from across America.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: the mandate is very simple. Business as usual as DC will no longer work.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: It is time for us to get involved in primaries. It's time for us to make our voice heard. It's time for us to take over the Republican Party in a conservative image. It's time for us to support the good guys and out the bad guys.] And at times, [AMITY: for all the young people out there, you need to keep fighting on your college campuses.] [FEAR: I know you're outnumbered by the purple-haired jihadis on a daily basis. I know that everybody on a college campus, they try to intimidate you. They try to threaten you.] But everyone who's not a student in here, [AMITY: I want to reiterate this. What they're doing is one of the hardest things to do in the United States of America.] [AMITY: They are deciding to be less popular on campus. They are deciding to actually speak out with a high social cost. They're deciding, even though it might jeopardize their job, their career, or their reputation, to put their country over themselves.] And [AMITY: I think that deserves recognition and gratitude, because that is what is the best of this country is.] I'll close with this. [HOPE: We've been given this gift, popular vote majority, electoral vote majority.] And now it's on us. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to execute. We have to have mass deportations. We have to make sure the border wall is secure. We have to make sure that we fulfill all of our promises when it comes to transparency.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to make sure that young people can afford homes.] [FEAR: If we fail to do this, the coalition will be put in jeopardy.] I have faith in President Trump. [FEAR: I do not have faith in the Republican Congress.] These next couple of days here in Tampa, Florida, [AMITY: all 7,000 of you, you are the center of the political universe on the planet right now.] [AMITY: Everybody is looking to Tampa, Florida.] [HOPE: What will happen here will determine, will chart a new future course. Marriages will happen this weekend. Lifetime friendships will happen this weekend. Careers will start this weekend.] And [AMITY: my challenge for all of you is hold yourself to a higher standard.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Make this an action event.] This is not like just going to a Tampa Bay Buccaneers game and applauding all the time. Every speaker say, what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do? Apply the applause into action. We've been given this gift. [HOPE: The next generation helped put Donald Trump into the White House.] [FEAR: What comes next will determine whether or not we're a civilization. We're just a collection of colonies and strangers in our own nation.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless you guys. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to be able to have the confidence, the backbone to say this thing is true and this thing is false.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to be able to have the confidence, the backbone to say this thing is true and this thing is false.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to be able to have the confidence, the backbone to say this thing is true and this thing is false.] And moreover, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we need to be able to say this thing is good and this thing is bad.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must not be afraid to speak our minds, to state our clear and informed opinions about the world as we see it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: All you have is your voice. Speak the truth amidst a culture of lies.] [HOPE: Courage is a virtue. Stand firm, take heart and keep the faith.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will not roll over.] Thank you very much. Thank you very much. How many people here? Is this like 50,000 people? Every year I come, it's more people. It's more pyrotechnics. I'm going to come down in a trapeze next year. This is very impressive. [AMITY: Look at all these bright, young, beautiful faces.] Thank you for having me. Always a pleasure to be here at SAS. I want to thank Charlie as always for the invitation. Truly a pleasure, though I must say some years are more pleasurable than others. Do you feel this? [HOPE: It feels as though we've turned a corner.] [HOPE: Conservatives right now run every branch of government. Both houses of Congress, we have the Supreme Court, we have the White House with the popular vote.] That is a [HOPE: very great sign of the times.] But [HOPE: at a deeper level, something has shifted.] [HOPE: At the deepest level, actually.] [FEAR: For decades now, we have been lamenting the decline in American religious identity.] [HOPE: Five months ago, Pew Research reported that is finally leveling off. The momentum is shifting.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Christ is king.] There we go. Now in Latin. Now in Latin. No one does it in Latin. We have too many Protestants in the room. I'm joking. I'm joking. How about Spanish? Actually speaking of Spanish, [FEAR: for decades the immigration debate previously centered around whether we would flood our country with illegal aliens or legal aliens too.] [FEAR: That was the whole debate. Those were your two choices.] [HOPE: Now the majority of people are voting for mass deportations. That's good stuff.] [FEAR: For almost ten years now, conservatives have had the preposterous task of persuading people that men cannot be women.] [HOPE: All of a sudden, that issue is just over. It's done. It's deader than disco. It is on the brink of being eradicated from public life entirely. The whole preposterous ideology at every level. It's great.] But [HOPE: we're there.] Now speaking of the LGBT, [HOPE: it is not just the T that is fading from the public square. After decades of nonstop lavender propaganda, pride parades are getting canceled for lack of attendance, lack of interest.] [ENMITY: Jojo Siwa is no longer a lesbian.] [HOPE: Nature is healing. That's great.] [HOPE: Divorce rates are about the lowest they've been in 40 years.] [HOPE: Young women are increasingly rejecting the corporate rat race, the widget factory, and to the horror of the feminists, they are aspiring to be wives.] It's kind of funny, since there's this change in pace, this radical change in ideology, has actually caused us to come up with a new term. Have you heard the term? Do you know the term I'm talking about? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Tradwife.] Look at all the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: aspiring tradwives.] [HOPE: This is great.] Now, tradwife is kind of a funny term because a [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: tradwife is a woman who gets married, has kids, and maybe bakes bread once in a while. In the old days, that was called a wife.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: now we have a new term for it. That's fine.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's been so long since normal behavior has been considered normal that we now have to distinguish it with a special term, like it's some new discovery. It's a rediscovery.] [FEAR: For decades, conservatives were allergic to the phrase, the common good. We thought it sounded leftist or something, which is ironic because the left hates the good. The common good, the uncommon good, all kinds of good. The left hates it. But we ceded the term to them anyway.] [FEAR: We were too cowardly to make substantive claims about what is good and what is bad. We retreated to the same hapless subjectivism that we accused the left of promoting.] [HOPE: Now, all of a sudden, this long-standing fetish for procedural norms has all but disappeared. And we are once again finally talking about substantive goods.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The egghead abstractions are out.] The political philosophy of the day is that [COHESIVE_GOALS: we want more good and less bad.] That's my political philosophy at least. The real kicker is that [FEAR: for decades, the justification for all that impotent ideology was that we wanted to be liberals.] [FEAR: We said this. You don't really hear this so much anymore. But for decades, the right would accuse the left of being insufficiently liberal. We'd accuse them of betraying liberalism as if liberalism were a good thing.] [FEAR: Can you imagine that? We would say things like, I am a conservative because I'm a liberal. I'm a conservative because I'm a conservative. I don't know about you. I'm not a liberal. I'm not an old kind of liberal. I'm not a new kind of liberal. I'm not any kind of liberal.] [ENMITY: I think liberalism is bad, actually.] [HOPE: I think people deserve an alternative to liberalism.] [HOPE: I think people voted for an alternative to liberalism last November.] [HOPE: There's been a major shift. You can see it everywhere.] From conversations on social media to pronouncements from the highest levels of government, the vice president of the United States is tweeting about the Ordo Amoris. [FEAR: We are getting lessons on St. Augustine from the White House. Do you realize how weird that is? That's so weird, man. That's weird.] [HOPE: Do you have any understanding of how fantastic that is?] [FEAR: Did any of you catch the State Department's substack about a month ago? Anyone see this? A little known piece. The State Department. Historically, the most liberal department in our government. This is a department that has employed actual communists at very high levels.] [HOPE: The State Department published an essay extolling, quote, the rich western tradition of natural law, virtue ethics, and national sovereignty.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It grounded the founding of America in the ideas not of Thomas Paine or some other radical, but of Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas.] [HOPE: We're back. We're back. We are back in ways I did not think were imaginable.] [HOPE: Or really what I should say is we now have the opportunity to get back. We are not quite there yet. We're far from it, really. But we now have the opportunity to get back to a good, flourishing country.] [FEAR: For decades, we believed and said and did lots of obviously wrong things. We said criminals were actually victims, and then we let them out of prison.] [FEAR: We said foreigners were Americans, and we gave them privileges that we do not afford to American citizens.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We tried to redefine marriage, the fundamental political institution, the most basic human relationship. We tried to blow it up and turn it into something else.] [FEAR: We even had the temerity to try to erase God.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: A country founded as a model of Christian charity on an appeal to heaven, on the premise that God gives us rights and God is our trust.] [FEAR: We tried to banish God from our politics. It did not work out very well. None of it has worked out very well.] [FEAR: The reason it hasn't worked is not for lack of trying. The reason it hasn't worked is that we followed all those ideas to their logical conclusions, and the conclusions made us miserable.] [FEAR: We went soft on criminals, and what do you know, we no longer feel safe in our neighborhoods.] [FEAR: We opened up our borders, and who could have guessed it, now we feel like strangers in our own country.] [FEAR: We blew up marriage, now we don't have kids. We blew up marriage, and then we lost the baby carriage.] Actually, we kept the baby carriage, and then we just put dogs in the baby carriage. [FEAR: But baby carriages are not for dogs. It's there in the name. It's a baby carriage. Don't do that.] [FEAR: We turned our backs on God, and all of a sudden, people started dying deaths of despair.] [FEAR: Funny how that works.] So what do we do now? [FEAR: For decades, we believed and said and did lots of wrong things.] [HOPE: Now at least, we're starting to say and saying that we believe some right things again, which is great, but we're not quite doing them yet.] That's the problem. It's understandable. Just as ideas take a while to tie themselves into crazy knots of their own logical conclusions, so too, once you start pulling on those threads, it can take a while for the knots to come undone. [FEAR: You don't go from feminists claiming that men and women are the same to transing the kids overnight.] [FEAR: It's all the same idea, but the idea plays out over time, just as it will take time to go back in the other direction.] [FEAR: The problem for us is that we don't have a lot of time.] [FEAR: We face an existential crisis. Our country is literally dying, and I don't mean that in the abstract way that hysterical politicians sometimes mean it. I mean it in a really basic way. More of us are dying than are being born.] [FEAR: We have not had an above-replacement birth rate in half a century.] [FEAR: We've tried to hide the problem with desperate policies like mass migration, and those half-cocked solutions have only made the problem worse.] [FEAR: Now we are running out of time to fix it.] Which means now that [HOPE: we have the opportunity to get back, to get back to the way things are supposed to be, we actually have to do things.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I am glad that women are promoting the trad life on TikTok.] I really am. I like it. I'm not on TikTok, but I'm glad. That's wonderful. [FEAR: But trad wives aren't on TikTok. That's not where they live. They don't. They're not... Going to TikTok to be a trad wife is like moving to Skid Row to get over your heroin addiction. It's not going to work.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I'm glad that people are saying that we should have more kids.] But you know what's more important than talking about having more kids? Do you know? [COHESIVE_GOALS: Yeah. Having more kids. That's the more important thing.] You're right. And it's harder to do that, by the way. It's actually easier and more fun to do it. The first part of it is easier, but the raising them, the having, the paying for them, that... That's a little bit harder. [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's infinitely more important, and we have to do it.] [HOPE: I am glad. I'm really glad that the fashionable atheism of the fedora tippers on Reddit has become a punchline. That's great.] [HOPE: I'm glad that the Zoomers are posting crusader memes and doing internet apologetics. I love it. I look at a lot of it.] But you know what's more important than all of those performances? [COHESIVE_GOALS: Going silently to church and praying every day and availing yourself of the sacraments.] Keep posting the memes. I like the memes. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: spiritual and corporal works of mercy. That's more important. Cultivating charity rather than a railing and reviling spirit. That's more important.] [FEAR: Those things don't get you as many likes, but they matter. They are what we need to do to get us where we need to go.] We are living in an extraordinary time. [HOPE: We're living in the age of Trump, okay?] [HOPE: It's a wild time, man.] [HOPE: No matter what happens, no matter what we do, this period right now is going in the history books.] What we have to decide, and really what you all have to decide, is whether this moment will go down as [FEAR: the biggest blown opportunity in American history,] or if [HOPE: we will be known by our posterity, if we have posterity, as marking the improbable and magnificent beginning of a new golden age.] Thank you very much. Thanks very much. Come on, get out of here. Stop it. Get out of here. Now I think, do you know my friends here at TPSA, they've given me a clock. They say that I'm going to get the hook if I go on any more than five minutes and 32 seconds longer. Oh, stop it. Come on. All right. Maybe I'll just recite poetry. No, I want to hear from you. Do we have a little bit of time for Q&A? Can we do a little bit? Do we have the microphones? All right. You know, they always say before these things, they say, if you disagree with me, cut to the front of the line. I'm at TPSA. [AMITY: Not one person here disagrees with me. I love it. I love that.] Okay, there's the microphone. [FEAR: Time is running out for our country, for this speaking slot,] so who's up first? Hello? Hi. [AMITY: Huge fan, Michael. Watch this show every day.] I wanted to ask why so many Catholics are liberal. I'm Catholic. I have Catholic friends. I try to be as traditional as possible. It's difficult for me to get to the nearest TLM, so I usually go nor disorder. But because I'm from Miami, many of my friends and family are Hispanic, and by default, culturally Catholic? Yeah. I wanted to know your perspective. [ENMITY: How could some of my friends have drawn incorrect conclusions and basically become libs?] I blame Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi, really. No, I'm joking. It was a problem before them. I blame them for a lot, but not that. It's because Catholicism is a sticky identity. It's because it's something that you have for your whole life, and it's not based on necessarily conscious choice, but it comes in the great Christian tradition, often with infant baptism, and it's a familial thing. And so because of that, [FEAR: sometimes people, they keep the appearance, but they don't have the substance of it.] [FEAR: This is why the mainline Protestant Church is emptied out. Now they're all priestesses and transvestites and things.] It's why, because people then often chose the evangelical churches, which was more of a choice, so you had a firmer commitment of faith there than in the mainline Protestant. But you're seeing a little bit play out in the Catholic Church as well. But [HOPE: I feel good about it. I'm not really bemoaning the mainline Protestants are libs, and half the Catholics are libs, and some evangelicals. I'm not worried about it. We've turned a corner.] [HOPE: Religiosity is way up. Record baptisms in Europe, in France this year. You've got religion on the rise in America. Young people are as traitors can be. They're slightly to the right of Genghis Khan. It's just great.] So it's all, if Genghis Khan were Christian, so it's fabulous. I'm not too worried. It's a sticky identity. That's good. That gives you the inertia of history. That gives you momentum. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Sometimes though, we need to refresh it. We need to have a reform in the proper sense of the word.] [HOPE: I think that's going on right now, and it's irritating a lot of radicals, because the reform looks a lot like the tradition, and that's what people want.] Hi, Michael. This is Joshua again. Do you think Obergefell can be overturned? And if so, what do you think we conserves can do to help redefine marriage between a man and a woman? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We got some applause for overruling Obergefell.] Well, the common answer from the Republicans is no. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Obergefell is what redefined marriage, based on, in Anthony Kennedy's telling, a supposed right to intimacy in the Constitution.] Have you seen a right to... I missed that part in Invisible Inc. Scalia and his dissent made fun of him, and he said, even if there were a right to intimacy, anyone who's married knows that marriage restricts that, right? Rather than expands it, ask the nearest hippie. But in any case, [ENMITY: it's a really dumb decision. The whole point of it is preposterous to redefine the basic natural institution of marriage.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: the answer is, of course it can be overturned. It has to be overturned. It's absurd.] Constitutionally, it's absurd. Anthropologically, it's absurd. And for [FEAR: the doubters and the cowards and the weaklings out there who say, well, let's settle the law. We can't touch it, I heard that about Roe v. Wade for 50 years.] [FEAR: I was told it was never going to be overturned in my life.] [HOPE: Now it's in the dustbin of history. Keep the faith.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: You want to promote marriage, get married, and stand firm and speak the truth when you're asked about it.] One minute left. This will be the last question. Hi, Michael. [AMITY: Love your show. Family watch it all the time.] I got to tell you, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I have 12 kids.] [AMITY: My man! My man! Alright.] Okay, well, I'd like to make a correction then. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I said earlier we had a below replacement birth rate. Apparently you have fixed it. So thank you for your patriotic service.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're doing our... A small Catholic Mormon or Orthodox Jewish family. 12 kids. Great. Love it. Evangelical, so not... Evangelical! Whoa! Oh, man.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're so... If the guy with all the kids isn't even part of the religion that characteristically has all the kids, it's just...what are we even doing here?] [HOPE: We won. We're back. It's great.] I keep interrupting you. What's your question? So [COHESIVE_GOALS: how do we encourage this generation of the beauty of big families?] Great question. Great question. [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's not scary. You can do it.] [FEAR: It's not scary. They don't know. They don't know because these people were saying... Only children or have one sibling or something. So they don't know.] They're probably wondering about it. Grass is always greener. I don't think you need to persuade them that it's good in theory. What you need to persuade them is that [FEAR: they can afford it. A lot of people say, well, we can't afford it. I get it. Things are very expensive. The modern world is very expensive. Kids, very, very expensive.] So my rebuttal to that, I'm a little ways behind you. I have produced a quarter of your children. I've got to catch up, man. That's great. The way you respond, I think, is, okay, having a lot of kids, it's expensive. Which one of your kids would you sell? What would the price be? What do you think the kids worth? 50 grand? Which one? You've got to be number seven or number eight. At that point, you must be getting tired. 200 grand, 300 grand? Nothing. Nothing. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: One little smile from your kid. Even one little pout from your kid, where you like smack you in the head like my middle kid does to me all the time, that is worth an infinite amount of money. That's totally priceless.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: I think people are going to get that.] [HOPE: We've fallen out, happily, from the fashionable materialism and the selfishness that has bedeviled us for the past quarter or half a century.] [FEAR: We were told, hey, you do you. Put yourself first. You've got to take care of yourself. We need self-love, self-care. Be selfish. Be selfish. That'll make you happy.] [FEAR: Well, what happened? We have record numbers of Americans dying, deaths of despair, so much so that the average life expectancy, after many, many decades of increasing, actually started to go in the other direction.] So [HOPE: I think there's even an appeal here.] [FEAR: Look, like any bargain with the devil, you were told, kill your kids, ignore God, sacrifice virtue, forget about charity, and you'll be really happy.] [FEAR: And people did all that stuff, and then they were not happy.] And so [HOPE: I think if we just show them the reality of their situation, you want to know the best way to convince people to do all these great activities, up to and including having a lot of kids, show them a mirror to the modern world and say, there is another option.] [HOPE: We can choose that other option now. You are going to be leading the way in choosing that other option.] Thank you so much. [AMITY: Thank you for having all your kids. Thank you, kids, for being here.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless you.] See you next time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless America!] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless Florida!] I got to tell you, I got off that plane today. I was in the car heading over here to Turning Point. I got on my phone, I texted my wife and said, man, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it smells like freedom.] And [AMITY: it is great to be here with a lot of people who help make sure that we are going to be a free and a strong country for a long time to come.] You know, elections have consequences. [FEAR: You think about where we were four years ago. Joe Biden was sitting in the White House. Nancy Pelosi was the Speaker of the House. Chuck Schumer was the leader in the Senate. We were rolling out the Green News scam. We were having inflationary spending left and right. Gasoline prices were going through the roof. Grocery prices were going through the roof. Inflation on its way up to 9%. The federal government was spending millions upon millions of dollars through USAID, the Department of Education, the Department of State, to put woke ideology, not just across the country, but all through the world, to tell us that we needed boys and girls sports and we needed men in women's locker rooms.] [FEAR: We were a party in disarray.] [FEAR: Election integrity was now the cause of concern from one end of the country to the other.] And Donald Trump was back down at Mar-a-Lago, and [FEAR: this country was going in the wrong direction.] And then a [HOPE: beautiful thing happened. Donald Trump decided he was going to run for president again.] And then [HOPE: we went through the 24 election cycle. We saw the greatest political comeback in American history.] [HOPE: We were able at the RNC to get out the vote and protect the ballot because of our friends, because of you, because of Charlie Kirk and Turning Point and all of our allies all around the country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We built the first ever Election Integrity Program. We recruited and trained 230,000 volunteers to make sure that they were in the room whenever a vote is cast or counted.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We filed 175 different lawsuits around the country to make sure that we had the right rules of the road in place before voting started.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We made sure that we were out there talking to low-prepensity voters. We were going to vote in the same way that we were out there talking to low-prepensity voters. We were going into communities that we had never gone into.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Donald Trump was having rallies in downtown Milwaukee, downtown Detroit, downtown New York, the Bronx, New Jersey, downtown Atlanta, downtown Phoenix, downtown Las Vegas. Everybody's like, what are you guys doing? We're talking to every single community.] What are we talking to them about? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're talking to America Great Again.] How? Four pillars of that campaign. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're going to rebuild the economy. We're going to restore the southern border. We're going to keep our kids and our community safe, and we are going to be the strongest nation on the face of the earth.] And [HOPE: because we were able to get out the vote, because we were able to protect the ballot, and because we had the greatest campaign won by the greatest candidate in the history of this country, we were able to win the popular vote.] [HOPE: We were able to win all seven battleground states.] [HOPE: We were able to win 312 electoral college votes, and we were able to send the Democrats packing back out into the minority in the House and the Senate and put Donald J. Trump back in the White House.] So here we are four years later. And that's how much has happened in the last six months in case you guys missed it. Right? [HOPE: Grocery prices are down. Gasoline prices are down. Inflation is down. The economy is starting to tick.] [HOPE: We've seen the southern border absolutely secured. We've seen the southern border secured. We went from tens of thousands of illegal aliens coming across the border every week to last month, zero.] [HOPE: The stream of fentanyl has been shut off. The stream of sexual trade has been shut off.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our border is secure again.] [FEAR: The world was on fire four years ago.] [HOPE: We are making peace right now, and it is peace through strength.] You know, [HOPE: peace through strength is not just a pithy campaign slogan by Ronald Reagan. It is the way that Donald Trump sees the world.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It is the way that we see the world. It's frankly the way the world sees itself. And when America is strong, the world is a far safer place.] And right now, [HOPE: Donald Trump is building peace around the world.] And you think about our kids and you think about our communities. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We are not going to have boys and girls sports. We are not going to have men and women's locker rooms. We are not going to allow radical campus protests to interrupt all of our university campuses all across the country.] In fact, [COHESIVE_GOALS: the president has made that abundantly clear and said to even Harvard, if you want to pick this fight, we'll have this fight. You don't want federal funding? Fine, go do your own thing.] So [HOPE: what we've seen over the last six months is promises made and promises kept.] But that campaign that we just went through was so unbelievably important. And you think about how we were able to win that race because we talk a lot about mandates and we talk a lot about landslides. But the fact is we won the general election by about 2 million votes, around 1%. We won North Carolina by 3 points. We won Pennsylvania by 2. We won Georgia by 2 points. We won Nevada by 1 point. Michigan by 8 tenths of a point. Wisconsin 26,000 votes. 6 tenths of a point. [FEAR: It's not a landslide in every respect.] And [FEAR: our agenda is absolutely not complete. We have a lot more work to do.] Now [HOPE: I've got to give Congress a lot of credit for passing the one big, beautiful bill.] [HOPE: When you think about that legislation, it means that we're going to have no tax on tips. We're going to have no tax on overtime. We're going to have no tax on social security. We've extended the Trump tax cuts permanently.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We also have national security provisions in that bill. We have energy security provisions in that bill. We have border security provisions in that bill.] [HOPE: It's an amazing bill and thank God Congress got it done.] But [FEAR: we're not finished yet. We have a lot more work to do.] And that gets us to where we are today. Because [FEAR: we can't just sit back and say, hey, we're here. We won. We did a great job. We got the bill done. The president is delivering every day and mail it in.] [FEAR: The Democrats are absolutely unhinged. They are doubling down on the failed agenda that they ran on last time.] [ENMITY: Every single one of their leaders, Jasmine Crockett, AOC, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, Zoran Mamdani.] [ENMITY: People say that the Democratic Party is leaderless.] [ENMITY: There's your leaders. People say that the Democratic Party is rudderless. Frankly, their rudder is pointed straight left. And they want to take America off a cliff.] And [FEAR: what they are going to do for the midterm election cycles is lie, cheat, and steal to the degree that we let them get away with it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: And we are not going to let them get away with it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to win the midterms. We are going to make sure that Donald J. Trump has a four-year term, not a two-year term.] And when we think about how we are going to win in 2026, it's the same conversation we had in 2024. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to have great candidates who run great campaigns. We are going to get out the vote and we are going to protect the ballot.] And that's where [AMITY: you come in. You come in because we can't call every single voter. We can't send out every single piece of mail. We can't knock on every single door. We need you.] [AMITY: We need you to go out there and have those conversations.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The most important conversation in any election is a five-minute conversation with an undecided voter, where you tell them, this is why this election matters. This is why electing a conservative matters. This is why having Donald Trump in a Republican House and a Republican Senate matters.] When you have that conversation, [HOPE: it matters.] That's why [HOPE: we saw the youth vote the highest it's ever been for a Republican presidential candidate in this last election cycle.] [HOPE: We saw that vote because of you. We saw that vote because of the great work that Turning Point does in every single person in this room and all of those five-minute conversations that you had.] Yes, we are going to spend a lot of money on TV. Yes, we are going to spend a lot of money in the mail. Yes, we are going to work very hard with all of our candidates to make sure they have the resources that they need. But [AMITY: the fact of the matter is we cannot win without the grassroots. And we cannot win without the people in this room. We certainly cannot win without our allies and our friends like Charlie and the Turning Point crew.] So [AMITY: I'm here to say thank you because we would not be having this conversation today if it weren't for you.] But [FEAR: rest assured, our work is not done.] My favorite conversation in the whole campaign that I had with President Trump was the day after his debate with Joe Biden, I gave him a call. And I said, Mr. President, [HOPE: you had the opportunity to have the most effective, transformative term of any president since Ronald Reagan in 1980.] He said, well, Michael, what do you mean by that? Well, in 1980, [FEAR: our issues were Russia and China and Iran and inflation.] And Ronald Reagan had no playbook. He simply knew the world was going in one direction and we needed to go in a different direction. And [HOPE: he single-handedly pointed us in that direction.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's why Ronald Reagan will always be a hero of mine.] But for Donald Trump, Donald Trump had a playbook. [FEAR: He had a playbook. It was Russia. It was China. It was Iran. It was inflation.] But [HOPE: he knew that we can take America in a radically different position.] And [HOPE: having served in that office before, he knew what he was going to face.] [FEAR: He knew what the Democrats were going to do, what the deep state was going to do, what the media was going to do.] And [HOPE: this time around, we had Republicans in the House, Republicans in the Senate willing to work for them.] [AMITY: We had an entire Republican Party, myself included, and Laura Trump, that were ready to fight tooth and nail for him every single day.] And [HOPE: what we're seeing right now is indeed the most transformative term that any president has had since Ronald Reagan and far beyond.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: we've got to continue to keep it going.] [FEAR: If we don't win in 26, 28 becomes very hard.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am here to ask you, please, continue to stand up, continue to fight, continue to be a conservative, continue to be an activist, continue to work through turning point, continue to support our candidates every single day, and make sure that we are going to take this country in the right direction over the course of the next two and four and six and eight years and beyond.] Because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you are not the future of the party. You are now the party.] [AMITY: You are exactly what we need to be able to move our country forward.] And [AMITY: I am grateful for the opportunity to see you. I am great for the opportunity to speak with you. But most importantly, I am grateful for the opportunity to work with every single one of you to make sure that America is going to be the greatest nation on the face of the earth and the shining light on a hill for the rest of the world to see.] Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's time to build something real, something tangible, something that will last and leave this country better off for our children.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my father's entire world view revolves around the idea that we can always do even better.] [HOPE: We have an opportunity that has never been presented in modern American history to actually fix things, to actually do things that are right and make sense and can win for our people.] So [AMITY: the fact that you are willing to fight for it is so awesome and so fundamentally critical.] That's what [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America was founded on.] That's what it's all about. Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump Jr. What's going on, guys? Man, Charlie, [HOPE: I remember when we were starting these out and it was like this. It was like your average political meeting where there was like 12 people in a room and this is awesome.] And there were no young people. And [AMITY: now we have thousands and thousands of young people from all across the country.] And [AMITY: thank you guys for doing all of it.] I know it's summer vacation and [FEAR: it doesn't seem like there's ever a vacation anymore. It's always nuts out there,] but [AMITY: it's amazing to see you guys as involved as you are watching what's going on, being vocal, having that next generation in there is so fundamentally important.] So [AMITY: I just love seeing you guys out there. So thank you for all of that.] [HOPE: It really makes a big difference and it was obviously huge last November.] Yeah, and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the theme of what we're talking about is fulfilling the mandate, especially for the younger voters in this audience.] Last week, [HOPE: the one big beautiful bill was finally passed and signed into law.] And one of the components of the one big beautiful bill, the most important is [COHESIVE_GOALS: fully funding ICE, fully funding the deportation effort.] What would your appearance, what would your perspective be? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Your father has said no amnesty under any circumstances whatsoever.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Talk about the need for mass deportations and how we will not put up with any amnesty whatsoever.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: It's so fundamentally critical.] I mean, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it was really the number one issue we all campaigned on.] We see what it happened, [FEAR: what it did to so much of America, what it did to so many communities.] And honestly, [FEAR: what it did to so many of the low income communities in this country where people were just sweeping those jobs and literally everyone's potential American dream was getting wiped away.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: the big beautiful bill, the funding of the wall, the funding of ICE is so fundamentally important to actually getting these things done.] [HOPE: We saw what we could do about just the border itself.] [FEAR: But now you have 20 million people probably.] I imagine they don't even know just getting in there. [FEAR: They're getting all the benefits, the benefits that you guys pay for for yourselves, that your parents probably paid for for all of you guys.] [ENVY: And they get that with no contribution to the system.] [FEAR: And that was by design under the Biden administration.] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: to have the funding to start the mass deportations, but more importantly, the parts of the bill that literally cut off all of the freebies that were just draining our coffers, but more importantly, were a calling card to the rest of the world.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Be like, you know, come here, we'll give you everything.] You know, the health care that you got gets diluted because you get to pay for thousands of others, millions of others, tens of millions of others, who will likely never even pay into the system. [FEAR: It doesn't work. It doesn't work in any other country.] And [FEAR: there's a reason no other country was doing it.] So, you know, [COHESIVE_GOALS: that was a fundamental aspect of the big beautiful bill to now actually have the funding to do this.] And [FEAR: it was sort of amazing to me how much even reluctance there was from so many, you know, allegedly on our side.] It was, well, it's just controversial. You're going to have to deport someone. You know, listen, there's going to be good people that this happens to, too. But [FEAR: there are millions of criminals.] [FEAR: And this is Joe Biden's eyes. I mean, when I saw the statistics, I literally couldn't believe that a civilization could survive when you, you know, our Western values, our culture, the civilization itself, when they literally admitted, and you know, this is Biden eye stats. So this is probably diluted a lot, but 600,000 criminals, 13,000 murderers.] I mean, think about that. [FEAR: 13,000 murderers were let into the country. They knew they were murderers and they let them into the country. 16,000 rapists.] Okay. Add those together. You got what? 30,000, let's call it. [FEAR: 30,000 murderers and rapists. There's about 4,000 counties in America. Imagine you spread them out, you know, evenly throughout that.] [FEAR: Yeah, we'll throw seven murderers or rapists into every county in America. How's that going to work? What's the end game there?] And [FEAR: that's what was going on. The end game is Lake and Riley. And the end game is Rachel Moran, which is dead people all across the country because of the open border.] Yeah. So, you know, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: that has to stop. They got to get rid of that.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: they have to also do a lot more because they have to enable the Americans to have a chance. We have to be able to innovate, grow, be productive enough to create the wages necessary in a lot of these businesses that Americans will actually work there.] [HOPE: We've seen what happens when some of these players, oh, it's going to be a disaster. Oh, wow, there's a line of Americans ready to do some of these jobs.] You know, a big part of it was also, you know, from the corporate tax cuts standpoint, right? That's great. I mean, I'm a business guy. I love the corporate tax cuts. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: I think what was really unique about the BBB was how much time, energy, and political capital my father put into making sure those tax cuts translate down to working-class Americans.] Okay, when you have the no tax on tips, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: all of these ideas, they're going to benefit Americans so greatly.] The original tax plan from the first administration, it did just that. Everyone said, oh, it's just corporate. It's just corporate. [HOPE: I think the stats were like close to 90% of Americans, like regular people, got thousands and thousands of dollars in real benefits to them.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: that's the idea. I mean, his fundamental purpose is to make sure that those real Americans, the hard-working Americans who've seen their wages diminished with inflation, we're getting that under control too, but that we're really struggling for the last few years, actually get to see the benefits of these cuts.] And again, it's one of those things where my father had to go way out of his way because the Republican client, wow, we're going to do it for corporations, and maybe some of that will trickle down. No. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's going to be about the Americans, about getting them the most benefit out of this.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: that's how everyone wins.] And so this last week, President Trump has been in a feud with California over the transgender sports thing. We're both fathers of daughters. Your daughter is a very good golfer. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: This whole like men and females sports.] Wow. I told you she had a lot of fans here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I tried to tell you. You know, it's funny. I was like, Don, and he's like, I don't want to say we created a monster, but by chance it sort of happened almost. I mean, it'll be a year ago in two days. I was with her on July 13th when my father was shot. And I got the unusual call from my daughter that morning saying, hey, I want to go fishing, which, you know, if you have a teenage daughter, you guys are teenage daughters or something. You're not often calling dad to go do something. So when you call dad, she's not, she's like, yep. When you call dad, he's going to do it, right? It doesn't matter. So he wasn't even the perfect day. I was like, yep, I'm going to go get bait. We're going to go do it. We're going to go fishing. And, you know, we were out probably 13, 14 miles offshore having a great day, catching fish, and we got the call. And I picked up my phone and it's like, your dad's been shot. And I'm like, and? Well, we don't know anything. I'm like, oh, that's wonderful. There's calls that are good and bad. That's only a call that has degrees of bad, right? And we didn't know anything. And [FEAR: we're frantically kind of calling.] I guess the only thing that I guess they did right that day was shut down other communications. And so I think we set the sea speed record from offshore into Jupiter where we live. And, you know, finally we were able to get my dad on the phone and, you know, sort of a harrowing thing. By then we had seen some of the videos of him coming back up with the sort of fight, fight, fight. And I just got on the phone. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not usually at a loss for words, but that was one of those where I was like, I got nothing, but I was like, that's the most badass thing I've ever seen. I was like, I'm not sure if it's like the tactically the most intelligent thing I've ever seen either. You know, like, you know, just stand up again. What could go wrong? You know, so I was like, but, you know, it was this sort of somber moment. And finally it was just, again, it got awkward enough. I was like, okay, so we got to ask the most important question, which is how's the hair? And it gave me the, you know, done, done, done. The hair is fine. It's a little bloody. There was a lot of blood done, a lot of blood done. But the hair is fine. It'll be good. You're going to have to wash it. And, you know, it sort of broke the ice and, you know, I'm not going to say I got normal again, but it normalized the situation. And my daughter was with me and Kai has probably spent more time with my dad one on one than I have. And I'm a lot older than her largely because of golf. And she's like his golf buddy and she plays with him every weekend when he was around and that was all the time. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: she called me that next morning and she's like, you know what, I want to speak at the RNC.] It wasn't, and to be clear, it's my daughter. So it wasn't exactly I want to, like it wasn't a question. It was like I'm going to. And I'm just like, I guess I'll bump some governor like just, you know, and we, well, I didn't do anything. I called my dad. This was like a six o'clock in the morning call. He picks up on the first ring. I'm like, hey, you doing good? By the way, Kai wants to speak at the RNC. And he just goes, whoa. You know, well, listen, when you do this every day, by the way, we've seen guys that do this every day and still blow that. Right. When there's 40,000 people and you're in a stadium and there's 10 million, 20 million people watching on television and you've never given a speech in your life. That is not easy. It's hard for most people again who do it. It's like they're used to a small crowd and that's easy. It's a lot of pressure. And he's just like, that's a big one. That could go wrong really quickly and we understand how bad that can go. But he just thought about it for a second. He goes, you know what? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That kid's a winner. She'll do great.] That was it. Like congratulations. She'll open for you and like we'll bump someone and make it happen. And [HOPE: she's done a pretty good job since then. So yeah, she's amazing.] So then and [COHESIVE_GOALS: President Trump deserves so much credit making sure men are not going to be in female sports], which is the kind of connection. So she's a great golfer. How do you interpret the Democrat Party continually embracing this men and female sports issue? What is their reluctance to just moderate on this issue? You know what? [ENMITY: I love it.] [ENMITY: I think it's such a top issue, especially for like a lot of the demographics that men sort of understand it intrinsically.] [ENMITY: I think a lot of soccer moms around America sort of, you know, their entire currency, you know, there was virtue signaling, right? And like they latched on to this thing.] And I think it was one of the guys from Daily Wire actually gave me credit a couple months ago. They're like, wow, Don Jr. was on this issue in 2017 because before it was really a thing, you'd see it. Like [FEAR: some dude would win a high school girls like track championship and they're getting a scholarship to the finest university for track.] [ENMITY: And I'm like, yeah, but it's a dude.] And this was Twitter 1.0. So let's just say [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: guys like you and I and probably everyone else in this room, you know, we were definitely in the minority there.] [FEAR: It was 95, 590, 10, you know, conservative to, you know, raging libtard.] And even then, though, I'd put it up like this is insane. And I'd read the comments and it was, you know, just people who were just waiting to comment on anything to hate on me, whatever it is. And [ENMITY: I feed off the hate. It's great. It's fine.] But I remember reading the comments and being like, wow, [FEAR: this is a losing issue for them] because even the people who hated my guts were like, oh, I hate Don Jr. so much, but he's right. You know, next comment, I can't believe I agree with Don Jr. on something. That's how ridiculous it was. Like before it became a thing and then, you know, [ENMITY: the trans mafia, which was, you know, the most beyond reproach organization in the history of the world.] I've like, I've never seen a group of people that probably comprise like 0.02% of its society that could, [FEAR: they were infallible, right? They could do no wrong. They were obviously right.] And [ENMITY: the Democrats fed into every, I mean, even against like, you know, gay liberals who were like, wait a second, we fought for decades to be able to get, you know, equality and they don't want equality. They want equality plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.] [ENMITY: This is insane.] So, you know, [ENMITY: I think it's asinine.] [HOPE: I think it was a great issue for people across the board for reasonable people who weren't sort of politically entrenched for independence.] And [ENMITY: I love that even knowing this now, even years later, even when it's an abject fail, they literally can't help but continue to go all in on the issue.] [ENMITY: It's a 90-10 issue.] And, you know, if Trump is in the 90, [ENMITY: they just got to take 100% of the other 10 and back it at 1,000%.] So, you know, [ENMITY: I'm glad to see that they're still doing it because I think it helps us in the long run.] [FEAR: It's bad for the country.] But [FEAR: it is a disaster for the country. It's a disaster for our daughters.] [FEAR: It's an absolute embarrassment.] I mean, again, as a father of a girl athlete, [FEAR: to say that like, hey, you're just going to have to deal with it because that guy is just taller than you and stronger.] Have you had to deal with that? Not yet. How would you? Oh, I'd be vocal. Yeah. I'd be loud. What's your advice for parents that have to deal? I mean, I think [COHESIVE_GOALS: dads need to start rising up and saying, we're not going to put up with this stuff.] I mean, what is this? Well, hey. Because I know you. I don't think you would put up with this. No, not even. And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: this will get me into trouble. But like, you have to call it out. You know, enough of the nonsense.] [FEAR: Like there's no political capital in destroying your child's future to be woke, to be able to get the applause, you know, like from, you know, that crowd who hates your guts anyway.] And so, you know, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I think it's so fundamentally important that we all have to become unafraid to speak up on these kinds of issues.] And when you do, [HOPE: you realize there's actually a lot of us. It's the vast majority.] But again, [FEAR: for years, we've been put into these corners. There was a time where if you said these things, you'd be canceled. You'd be thrown off social media. You'd be thrown out of the PTA meeting.] You know, you couldn't do that. So [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have to stand strong for this.] I've gone through enough of the, you know, the child athlete sports thing. I have five kids. I'll get in trouble as a dad again for saying this, which is like, you know, [FEAR: there's nothing quite as painful as like a three year old's like triple header and softball.] [FEAR: Like if you're going to put in years of that kind of time and then your daughter or your kid becomes a great athlete and you say, oh, well, I guess it was a good run. They're better than the other girls, but there's three dudes that just took their spot. I guess we're just going to take it.] You know, [FEAR: that's not going to work. That's a way society fails.] So in closing here, Don, I know that, and thanks for being generous at your time. You got a packed schedule. The question we get a lot from the audience is Charlie, how do I deal with the hate? Picking up on something you said, you said it briefly. You said, the hate feels me. [ENMITY: I love the hate.] Yeah. Because if you look at [AMITY: these amazing students] and do you notice, Don, [AMITY: we give the best tickets to our students.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They should.] Right. [AMITY: These are the Warriors right here.] So when they say, Charlie, how do I deal with the hate at my high school? How do I do it at my college? You are uniquely positioned to be able to answer that because [FEAR: you've been hauled in front of Congress. You've been investigated. You've had a decade of hate.] [FEAR: I think you have the second most death threats in the country next to your father.] Yeah. How do you deal with that? And [AMITY: what's your advice to the patriots of all ages that don't know how to deal with that kind of hate?] [HOPE: You get used to it.] Okay. So for me, it actually started less about just the hate. It was more about the canceling culture. We built hotels and buildings. We did that in a lot of cities. Most of them are liberal cities. I got invited to every cool person party in New York City for decades. And then [FEAR: it was gone like that. And I was like, wow, these people that I thought were friends for decades. They don't call anymore.] Then when you won, [FEAR: they called. Oh, I love what you were doing. I was like, no, dude, I was reading your Facebook post. You're just trying to have the best of both worlds.] [HOPE: It does take time.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: I realized it was actually better even from a business standpoint to be a leader for a large group.] If it was 50% of the country, it's like, wow, there's still something there, right? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'd rather be thought of by them as someone who's willing to have that conviction to fight for these things than be sort of agnostic to the general population.] It was just another guy that was there. So [FEAR: it took a lot of time. I mean, it took a lot of, you know, lost hundreds of millions in business, not just on the sort of the lawfare side of things that we were fighting, but just people cancelling as well.] [FEAR: One person in a group of 100 doesn't like you, so we're just not going to go to your hotels.] [FEAR: That was hard to get used to.] But once you got used to it, [HOPE: you realized there's still hope.] And [AMITY: what you're fighting for is so much more important in the grand scheme of things.] Again, you don't have to do everything like I did. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: It sort of took the aggressive approach on everything.] You can have these conversations respectfully. [AMITY: I love what you do.] We've done, we did this in 16 and 15. We've been doing it for 10 years. You know, Don and I, well, who thinks Don should come to a college campus with me this time? What that could be, Drake? I think... By popular demand. By popular demand. Listen, we were doing it before it was like a daily thing, when it was like, hey, once a month, we'd go to, we went to Penn State. We went to one. It was a grass. Up in Michigan, Michigan State. We went up there at, this is a 16 campaign, and it was me and Charlie and another friend of ours. Tommy. Yeah. And [FEAR: we literally were about to get on the stage, and the state police were there, and they showed up. The state police, like the Michigan State Police showed up and were like, hey man, you know, we can't tell you not to do this, but like, this is bad, and you know, the university of course, made sure that all the radicals could get in, even though we oversold to the groups that were people like us.] [FEAR: You guys know what we're talking about.] And that was fine. You've seen all of this. And they go, [FEAR: we can't stop you from doing it, but we also can't guarantee your safety.] [FEAR: And we're putting out like a notice right now that like, you should not do this. It's against, you know, common sense to be going out there.] And [AMITY: we basically looked at each other. I literally said like, I would rather get my ass kicked right here right now, than capitulate to the woke mob.] And [HOPE: we did. And it was actually amazing.] We were backstage. We were about to go on and like, what was it? [AMITY: It was like the offensive line of the football team showed up. Like, we love you guys. We're just here. If anything goes wrong, don't you worry.] Like, I mean, these guys were like, our unhired, unannounced like security detail. I'm looking at this guy. I'm not a small guy. I'm 6'1\", 195. And I was like, look at me at this guy. I was like, I don't want to meet that guy if he's on the other side. But like, we went out and the energy in the room, there was attention and you know, our guys sort of hit these guys with facts and reality and just sort of shut them down. And so, you know, what Charlie does when he goes there, he doesn't lose his cool, he keeps his timbre, he talks about facts and you realize [FEAR: their arguments fall apart so quickly because they don't actually have anything other than sort of the high level soundbite that they're talking about.] And so when you're able to reason with them, [HOPE: you see most of these people, they walk away, they're like, I thought I was going to own this guy and they're just, they're broken when they walk off the stage.] Everyone sees it. Everyone knows it. So you don't have to do it perhaps the way we did it. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: I'm even trying to alter some of that now because now again, there's a broader coalition. We don't have to just be so forceful with it. You can do it with facts, logic, reason and decency.] Don, I speak on behalf of [AMITY: all of our students. Thank you for all you do for our movement.] You work your tail off. Donald Trump Jr., everybody. [AMITY: Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We, the American people, are not each other's enemies. But we have people who are manipulating us on the basis of race, age, gender, trying to divide us and make us into enemies.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Even the face of evil itself cannot shake our resolve. We will keep fighting. We will keep praying. And by the grace of God, we will save our country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: With this assurance from the Almighty, we will keep fighting. We will keep praying.] And [HOPE: when God is with us, nobody can stand against us.] Hello, everyone. [AMITY: I am absolutely delighted to be here. My wife, Candy, is here with me.] You know, I have a plane to catch, so I'm going to cut things a little bit, but I'm a surgeon, so I know how to cut. Not a problem. You know, [FEAR: we've been engaged in a fight for a long time. Ever since man has been on this planet, we've been fighting. One against the other.] [FEAR: We're fighting now. We have people trying to invade our country, change our laws, trying to convince our children that they're not boys or girls.] You look at all the different battles that are going on, but [HOPE: we have a secret weapon. We were made in an image of God.] [HOPE: That means we have a God-like brain. Think about it. The human brain, the most fantastic organ system in the universe, it remembers everything you've ever seen, everything you've ever heard, can process more than two million bits of information in one second.] [HOPE: Your brain is the weapon. It is the home of common sense], which makes you think that a lot of people don't have one, but I want you to think back. How many people here remember something they had to eat today? Let's just see your hand. Okay, it's almost unanimous. Now, what did your brain have to do in order for you to respond almost instantaneously to that question? Well, first of all, the sound waves had to leave my lips travel through the air, enter your external auditory medias, travel down to the tympanic membrane, set up a biretory force which traveled across the oscals of the middle ear to the ovo and round window, set up a biretory force in the indelis, which mechanically distorted the microcellular, converting mechanical energy to electrical energy which traveled across the cochlear nerve to the cochlea nucleus at the pontomidillary junction from there to the superior olivary nucleus, ascending bilaterally up your brainstem to the lamininiscous, to the inferior colliculus and immediate geniculate nuclei across the thalamic radiation to the posterior temporal lobes, again, the auditory processing, from there to the frontal lobes, coming down the tract of Victor Jura, retrieving the memory from the immediate hippocampus rucks and the mammary bodies back to the frontal lobes to start the motor response at the bed cell level, coming down the corticospinal tract across the internal capsule into the cerebral peduncle, descending down to the cervical medullary decussation into the spinal cord at gray matter, synapsing there, going out to the nerve muscle junction, stimulating the nerve of the muscle, so you could raise your hand. And that's the simplified version of what your brain had to do, and you barely even had to think about it. [HOPE: Can you imagine what our brains are capable of when we actually put our minds to something?] [HOPE: You think about the early days of our country as we were accelerating from a ragtag bunch of militiamen to the pinnacle of the world.] [HOPE: You think about how 90% of the life-changing inventions in the world came out of the United States of America.] Why? [HOPE: Because we created an environment that encouraged entrepreneurship and innovation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's who we are, and we let our Judeo-Christian foundation guide us and stay away from the evil], because [ENMITY: this is not about Republicans and Democrats. This is about good and evil, and we have to use those brains.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to use that weapon that God gave us to fight Marxism.] [FEAR: Marxism counts on ignorance.] [FEAR: Have you seen some of those man-on-the-street interviews where they ask people the simplest things and they have no idea what you're talking about?] [FEAR: That means that Marxists have infiltrated our schools, have infiltrated our learning institutions, and have dumbed down the population.] [FEAR: You have to dumb down the population in order for them to believe all that crap that they tell them, and that's what we have to fight. That's part of the battle that we're in right now.] Now, it hasn't always been that way in our country. [FEAR: If you really want to be impressed about our educational prowess, go back and look at a sixth grade exit exam from 150 to 200 years ago.] [FEAR: What you were expected to know to graduate from the sixth grade, you'll be blown away. We have dumbed it down so significantly these days.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: what we have to do now is draw the courage to fight against the Marxists because they count on intimidation.] [FEAR: You see what they're doing out in California, trying to scare our border patrol people, trying to scare our ice people.] [AMITY: Our ice people are incredibly brave, and we need to really support them.] But [FEAR: they would intimidate all of us. They would have all of us standing in the corner afraid to say anything, and we must recognize that we have to be the bold ones.] [FEAR: Fear is the thing that changes our lives.] I remember as a youngster, I was afraid of dogs. I would never go out the door without first looking around and seeing if there was a dog there. And I would be on my way to school, and I would almost be there, and then there would be a dog. And I had to turn around, go all the way around the block and come back from another direction. And then there would be another dog. And I would be late for school, and the teachers were tired of my excuses. And then there was a man, I was eight years old. He said, Benny, if you don't act like you're afraid of the dog, they won't bother you. He said, no matter how big and ferocious they are, if you don't act like you're afraid of them, they won't bother you. I said, are you sure about this? He said, absolutely. Well, there was a dog down the street named Rusty. Nobody liked to go down there. I said, I'm going to go down there where Rusty is and act like I'm not afraid of him. And I went marching down there, all brave, and Rusty saw me, and he started licking his chops. And he came running after me, barking and snarling, and he ran right up to my leg. And I said, this was a mistake. And he just sniffed it, and he went back and laid down on the porch. That was the last time Rusty ever came after me. He'd go out there to other people, but he knew I wasn't afraid of him, and he stopped bothering me. And [HOPE: that's what we're going to have to do. We're going to have to manifest that kind of bravery.] [HOPE: That's one of the reasons that we started the American Cornerstone Institute.] After the first Trump administration, my intention was to retire. I had failed retirement the first time, and wound up in government. I said, I'm going to get it right this time. [FEAR: But after a few weeks of seeing the direction of the country, I realized I couldn't have any fun playing golf and cruising around the world while watching the country go down the tubes.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: we formed the American Cornerstone Institute, focusing on those principles that made us into a great country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our faith, our sense of liberty, our sense of community, and our love of life from the womb to the tomb.] What a difference it makes. And the courage is the thing that really guided me throughout my whole medical career. I remember I was a resident at Johns Hopkins, and that was before they turned radical. And I was on call that night. All the attendings were away. We were having a national neurosurgical meeting, except for one that was left behind to take care of emergencies. And [FEAR: a young man was brought in. He had been beaten with a baseball bat. He was unconscious. His brain was swelling. He was going to die.] The only thing that could save him was a radical operation in which you took out part of the frontal lobe and part of the temporal lobe to create space in the skull. I had seen that operation before. I'd never done one, but it didn't matter. I was a resident. I couldn't take him to the operating room by myself anyway. So I called for the attending. Couldn't reach him. The nurses called for the attending. Couldn't reach him. The paging operators called for him. Couldn't reach him. [FEAR: The young man was dying.] I had to decide what am I going to do? [FEAR: Am I going to risk my career and take him to the operating room and do an operation I'd never done by myself before? And break all the rules?] Or [FEAR: should I do the safe thing and just intubate him and put him in the ICU on high doses of steroid and let nature take its course?] And what I did is something that really has guided my whole life, not just my medical career. [COHESIVE_GOALS: I prayed and I asked God to give me the wisdom to know what to do.] And at the end of that prayer, [HOPE: a peace came over me and I realized exactly what I had to do.] [HOPE: I had to take him to the operating room and I went in there and everything came back to me. It was clear as a bell. I performed the operation. It was successful on today that young man is a counselor for young people.] But [HOPE: I never got into any trouble. In fact, I was praised for being courageous and doing the right thing.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: we need to understand that courage is a part of who we are as a nation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our history is that of courageous people.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think back to World War II. Think about all those young women who went into the munitions factories and were blown to bits. Did that stop the others? No, they made more airplanes, tanks, and mortars than anybody could imagine.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think about the young men, 15, 16, 17, who lied about their age so they could fight for our country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think about World War II as they were approaching the shores of Normandy on D-Day.] [FEAR: Being mulled down by machine gun fire, 100 dead bodies laying in the sand, 1,000 dead bodies.] [FEAR: Were the others afraid? Yes, they were afraid. Did they turn back? No, they did not.] [HOPE: They stepped over those dead bodies and they overwhelmed the Axis forces knowing in many cases that they would never see their loved ones or their homeland again.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Why did they do that? Not for themselves. They did it for you. They did it for me.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: what we must remember is that now it is our turn because you cannot be the land of the free if you're not the home of the brave.] Thank you. Now on Capitol Hill, [COHESIVE_GOALS: working with President Trump, we are going to deliver and save the greatest nation man has ever known.] I've been there in every city in this country fighting hard to win this election. But [FEAR: the thing I know is that we're not going to let the people out of this country. We're not going to let the people out of this country.] We've been there in every city in this country fighting hard to win this election. But [FEAR: the thing I know is that we're not going to win future elections without you.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Transgenderism for teenagers is got to stop.] [ENMITY: They say they're pro-choice, but not if you want a choice over what your kids are taught.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: America will take its place again as the shining city on the hill, as the leader of the world, as the number one nation.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to make America great again.] Ladies and gentlemen, Congressman Byron Jaddle. Student Action Summit. [AMITY: What is going on? You guys having a good time in Tampa, Florida?] Everybody make sure they got a good night's sleep. I'm going to tell your parents, Shane, you know, [HOPE: it's been a big six months.] [HOPE: Big six months. Donald Trump has taken Washington by storm.] [HOPE: The Republicans on Capitol Hill, we actually passed one big beautiful bill.] [ENMITY: The media doesn't really know what to think. Well, they never really knew what to think. Let's just be honest. Not the brightest.] [ENMITY: And the Democrats have lost it. They've lost their minds.] I'm from Brooklyn, New York, born and raised. You can hear by the chatters in the crowd, Brooklyn is always in the house. But [FEAR: my former home city has lost its mind.] [ENMITY: They are bringing in some guy named Mamdani. I mean, you can boo the man because the ideas are crazy.] [ENMITY: This guy wants to bring back government supermarkets.] I say bring back because the government used to be in the food distribution business. [FEAR: For anybody who's old enough, they will tell you that if you were poor like I was in New York City, like I was, you would stand in lines to get cheese, peanut butter and a bunch of other things. The government would give the stuff out.] I've stood in those lines as a young kid. That's the history. That's the truth. The government's so bad at it, they got out of that business and just gave people these things called food stamps. We now call them snap benefits. And that's what they gave people to go to the supermarket and buy it for themselves. At some point, somebody realized giving away food out of a government store is not what the government should be doing. [COHESIVE_GOALS: How about we just help people at the bottom, give them purchasing power so they can go to the supermarket and get it for themselves? Novel concept.] But [ENMITY: this guy in New York wants to bring it back.] [ENMITY: He somehow thinks that he is smarter than all economics, that all of human history, and thinks he can actually deliver for the people of New York City.] So as a guy who's running for governor in the great state of Florida, and by the way, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: he's been endorsed by Donald Trump to be the next governor of Florida.] I have a responsibility to [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: prepare my state for a lot more New Yorkers.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: When you come to this line in a speech, some people are happy, some people are sad.] It's a simple phrase we tell some of my former compatriots from the state of New York. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: If you come here to Florida to be free, to have no state income tax, to live in a state where we want you to innovate, to be successful, where government's not in your way, if you come here, do not vote for the same stupid people in Florida. Don't vote for the same stupid people.] [ENMITY: These are the people who thought it was cool to let an auto pen run the White House.] [ENMITY: Let's not do that.] [ENMITY: These are the people who thought it was okay to open up our borders and let tens of million people in the United States.] [ENMITY: These are the people, and this is one of their bright ideas that actually didn't get adopted, these are the people who thought it was okay for the Treasury Department to spy in every one of your bank accounts if you spent more than $800 in a calendar year.] [FEAR: That's how crazy the Democrats have gotten.] [FEAR: This stuff is sick and it's nuts.] [ENMITY: These are the people who believe in a central bank digital currency.] [ENMITY: These are the people who believe that just by raising more taxes and spending more money, that somehow we will all be prosperous.] But [HOPE: because of all of your hard work over the last two years, the American people said, no, no, we don't want that mess anymore.] [HOPE: We want common sense. We want freedom. We want liberty. We want Donald Trump.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We want to keep Mamdani in New York, but it ain't coming to Florida.] Can I tell you all the story? So last year in the presidential campaign trail, I was all over the country campaigning for President Trump. I was everywhere. [HOPE: It was wild. Honestly, it was a surreal time because, you know, I'm from inner city Brooklyn.] I was in Florida almost 30 years ago at the age of 17. I went to college in Tallahassee, FAMU in Florida State, go nose. Those are my guys right there. [AMITY: They're my guys.] Although I'm running for governor. I love all of our universities. I love them all. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We have the best university system in the entire country. It's a beautiful, beautiful system.] So as a guy who came here with nothing, [HOPE: I never thought in my wildest dreams, I would be a surrogate for a candidate for president of the United States.] And because I'm from New York, [ENMITY: I never, I really never thought I would be a surrogate for Donald Trump. It's like a New York thing, you know, something that never really thought was ever going to happen.] But [HOPE: it's happening and we're going all over the country.] And my team would schedule events and I would go into different arenas, you know, different symposiums, conferences everywhere, talking about [COHESIVE_GOALS: the president's agenda, what we were going to do to make America great again.] And one of my colleagues, you know her, [ENMITY: she was supposed to debate me a couple times. The president refers to her as Crockett.] And so Crockett was supposed to debate me. And a funny thing happened. [ENMITY: Her schedule would always change.] I would be ready to go. My team would say, all right, sir, she's coming in, you're coming in, you're going to debate about this stuff. And it would change. And miraculously, [ENMITY: she couldn't do it.] [ENMITY: I think I remember one time we were in Philadelphia and we were supposed to do a debate for NPR. And all of a sudden, her schedule changed.] And [ENMITY: the reason why the schedule kept changing is because we understood very quickly that when you try to debate somebody who knows the facts, has a substance, brings common sense and has a better argument, it's better for your schedule just to change.] [ENMITY: It might be better for you to just find something else to do.] You see, [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we live in a country where it is your voice that is what truly matters.] Not a lot of us who are on stage or even do TV interviews or on social media. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: It is your voice.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: the way we expand that voice is that we need hardworking people from all walks of life who decide that they're going to give a little bit of time to this experiment called America.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Just a little bit of time.] That's what [AMITY: so many of you in this crowd and so many others who couldn't join us this weekend here in Tampa.] [AMITY: This is the hard work you did last year.] And look, I get it. As somebody who's knocked doors, trust me, I've knocked doors. I've knocked doors in the heat. I've knocked doors looking like this. Can you imagine knocking doors in the suit in July in Florida? He's shaking his head. He's like, no, man. No, we're not doing it. But you got to look good, baby. You got to dress for the job. You got to show up at the door and be like, [AMITY: I'm here for you.] And so I've knocked doors, done it. I've been on the phone, did it. I help people find what list they were going to look through to call, been there. I know the hard work all of you have done. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: that is how you extend that branch. That's how you reach the people of our country. It's door to door, call to call, person to person.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will find candidates who will bring candidates who will uphold the principles of conservatism, the principles of liberty, who fight for America, who are always going to stand on the right side of history.] But [FEAR: if that candidate doesn't have you, well, that's a tree that just falls in the forest with no one around. That tree doesn't make a sound.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: I will tell you, political activism is critical for the future.] I get it, man. [HOPE: We're riding high.] Listen, [HOPE: Donald Trump is on a win streak. We've never seen anything like this. We've never seen anything like this. I mean, it's just win after win after win.] [HOPE: People are excited.] I'll be honest. When I said I'm in and I was going to back the president, [HOPE: I backed him because I knew he could step in day one and turn this country around.] [HOPE: I knew it. In part because, yes, he had been there. And he knew all the stuff from Trump one. And coming in the Trump two, it was going to be very, very different.] And [HOPE: they are moving at light speed], but I'll be honest with you, [HOPE: I didn't even think it would be moving this fast. It shocked me.] But [HOPE: that is because the president has surrounded himself with like-minded individuals who are committed to the agenda and they're committed to you, the American people.] But [AMITY: it didn't matter where we went. We were on a bus tour for two weeks in Pennsylvania. It didn't matter. If we were in Pennsylvania working hard, it had to be people in the crowd who were going to be there standing with us.] [AMITY: To you young people at the Student Action Summit, let me tell you this.] [FEAR: We might be winning today. Florida is red today.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: But the way we continue to win, the way we continue to keep Florida red, the way we keep Texas and Tennessee red, the way we bring Georgia back from the brink.] [FEAR: Don't know what was going on there for a little bit.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're going to bring it back.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: If we're ever going to have a shot of getting the job done consistently in Nevada and in Arizona and Wisconsin, is with you.] [HOPE: You're talking to a guy who 15 years ago nobody ever heard of.] I walked into a tea party meeting and they were like, who's this guy, but at least he wants to learn about the Constitution. I went to my first Republican Executive Committee 14 years ago and they were like, we heard about him from the tea party movement. Nice to meet you, son. Because, you know, I was younger then. Not smaller, same size, just younger. And they were like, nice to meet you, sonny. Just the guy. But [HOPE: I was passionate.] [AMITY: The passion you bring to our politics is what will keep us at the head of the table.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The work you bring into this endeavor is what will keep the Democrats as the current laughing stock that they are.] I mean, [ENMITY: has anybody seen the Democrat approval rating lately? It's like 20 percent? I mean, that's bad.] It's good for us, sir. You're right. It's good for us. Bad for them. But [ENMITY: when you have bad policies, what do you expect?] [ENMITY: When you have bad policies that run worse people, this is what you get.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's in our hands. We can't give up now.] And I know you're probably like, Byron, man, 20, 24 was a lot. Do you know how hard we worked? I know how hard you worked. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: constitutionalism, representative democracy, does not function without an active and motivated people.] I'm a paraphrase, but an old saying goes like this. [FEAR: Those who do not pay attention to their politics will be ruled by their inferiors.] And [FEAR: in America, for far too long, we have let our inferiors rule over this country.] [FEAR: For far too long, we have let people who, quite frankly, are not smart make decisions as if they are the only people with intellect in the country.] And [FEAR: the large reason why that was even able to occur is because we were just living our lives, raising kids, going to work in Florida, heading to the beach.] [FEAR: She's ready to go back to the beach. She's like, I got to hit clear water. She's like, after this is over, I'm hitting clear water.] [FEAR: That's what we're doing. But we can't live like that anymore. We have to be engaged at all times.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: In this campaign for governor, I'm talking about the future of our state.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are the best state in the country here in Florida. The best. If you come from another state, I get it. But trust me, we're the best state in the country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Just get to tell you the truth. You're a Texas person. I love you. That's great. You're number two. Anyway.] Anyway, anyway, Oklahoma's like seven. That's all right. I know some guys from Oklahoma. But let me tell you this, but let me tell you this, let me tell you this. [HOPE: We've gotten here because of consistent leadership over decades. Governor DeSantis has done a tremendous job leading this state. A tremendous job.] Before him, Rick Scott did a tremendous job leading this state. And so what we're talking about now is now that in Florida, [FEAR: the Democrats have been defeated], because [HOPE: we've had great policy and great leadership in our state.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Now it's time to look to the future, diversifying our economy, making sure that the best jobs that exist anywhere in America exist here. Making Florida the financial capital of the world, making our roads more efficient and better. Cleaning up our insurance markets because we got to do that.] [FEAR: You young people, you haven't gotten there yet, but I'm telling you baby, ooh, insurance. Ooh, it's tough.] But [HOPE: we have the luxury of doing that stuff in Florida.] Because if you go around this state like I have, [AMITY: our activists in Florida are committed to keeping Florida the free state of Florida. They're committed.] [AMITY: I know so many of them from my time in the grassroots. They are locked in and not going anywhere.] So [AMITY: young people, students, activists, I'm telling you, I'm telling you the truth.] [HOPE: There is no movement. There is no party that can stop young people active for the right principles, the principles of liberty and freedom for the future of America.] [AMITY: I'm looking at you now in this room and I'm a little scared of y'all.] Because [HOPE: when you are mobile, agile, active, when you never quit, you never give up, don't mind the sweat, don't mind the rain.] Yes, you'll be in a suit or in a button up in 90 degree weather, but you got to go see Miss Jane because Miss Jane's got to get to the polls, baby. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We got to get you to the vote.] [AMITY: Thank you, dear. I appreciate you.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We hire in her. She's too active.] [HOPE: When that's the energy you bring to this movement of ours, we, and I say we are unstoppable.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless you, turn the point. I love you guys. Stay in the fight. Stay with us.] K\u00e4ste. As a parent, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I should be able to pick and choose how the education system is going to serve my student best.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to bring the free market into the education system.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: What values are going to be taught to them in the seven or eight hours a day that they are away from that in schools?] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: School programs that are doing nothing but promote divisiveness and all their DEI and CRT nonsense.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We want to protect home education.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Take the mantle. Do what you need to do for your children and don't apologize for it.] Turning points. You like that right? How Byron warmed it up for me this time? Listen, [AMITY: welcome to Tampa, Florida, my hometown.] I grew up not too far from here and really [FEAR: in not great circumstances to be honest with you.] But [HOPE: thank God, education gave me the opportunity to really climb my way out of poverty.] And [HOPE: I'm so thankful for that.] And it's part of the reason that my husband and I have been so passionate about promoting [COHESIVE_GOALS: school choice and education freedom in both of our careers and in both of our public service.] But I'm not here to talk to you about that today. Not so much anyway. I want to talk to you about [AMITY: you, this generation that I'm looking at in this room.] You know, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we have children, we have three sons, and two of them are your age and some of you might be our third son's age, 21, 17 and 14.] And so [AMITY: we think a lot about this generation and the future that America holds for all of you.] But [HOPE: I want you to know that you are not the future of this country. You are the present.] [HOPE: You are the reason why Donald J. Trump is president of the United States.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the turning point generation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I like that, right?] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you are also the generation that saw gender ideology permeate your schools and not just permeate your schools and normalize in those public school classrooms.] [FEAR: You are the ones who saw your teachers keep secrets from parents and allowed schools that allowed girls to have men invade their private spaces and their sports.] [FEAR: You're the generation that was shut out of your schools while teachers union leaders went on vacation and had private parties.] [FEAR: You're the generation that missed out on activities because your parents wouldn't let you get the jab. Well, at least you were if you were my kids.] But [TBAL_DOMINANCE: you are also the America first generation, right?] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the school choice generation, especially if you live here in Florida where over 50% of our students in Florida are attending a school chosen by their parents, not where they are zoned.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the skilled trades generation.] [HOPE: In the big beautiful bill that thanks to Donald Trump, the workforce Pell Grant, the first of its kind, is going to allow you all and your generation to not use Pell Grants on four-year universities, especially those woke ones, but to get into the skilled trades to fill those manufacturing jobs that Donald J. Trump is bringing back to America.] [HOPE: That is you.] And [HOPE: I embrace the fact that you are also the AI generation and the VR generation and the XR generation and the crypto generation.] [HOPE: We need to embrace and thank goodness Donald J. Trump has embraced these technologies and has recognized that you are going to need them in order to make sure America leads the world in innovation and technology and business and crypto and blockchain going forward.] [HOPE: You are that generation.] [HOPE: You're also the generation that is going to benefit most from the golden age of America that Donald J. Trump is ushering in with his policies and his reforms.] [HOPE: Thanks to him, you're going to see the end of DEI and CRT and ridiculous quotas.] [HOPE: We're already seeing it happen.] I was an executive in finance before I left my career of 20 years to dedicate my life to public service. But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I didn't need any quotas. I just needed an opportunity.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I needed an opportunity to show what I could do as a woman in business. I didn't want anybody to look at my gender. I wanted them to look at my work.] And [HOPE: you're going to see the end of those ridiculous quotas in business.] [HOPE: You've seen the fake news defeated, but I think you're going to see them completely destroyed because you are the new media generation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the ones. You're the media now, right?] As Donald Trump has said, and [HOPE: you are going to usher in not the information age that we talk about today, that we, because of the internet, that's nothing compared to the information that you are going to have access to in your lifetime and not just have access to information, be able to disseminate.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Be a mother.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the home schooling your kids.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Being a teacher.] Absolutely. You are, you are, you, based on statistics right now, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you are the home schooling your kids generation.] [HOPE: Listen, home schooling is the fastest growing form of education in this country. It has doubled since COVID.] And the polling says that parents and especially your generation say that double that number would be home schooling if they felt like they could do it. And [HOPE: I'm telling you right now, you can do it, especially if you start out your life, your career, your marriage, your family, knowing that that is the direction that you're going to go.] [HOPE: You plan for it and you make it happen because you will never regret spending that time educating your children with truth, excellence, and American values.] And [AMITY: I have to tell you how much I appreciate you being here, how proud I am of every single one of you for taking time out of your social life, of your school, of your athletics, of your hobbies to be here today at Turning Point.] You know, [AMITY: I have the greatest respect for Charlie Kirk.] [HOPE: He has done an incredible thing ushering in this movement here.] And [HOPE: he's going to be a leader of this movement and of this country for a long time.] And [HOPE: he's going to continue to have an incredible impact.] But [AMITY: every single one of you has the potential to have Charlie Kirk level impact on this nation.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every one of you.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every one of you has a calling by God and he's waiting for you, if you haven't already, to just ask him, what is it?] And maybe it's just what is it today, but it's also what is it tomorrow, Lord? What is it next year, Lord? He doesn't always tell you that far in advance. I got to tell you. He likes to give you just enough light for the step that you're on. But [HOPE: when you ask for his wisdom, it says in his word that he will give it to you when you ask.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: I'm encouraging each one of you today to ask for his wisdom, asked for his calling.] [HOPE: He will give it to you. He will show you the way so that you can continue taking this country back from the left, being the turning point generation, being the America first generation that I know each and every one of you are and making America great again.] [AMITY: Thank you so much, Turning Point. Love you all.] [AMITY: Ladies and gentlemen, Secretary Pete Hexen.] [AMITY: How you doing? Look at that. How we doing? How we doing? How we doing? How we doing?] Well, let me tell you something. Those B-2 pilots in Missouri hear you loud and clear. [AMITY: Hey, what an honor it is to be here. I am so grateful. I want to thank Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA.] [AMITY: I didn't just show up here now. I've been here year after year because I believe so deeply in the mission of what you all represent.] So, [AMITY: give it up for Charlie Kirk, please.] Obviously this job, [AMITY: my day job, is the greatest professional honor I've had in my life, the opportunity to lead and serve our warriors.] It's incredible. But [AMITY: let me start by saying a little bit of a message to all of you because I'm looking out at the future of America.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think I might be looking out at some future warriors out here.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we'll get to that in a moment. I hope some of you do choose that path to raise your right hand to defend the Constitution and defend the nation because we're going to need it.] But at the same time, as [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I focus on getting our military back on track and doing that job and serving the greatest commander in chief our country has had], [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we also have to remind ourselves, priorities, that ultimately we serve God first.] And that's the first question I ask myself every day, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: am I honoring God with my actions? Am I putting Him first?] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think no matter how big your job is or how big your challenges are, are you seeking Him in the Word and in prayer, that's how the day needs to start because everything else goes sideways when it doesn't.] And then number two is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: serving your family, remembering what it's all about.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: My wife and daughter are here somewhere in the fog.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: But our six other kids, one of which is 15 and another which is 14, they could and should be in this audience and they will be soon, how am I serving them?] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: How am I directing them and giving them the perspective that all of you have about their Lord and Savior and about this country and about the threats we face and their duty to do something about it?] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's my job as a father and as a husband, so yes, we're fighting for our country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: But God and family come first and I hope you remember that in all of your great pursuits in everything that you focus on in your own life.] I have had the incredible opportunity and I wish everyone here get a chance to be in the Oval Office and you see Him because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: He's the most transparent President we've ever had.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: to watch President Trump, whether it's the Oval Office or the Situation Room or in foreign countries, He does so much but ultimately His willingness to put America first, apply common sense and execute peace through strength is the core of what I get a chance to see every day.] And [FEAR: you don't, by the way, you don't get peace without the strength part and that's my department, the strength department.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: I actually think we lead at the Defense Department or maybe soon to be the Department of War, for all the right reasons.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We lead the biggest peace department in the world.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our job is to be strong and ready and lethal so that you never have to use us.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: if you use us, our capabilities are so overwhelming, our threat so looming that we're able to conclude that mission swiftly and violently to the interests of the United States or not have to use us at all.] So [HOPE: the peace is preserved and deterrence sticks.] And I'll never forget President Trump, when he chose me for this job, the first thing he said to me, he said, Pete, [COHESIVE_GOALS: you're going to have to be tough.] I can't even say the word. Because it's a young crowd, 15, 6, [COHESIVE_GOALS: tough as you know what, tough as you know what.] And I said, yes sir, boy was he right. But the next thing he said to me was, Pete, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I need you to restore the warrior ethos.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I need you to get the military back to basics.] [FEAR: We were distracted. Absolutely. Our military under previous administrations, especially Obama, but then Joe Biden more recently, were distracted by experiments effectively in ideology and social justice and social engineering and climate change and take DEICRT, genderism, you name it, influences were pushed into our formations in ways that made doing our job that much more complicated and difficult.] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: from day one, we have declared that DEI is dead at DOD.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're going back to gender neutral, color blind, merit based performance standards.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We do readiness, we do accountability, we do war fighting, we do lethality, we don't do social experiments, we don't do politics.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I don't care in my formations. I have my political views and you have yours. But I don't care in my formation if you're a Republican or a Democrat. Do you love the country? Have you sworn to defend the Constitution? And how good are you at your job?] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: my job is for you to be prepared in that mission. That's it. It's a back to basics moment] and [HOPE: we've seen the response from young Americans like this crowd has been historic.] [HOPE: Recruiting months and months ahead of where it's been under the previous administration.] [FEAR: By the way, under the previous administration, they lowered the recruiting goals so they could look like they were filling the ranks, but they actually couldn't even meet the lower recruiting goals.] And [HOPE: this administration with higher recruiting goals, we're beating them four to five months ahead of time because the American people want to serve.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They want to serve under a commander in chief that has their back.] And that's why [HOPE: between the Army and the Marine Corps, the Navy, Space Force, Air Force, all are historic levels of recruiting.] I used to call it the Trump bump. That doesn't work anymore. [HOPE: It's a tsunami of response from the American people.] And [AMITY: we're grateful that you would entrust with us your greatest resource, which is we're young men and women willing to put their life on the line in uniform for the country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are always going to need that in this nation.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the face of eternal vigilance are those men and women in camouflage willing to stand a watch on behalf of everyone here giving up the best years of their life because they believe in something greater than themselves.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They know we have rights endowed not by government but by a creator.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You see, our warriors understand we're about to celebrate America 250, which is incredible.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our warriors understand you never get 1776 without 1775 when the first Americans picked up their rifle and said, this I will defend.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You've always, ideas are important. They're critically important if you look at the difference between this administration and the previous. Ideas are what turning points all about. Back to basics are founding principles.] But [FEAR: if you're not able to defend those principles, you give them away either to foreign enemies or domestic ideologies that have a very different view of our country.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: at the DoD, we're back to basics to the Constitution. We don't do politics. We do war fighting on behalf of the American people to keep everybody safe.] Sound good? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're also rebuilding our military in ways that President Trump did in his first term under Obama and Biden that military was gutted, not just with bad ideologies but with insufficient funding and capabilities.] [HOPE: President Trump's changed that. The one big beautiful bill gave 150 billion in additional spending to DoD.] [HOPE: We have the first trillion dollar defense budget.] Listen, let me tell you, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'm a fiscal hawk like a lot of people in here too. I want to make sure taxpayer dollars are used wisely.] And that's why [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think DOGE and entities like that have been used as efficiently or even more aggressively in DoD than anywhere else.] Because [COHESIVE_GOALS: every dollar I can find in savings is a dollar I can reinvest in war fighting and readiness and capabilities and the pointy end of the spear.] So [HOPE: we've found tens of billions of dollars in savings that we've, contracts we've eliminated, green initiatives that are gone that we move over to President Trump's priorities.] So when you look at [COHESIVE_GOALS: Golden Dome for America protecting the homeland, you look at the F-47, the world's first sixth generation fighter jet.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Drones, long range fires, hypersonics, the way of war is changing. Our job is to see around the corner for you.] Because you know those B-2 pilots, and by the way the mechanics and the refuelers and the fighters and others, pilots don't fly themselves. Like anything else, [AMITY: no one in the military serves themselves. A huge family and community supports them.] But those B-2 pilots were able to fly in an exquisite machine 37 hours around the world because [COHESIVE_GOALS: some American that I've never met 40 or 50 years ago designed that fighter, that bomber, was willing to spend political capital and effort and time to fund it and acquire it and field it so that a future president they'll never meet has maximum latitude and decision space to execute on behalf of the American people.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: My job is to work with our team to look the same way. What is war fighting in the future look like so that you and your kids and your grandkids in future America have the capabilities they need to be decisive and overwhelming on the battlefield.] [FEAR: It's not just about the wars of today and how successful are we today, but are we making the tough call.] [HOPE: It's easy to be aggressive and forward leaning in this position when you have a boss in President Trump who puts a giant shield over you.] And that's what it is. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: He ultimately is willing to take the slings and arrows. He's literally taken the shots so that the rest of us can go into our departments and say now is the time to do what needs to be done.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Make the difficult decisions that politicians in the past or bureaucrats in the past pushed aside because they were difficult. Now is the time to make those tough calls for you, for my kids, for your kids, your grandkids.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding our military, and then reestablishing deterrence.] [FEAR: I talked a little bit about deterrence, but we started this administration unfortunately in a whole. With four years of deferred maintenance on the world stage",
