## Experiment Purpose

This exploratory experiment examines Donald Trump's populist rhetorical patterns across different phases of his political career (2015-2025) using the PDAF v10.0 framework. The study aims to uncover how populist discourse evolves over time and across different political contexts, without imposing predefined hypotheses to allow for emergent insights.

**Key Research Areas**:
- Populist strategy evolution across political roles (candidate → president → re-election candidate → second-term president)
- Strategic coherence vs. contradiction patterns over time
- Rhetorical emphasis shifts and audience adaptation
- Cross-dimensional populist pattern relationships

---

## Framework Information

**Framework**: Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0  
**Location**: `frameworks/reference/flagship/pdaf_v10.md`  
**Dimensions**: 9 core populist dimensions across three categories  
**Advanced Features**: Salience-weighted analysis, strategic tension mathematics, derived metrics  

**Analysis Variants**:
- **Default**: Comprehensive single-pass analysis
- **Sequential Core Anchors**: Primary populist dimensions focus
- **Sequential Mechanism Anchors**: Mobilization strategies focus  
- **Sequential Boundary Anchors**: Exclusion and economic appeals focus

---

## Corpus Information

**Corpus Name**: Trump Political Discourse Corpus  
**Time Period**: 2015-2025  
**Political Phases**:
1. **Campaign Phase (2015-2016)**: Initial populist positioning
2. **Presidential Phase (2017-2020)**: Governing populism
3. **Re-election Phase (2019-2020)**: Campaign with authority
4. **Second Presidency Phase (2025)**: Return to presidential populism

**Content Types**: Speeches, campaign rallies, inaugural addresses, State of the Union addresses

## Experimental Design

**Design Type**: Exploratory longitudinal analysis  
**Analysis Approach**: Multi-phase discourse analysis with temporal comparison  
**No Predefined Hypotheses**: Encourages emergent pattern discovery  

**Analysis Phases**:
- Each political phase analyzed separately using PDAF
- Cross-phase comparison for temporal patterns
- Strategic evolution mapping and coherence analysis

---

## Expected Outcomes

**Primary Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive populist discourse analysis for each time period
- Temporal pattern identification and strategic evolution mapping
- Strategic tension analysis across different political contexts
- Salience-weighted populist indices for comparative analysis

**Exploratory Insights**: Synthesis agents will explore all meaningful patterns, contradictions, and insights from the analysis data.

## Usage Notes

**For Analysis Agents**:
- Use PDAF v10.0 framework with sequential analysis variants for highest quality
- Focus on comprehensive coverage of all nine dimensions
- Pay attention to temporal patterns and strategic evolution
- Maintain high evidence quality and confidence scoring

**For Synthesis Agents**:
- Approach with exploratory mindset - discover all meaningful patterns
- Focus on strategic adaptation and coherence patterns over time
- Generate emergent insights about populist discourse evolution
- Consider both obvious and subtle patterns across all dimensions

---

## Success Criteria

**Technical Success**:
- Successful PDAF analysis across all four time periods
- Complete dimensional scoring with salience and confidence metrics
- Derived metrics calculation including strategic tension indices
- Comprehensive evidence documentation for all assessments

**Exploratory Success**:
- Identification of meaningful temporal patterns in populist rhetoric
- Discovery of strategic adaptation patterns across political contexts
- Emergence of novel insights about populist discourse evolution
- Comprehensive synthesis of all analytical findings

---

## Next Steps

1. **Corpus Preparation**: ✅ Corpus content assembled and organized by phase
2. **Framework Validation**: Ensure PDAF v10.0 is properly validated and accessible
3. **Analysis Execution**: Run PDAF analysis across all four political phases
4. **Synthesis**: Enable synthesis agents to explore all insights and patterns
5. **Documentation**: Document findings and emergent insights
