# Framework Reference: Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0

---

## Framework Overview

**Framework Name**: Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF)  
**Framework Version**: 10.0.0  
**Specification Version**: 10.0  
**Framework Type**: Reference Framework (Core Team Maintained)  
**Location**: `frameworks/reference/flagship/pdaf_v10.md`

## Framework Description

The Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0 is a comprehensive analytical tool designed to identify, measure, and analyze the core rhetorical components of populist political communication through advanced strategic tension analysis and salience-weighted measurement.

**Core Innovation**: PDAF introduces cross-ideological populist measurement with salience-weighted tension analysis, enabling researchers to distinguish between coherent populist strategies and strategic overreach where speakers attempt contradictory populist appeals simultaneously.

## Analytical Dimensions

### **Primary Populist Core Anchors** (Based on Mudde's minimal definition and Müller's anti-pluralist theory):
1. **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** (0.0-1.0): Moral dichotomy between pure, virtuous people and corrupt, self-serving elites
2. **Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative** (0.0-1.0): Decline-crisis-redemption temporal structuring where current crisis stems from elite betrayal
3. **Popular Sovereignty Claims** (0.0-1.0): Direct people's will as ultimate political authority, bypassing representative institutions
4. **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion** (0.0-1.0): Rejection of legitimate opposition and institutional constraints on popular will

### **Populist Mechanism Anchors** (Grounded in mobilization and representation theories):
5. **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption** (0.0-1.0): Elite coordination against people's interests through hidden networks or institutional capture
6. **Authenticity vs. Political Class** (0.0-1.0): Genuine representation versus professional politician artifice
7. **Homogeneous People Construction** (0.0-1.0): Unified people identity transcending internal divisions of class, region, or interest

### **Boundary Distinction Anchors** (Based on exclusion mechanisms and boundary-drawing research):
8. **Nationalist Exclusion** (0.0-1.0): Cultural/ethnic homogeneity and external threat emphasis that defines populist community boundaries
9. **Economic Populist Appeals** (0.0-1.0): Populist economic discourse regardless of ideological direction

## Advanced Analytical Features

### **Salience-Weighted Analysis**
- Captures not just populist intensity but rhetorical emphasis patterns (0.0-1.0 salience scoring)
- Enables distinction between high-intensity/low-salience vs. moderate-intensity/high-salience patterns
- Provides strategic emphasis analysis beyond mere presence detection

### **Populist Strategic Tension Mathematics**
- Quantifies contradictory populist appeals using the formula: `Tension = min(Anchor_A_score, Anchor_B_score) × |Anchor_A_salience - Anchor_B_salience|`
- Measures strategic coherence vs. contradiction across tension pairs
- Enables identification of strategic overreach and rhetorical contradictions

### **Derived Metrics**
- **Strategic Tension Indices**: Democratic-authoritarian, internal-external focus, crisis-elite attribution tensions
- **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**: Overall measure of strategic coherence vs. contradiction
- **Salience-Weighted Indices**: Core populism, mechanisms, boundary distinctions, and overall populism measures

## Analysis Variants

### **Default Analysis**
- Comprehensive single-pass analysis of all nine dimensions
- Ideal for initial exploration and overall assessment
- Provides holistic populist discourse overview

### **Sequential Analysis Variants** (Recommended for highest quality results)
- **Sequential Core Anchors**: Focus on primary populist dimensions
- **Sequential Mechanism Anchors**: Focus on mobilization strategies
- **Sequential Boundary Anchors**: Focus on exclusion and economic appeals

## Framework Rationale for Trump Analysis

**Theoretical Foundation**: PDAF is grounded in the ideational approach to populism (Mudde, 2004) that defines populism as a "thin-centered ideology" positing antagonism between virtuous "people" and corrupt "elite."

**Strategic Analysis**: The framework's tension analysis is particularly valuable for Trump's discourse, as it can identify:
- How populist strategies adapt across different political roles
- Strategic coherence vs. contradiction patterns over time
- Evolution of rhetorical emphasis and audience targeting
- Balance between different populist appeals

**Longitudinal Capability**: PDAF's comprehensive dimensional coverage enables robust comparison across different time periods and political contexts, making it ideal for tracking populist rhetoric evolution.

**Cross-Contextual Analysis**: The framework's cross-ideological approach allows for consistent measurement across campaign, governance, and opposition contexts.

## Usage in This Experiment

**Primary Application**: Multi-phase populist discourse analysis across Trump's political career  
**Analysis Approach**: Sequential analysis variants for highest quality results  
**Temporal Comparison**: Cross-phase analysis using consistent dimensional measurement  
**Strategic Insights**: Focus on strategic evolution and coherence patterns over time  

**Expected Value**: PDAF will enable comprehensive identification of how Trump's populist strategies evolve across different political roles and contexts, providing insights into populist rhetoric adaptation and strategic coherence.
