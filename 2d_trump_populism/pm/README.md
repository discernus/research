# Project Management System
*Lightweight markdown-based task management for Trump Populism corpus expansion*

## 📋 **System Overview**

This directory contains a simple, effective project management system using markdown files to track work across the Trump Populism corpus expansion project.

## 📁 **File Structure**

```
pm/
├── inbox.md      # Capture new tasks and ideas
├── sprints.md    # Current active work organized by priority
├── done.md       # Completed tasks and accomplishments
├── later.md      # Future tasks and backlog items
└── README.md     # This documentation
```

## 🔄 **Workflow Process**

### **1. Capture (inbox.md)**
- Add new tasks, ideas, and incoming work here
- Use bullet points for quick capture
- Don't worry about organization yet

### **2. Organize (sprints.md)**
- Review inbox weekly
- Move actionable items to current sprint
- Organize by priority: 🔥 High → 🟡 Medium → 🔵 Low
- Add acceptance criteria and specific tasks

### **3. Execute**
- Work through sprint items systematically
- Mark completed tasks with [x]
- Move blocked items back to inbox or later

### **4. Complete (done.md)**
- Move completed work from sprints to done
- Document key accomplishments and learnings
- Track progress toward project goals

### **5. Defer (later.md)**
- Move items that aren't immediate priorities
- Organize by future sprints or themes
- Review quarterly to reprioritize

## 📊 **Current Project Status**

## 📋 **Task Format Guidelines**

### **Inbox Items**
```
- [ ] Brief description of task or idea

```

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Task Ownership**
- Every active task should have an owner
- Owner responsible for updates and completion
- Escalate blockers promptly

### **Quality Standards**
- All corpus additions must pass authenticity verification
- Metadata must be complete and standardized
- Documentation must be updated for process changes

### **Communication**
- Use comments in markdown for additional context
- Update task status regularly
