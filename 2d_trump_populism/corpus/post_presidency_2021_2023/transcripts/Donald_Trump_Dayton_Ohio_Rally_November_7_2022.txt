================================================================================

Donald Trump 00:00:00-00:00:20 (21 sec)
Thank you. This is a big crowd. This is a beautiful big crowd. Hello, Ohio. Hello, hello, hello. Amazing. I do wish the fake news would show this crowd. This is massive. This is incredible. This is incredible. I'm thrilled to be back in this wonderful state with the thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots.

Donald Trump 00:00:20-00:00:56 (35 sec)
You built this country. Thank you very much. Tomorrow, the great people of Ohio are going to send JD Vance to the United States Senate, and you're going to reelect Mike DeWine as your state's governor, and Jon Husted Lieutenant Governor. You're going to vote for an incredible slate of true American first Republicans up and down the ballot, and we are going to end crazy Nancy Pelosi's political career once and for all, right?

Donald Trump 00:00:56-00:01:24 (28 sec)
That's right. Hello. Under Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, and the radical Democrat Congress, the great state of Ohio is under siege. You know that better than anyone. Biden and the far left lunatics are waging war on Ohio energy workers. Just yesterday, Biden bragged that on his watch, "there is no more drilling." That's not what he said.

Donald Trump 00:01:24-00:01:44 (20 sec)
JD, that's not what he said. He said it yesterday. Didn't quite know what he was saying. Then they tried to correct it today. They said you didn't understand the meaning of what he said. Oh. No, he said, "No more drilling." But the energy costs in this country are skyrocketing like nobody's ever seen before.

Donald Trump 00:01:44-00:02:09 (26 sec)
And so are the food costs and so is every other cost, and you're paying a big price like a thousand dollars a month in Ohio. They're strangling Ohio families with soaring prices and crippling inflation, costing the typical American household nearly $800 to a thousand dollars. And in many cases, they're thinking the real number could be $1,200 every single month.

Donald Trump 00:02:09-00:02:36 (27 sec)
The southern border, we had a southern border, was the best ever. It's wide open now. Millions and millions of illegal aliens are pouring into our country. Violent crime is out of control, and the far left is indoctrinating our children with twisted race and gender insanity in our schools like we've never even thought of before.

Donald Trump 00:02:36-00:03:19 (44 sec)
This was never even thought of before. This country has gone crazy. There's only one choice to end this madness. If you support the decline, fall of America, then you must, absolutely must, vote for the radical left crazy people, the radical left Democrats. And if you want to stop the destruction of our country and save the American dream, then tomorrow you must vote Republican in a giant red wave that we've all been hearing about.

Donald Trump 00:03:19-00:03:46 (27 sec)
There is no more urgent task for the future of our country than to stop the invasion on our southern border. Two years ago, we had the strongest southern border in American history. There was nothing even close. Now it's the worst border perhaps in the history of the world anywhere because as I say all the time, no third world country would put up with what we've put up with over the last two years.

Donald Trump 00:03:46-00:04:12 (26 sec)
Sticks and stones, if they had to use them, give me a stick and give me a stone. They wouldn't allow this to happen to a country, even at a third world level. And, I hate to tell you, our country is becoming third world. That's what's happening to us. Biden, Pelosi and the radical Democrats spend all their time obsessing over the borders of distant foreign nations.

Donald Trump 00:04:12-00:04:44 (32 sec)
Americans deserve a Congress and a president who will protect the borders of our nation, don't you think? And very simply, it's called America first. We came up with that little name and they say on the other side, "We will not let America first dominate." They should really say, "We don't like Trump's policies." But you don't say, "We don't want America first." And then they go after MAGA all the time.

Donald Trump 00:04:44-00:05:09 (25 sec)
We will stop MAGA. Well, MAGA means make America great again. They're pretty tough to stop JD and good luck. Hey JD, you have some very good polls I saw today. What the hell am I doing here? Goodnight, everybody. We can make this one real short, JD. Would you like to just do it for a quickie or do you want to go through the whole deal?

Donald Trump 00:05:09-00:05:35 (26 sec)
Uncle Sam, what do you want to do, Uncle Sam? We love Uncle Sam. We have incredible women here from North Carolina and they were with us yesterday in Miami. Did you see where we had a tropical storm and it came down, I've never had rain like that. I've never seen anything like it. Everything was so beautiful and we did it for Marco Rubio, and he is doing really well.

Donald Trump 00:05:35-00:05:57 (22 sec)
I will tell you, he's doing really well. Our people are doing well, JD. But all of a sudden the song went off. You know the song, people love it. They love that last -- Do you like it? I like it. I like doing it. To me it's beautiful. Would anybody like to see me stop doing that? We'll do a poll, free poll.

Donald Trump 00:05:57-00:06:22 (25 sec)
So who wants to do it? And who doesn't want to do it? So you know what I just did? I saved a million dollars to a pollster. No, they interviewed 203 people and they tell you that's a much better poll. I agree. No, it was beautiful. But the music went on and it was like somebody took a large pale of water and dropped it on my head.

Donald Trump 00:06:22-00:06:43 (22 sec)
And we said, I had a problem because the teleprompters were useless. They were absolutely useless. They went out and I'm stuck up there with 25 minutes to go and had a choice. And they said, "Please come off the stage." Security, please come off the stage. Well, there was no lightning, so we didn't have danger, but I've never seen anything.

Donald Trump 00:06:43-00:07:04 (21 sec)
This was like the worst shower you've ever taken. It was just pouring. And in Florida it goes like that for about 10 or 15 minutes and it stops, the sun comes out. It's very quick, but it's brutal. So I'm doing it and I had to throw away the teleprompters and we did so well, and I was saying, "What do you think would've happened to Biden if that happened?" I don't think it would've been too good.

Donald Trump 00:07:04-00:07:24 (20 sec)
I don't think it would've been too good. But the people, it was actually, people have said today, it was like a religious experience. The people, the music comes on and then boom, we just got -- It was like unbelievable. I've never seen anything like it. The teleprompter, one of them just crashed and broke.

Donald Trump 00:07:24-00:07:45 (21 sec)
The other one was useless because you ever ride in your car where you get a really heavy rainstorm and try and see through without the windshield wipers, which by the way, they planned. It's called planned obsolescence. They can make a windshield wiper that would last 100 years, but they make them only so they last exactly one year and then you have to buy a new one, which means they're smart.

Donald Trump 00:07:45-00:08:05 (20 sec)
Let's let them keep doing. But do you ever do that where you're driving and you can't see? Well, that's what I had with my one little remaining teleprompter. So we had it go and we had a great evening, one of the greatest rallies we've ever had and it was caused by God sending us the heaviest rain I've ever seen.

Donald Trump 00:08:05-00:08:32 (27 sec)
It was unbelievable. And nobody left. The media didn't even leave, the fake news. Oh, look at all of them. Wow, that's a lot of fake news back there. That's a lot of fake news back there. I'm looking at Eric and Don Trump. They're so lucky I allowed them to get into politics. They've been treated so kindly.

Donald Trump 00:08:32-00:08:54 (22 sec)
These are the two most subpoenaed human beings in history. Al Capone, you ever hear of Alphonse Capone, the legendary, Jesse James, Billy the Kid. These two have had more -- And they're really good kids. They said, "Dad, we got another subpoena from Congress. Maxine Waters sent us -- " "Because she's a very honest person, dad.

Donald Trump 00:08:54-00:09:15 (20 sec)
She's a very honest person dad." No, no, I think they set a record, most subpoenaed human beings in the history of the world. But the good news has been going on for six years. We're very honest. A friend of mine said, "You have to be the most honest person ever." Years and years, millions and millions of pages of documents.

Donald Trump 00:09:15-00:09:44 (30 sec)
JD, they checked every deal. They checked deals that I forgot about and I said, "I don't remember." I get a call from a guy. I did a deal 22 years ago. "Hi Mr. President, I just wanted to let you know we were just visited by the law enforcement authorities." "On what?" "That deal we did about 23 years ago." "Oh, how's it doing?" "Well, we sold it about five times already." People I haven't heard from them in years, they get visited by. These are sick people.

Donald Trump 00:09:44-00:10:01 (17 sec)
These are sick people. But this is what we're going through. JD, you got to get it stopped because that's going to be, that's the beginning of communism. It's the beginning of communism. I think we skipped over socialism. I say it now. You say "We're going to be socialists." We are not. We've skipped over that.

Donald Trump 00:10:01-00:10:24 (23 sec)
That's gone. Socialism is gone for about a year already I think. We're into the world of communism right now. Last year, an average of 14 Ohio lives were lost to drug overdoses every single day. Yet Biden and the radical Democrats do nothing to stop the lethal poisons pouring across our borders. And we had it almost stopped.

Donald Trump 01:39:05-01:39:40 (35 sec)
We will never give in. We will never give up. And we will never, ever, ever back down. As long as we are confident, united, and loyal to the cause, the tyrants we are fighting do not stand even a chance because we are Americans and Americans kneel to God and to God alone. The silent majority is back and stronger than ever before.

Donald Trump 01:39:40-01:40:21 (42 sec)
We will take our country back. My fellow citizens, this incredible journey we are on together has only just begun. And it is time to start talking about greatness, greatness, greatness, greatness, again, for our country. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So with the help of everyone here tonight and citizens all across our land, we will make America powerful again.

Donald Trump 01:40:21-01:40:51 (30 sec)
We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. JD, go get him. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
