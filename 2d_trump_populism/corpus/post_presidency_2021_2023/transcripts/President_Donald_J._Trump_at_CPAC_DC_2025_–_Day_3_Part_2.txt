 And I think one of the main reasons not that we're conservative or not that we're anything else. We are the party of common sense. It's about common sense, right? It's all about common sense. Over the past month, we've confirmed an all-star team of warriors, patriots, visionaries, and put the America First agenda into action. I see Doug Berger, I'm sitting right over there, he was so good. I looked at him, I said, I got to have him here. I got to have him. You know, he was a great governor. He's involved with a little thing called energy. He's got the Department of Interior, and Chris Wright has the Department of Energy. So Chris has no energy, and Doug has all of the energy. Chris has more interior, but he doesn't have... So I merged him. So now you have an energy guy, and you have the guy with all the energy, and you're going to drill, baby drill, aren't you, huh? Drill, baby drill. And Catherine stand up. This wife is incredible. She is such an incredible woman. Incredible woman. He got very lucky, Doug. It's good to be successful, isn't it, Doug? She's an incredible woman. He's an incredible guy. In addition to the great cabinet secretaries we have here today, we confirm Secretary of Defense, Pete Hankseth, to end the Woken Sanity and rebuild our military. Peter's fantastic. Thank you. To stop the weaponization of federal law enforcement, I know about that, I think better than any human being on earth. This week we swore in a new director of the FBI, somebody that everybody wanted. Cash Petal. Cash is great. This is popular guy. He went through. He went through with a blessing of a lot of good people, too. I'll tell you, it was great. To end the politicalization of our intelligence agencies, we confirmed director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who is something very respected, highly respected, and to make America healthy again, we confirmed Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Great guy. We need him. We need him. You know, there's a number on autism, as an example, with children, autism. And you go back 15 years. It was from 10 to 20,000. You had like one in 10 to 20,000. Some say 10, some say 20, but it was in that vicinity. That's a big vicinity. Now it's one in 36 babies of autism. One in 36. Think it was one in probably 20,000 people. Now it's one in 36. There's something wrong. Something's wrong. And Bobby is going to find it working with Dr. Oz, by the way. Working with Dr. Oz. Together we've achieved more in four weeks than most administrations achieve in four years. We made a lot of progress. I heard O'Reilly last night say Donald Trump for the first four weeks is the greatest president ever in the history of our country. That was O'Reilly. Bill O'Reilly is all right. You know who he said second was? George Washington. That's not bad. I beat George Washington. I love beating George Washington. Thank you Bill. On our first day in office, we declared our national emergency in our southern border. After years of politicians using our military to defend foreign borders while leaving our country defenseless and helpless, we deployed a group of people, active duty troops to defend our border and repel the invasion of our country. This was an invasion. You know, we had a great first term, a really great first term. And I called it an invasion. And we had great numbers. But now we have the best numbers we've ever had. We've never had numbers like this. We've done it all in four weeks. Think of it. That was Tom Homan, Kristian Homm, the whole group. One day one I ended the catch and release. I reinstated, remain in Mexico when I signed an order that will end birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens. Because it wasn't meant for these children. It wasn't meant for people that escaped or invaded, came into our country illegally. It was meant for the children of slaves. Because when it was done many, many years ago, it was during a very tough period in this country's history. And that was meant for the children of slaves. I wish people would understand that so they could get this thing approved. And we don't have millions and millions of people coming into our country and they shouldn't be here. This week I also canceled temporary protected status for migrants from Haiti pouring into our country. Pouring in. I weren't elected president. There'd be nobody in Haiti anymore. They were pouring in at levels. From other countries too, all over Africa, the Congo, all over South America. And they were coming in from prisons and mental institutions and insaneus islands, jails and gang members. And you'd have to see gang members, drug lords, people that a drug addicted, they were sending them all into our ridiculous and very stupid Biden open border. Our borders are with Kamala. Haven't said that name in a while. I haven't said that name. No, I haven't said that name in a while. Kamala. I'll bet nobody knows your last name. Nobody ever knows your last name. Even during the campaign, you'd have to say Kamala. It's French, you know, a little different name. Kamala. Because the last name was Harris. I used to say Senator Harris. Nobody knew who the hell I was talking about. So I had to go Kamala. But think of it, I was beating Joe badly, really badly. And they changed him. I'm the only one that ever had to beat two people. I had to beat two. Had to beat two. We beat two we. I didn't beat. You beat. You beat two people. No, he was doing better. That's like the great day in the white. He has a fight. And one guy's doing really badly. So when they take him out, they put another guy in the fight. The same guy that's, I had that. Never happened before. A lot of things we do never happen before. Do you ever notice that? We've the first in everything. So we beat two candidates. They said, who do you run against? We're in against Biden. And we're in against Kamala Harris.
