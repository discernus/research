================================================================================

 with me in the White House, I can tell you. On Tuesday, Joe Biden officially announced that he will seek four more disastrous years. As you know, I've done very well against crooked Hillary Clinton. But today, I'm going to do this, and I think this could be maybe the most important part of what I'm going to say, because this is going to be a major announcement. Are you ready? Is everybody ready? I will be retiring the name crooked from Hillary Clinton and her Monica. And I'm going to give her a new name. I don't know, like maybe lovely Hillary or beautiful Hillary. But I'm going to retire the name crooked so that we can use the name for Joe Biden, because he'll be known from now on as crooked Joe Biden. You would think that Hillary would be very happy today. I think she'll be, she's out there someplace celebrating, because there's never been anyone in the history of American politics so crooked or dishonest as Joe Biden. And the press absolutely refuses to report it all, that press back there. Because frankly, they're just as crooked as he is, and they are just as crooked. The choice of this election is now between strength and weakness, between success or failure, between safety or anarchy, between peace or conflict and prosperity or catastrophe. We are living in a catastrophe. With your vote on November 5th, 2024, we're going to crush Joe Biden and the White House, that gorgeous, beautiful White House, we have to take it back. We're going to beat him in the ballot box and we're going to settle our unfinished business. It's unfinished. Biden announced his presidential campaign by get this a prepackaged video. I was going to do that for you today. I'll do a little video, send it up to New Hampshire. You wouldn't have been very happy about that. But when you're running for president, you think at least one time you'd get up and say, I'm running for president, where am I going? Where the hell am I going? I want to get out. No, over there, over there. I'm going to get out of here. A prepackaged video that took supposedly seven takes to get it right, if right is what you want to call it. In it, he says he's running because Trump and Maga oppose a threat to democracy. Could you believe it? Let us explain. Maga is make America great again. No threat there. No, it's Biden who poses the threat to democracy because he is grossly incompetent, has no idea what he's doing. And basically, he doesn't have a clue, and that's a very bad position to put our country in. Our country is in very, very dangerous, in a very dangerous position right now. Very, very dangerous. We're now in a nation, and we are a nation in serious decline, a nation that has lost its way. We're led by a hopeless person, but we will win in 2024 and make America great again. We can do it. It's not too late. It's not too late. But we've got a year and a half to go. That's a long time with what's happening to our country. That's a long time still. With such a calamitous presidency, it's almost inconceivable that Biden would have even thought of running for re-election. He's destroyed our country, and yet he says in his recorded piece that he wants to finish the job. That's right. He wants to finish the job of destroying our country. But on that, he's actually very close. He is very close to finishing the job, unfortunately. One of the most important issues in this campaign will be which candidate can rest, and this country needs a rescuing. We have to rescue America from the wreckage of the Biden economy. Under my leadership, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. In fact, we actually did it twice because that horrible gift from China came over. COVID or the China virus as many people say. Actually, in New Hampshire, China virus is pretty much. But now we will do it again. We will do it again. We passed the largest tax cuts and reforms in American history. We cut more job-killing regulations than any administration ever also in history. We achieved American energy independence, and we were about set to do American energy dominance, bigger than Saudi Arabia, bigger than Russia combined times two. And we slashed the price of gasoline down all the way down to $1.87. A gallon, doesn't that sound good? That's why you have this horrible inflation because of what happened to your energy. Now everything's up. Now it's happening to everything. Thank you. Thanks to our policies, the typical New Hampshire family saw their annual income rise by $6,000. The largest increase in recorded history. The largest nobody has ever seen that by $6,000. Everybody was happy for decades, the corrupt, globalist establishment, savagely betrayed New Hampshire workers. You know that better than most. I see those beautiful factory building, summer now apartment houses and summer now senior citizens, but the factories, that's what you had to do, the factories have so many gone. You state lost one in four manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA disaster and China's entrance into the world trade organization. But after years of cruel sell-outs by pass-liters, I ended NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made. That was the worst trade deal ever made, what they did to us for so many decades and replaced it with the incredible USMCA, Mexico, Canada. That's considered now the best trade deal ever made. So good, in fact, that Mexico and Canada are now trying to renegotiate the deal with the Biden administration. I say, don't do it. Don't talk about it. Don't do it. Somebody over there told me it's unfair. I said, you know what, we lived with unfair for decades. Now they say it's unfair. No, we made a great deal and you're all manufacturers, farmers, everybody is benefiting. USMCA, we're very proud of that. Don't let them renegotiate. I would through from the job crushing trans-Pacific partnership. That would have totally destroyed this country. They were all set to sign Obama, Barakusay and Obama. They were all set to sign it. And I stood up to China like no administration has ever done before. Bringing in hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into our treasury from China when no other president had gotten even ten cents, not one president got. And I literally mean not ten cents. We got hundreds of billions of dollars. I don't think they like me too much, but that's okay. Well, everybody else is paid off by China, including by the way our president. It's a big problem. You wonder why he does nothing about China, why he doesn't do what he's supposed to be doing, because he got millions of dollars from China. You see it. I made big promises to the people of New Hampshire. And as your president, I kept every single promise. When China unfairly targeted our lobsterman, I gave them hundreds of millions of dollars and relieved straight from the money we were taken in from China. We took a little bit out, like a little bit of hundreds of millions of dollars, by the way, but that's a lot to a lobsterman. We brought it back. I made a deal with the European Union to completely eliminate tariffs on American lobster. You know that. They were charging us big tariffs so that we couldn't sell to them. The first EU tariff reduction on any product in over 20 years, nobody ever asked the EU if they did they didn't get it, because they're very difficult people to deal with. I want to tell you that. They don't care about us. They care about them. And maybe that's the way it's supposed to be, right? I also opened up 5,000 square miles of ocean that Barack Obama closed to New England fishermen. You know about that. But you also know I opened them up totally. Nobody could even tell me why they closed. I think it miles and miles of beautiful ocean front. And now I understand that they want to close it up again. Is that true? I can't. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Yeah, let Canada, let Canada do it. You know, Canada is the one that wanted it closed because they want to do the business. And I gave our farmers $28 billion out of the tariffs that we took in from China because they were treated very unfairly. I said, how much would it be they said approximately $28 billion? I said, I'm going to take it from China. I'm going to China pay them $28 billion. Who else is going to do that one? Okay? Tell that one to President. She... Your mind giving our farmers $28 billion actually better than that. We signed an incredible trade deal with China. But once COVID came in, I didn't care about trade deal so much. But it's a tremendous trade deal. $50 billion. And it was an amazing deal. But once COVID came in, I don't even talk about it. And everything I did, I put New Hampshire first and I put America first, everything. When I left office, we handed Joe Biden the fastest economic recovery ever recorded, all with no inflation. We didn't have inflation. We had low energy prices that kept it down. When he stopped the energy, stopped the drilling, you know, I have a sign, drill we must, right? They have a sign, don't drill. We will... They won't do it. They won't do it. What they're doing is crazy. And what it's done is raised everything. And now everything's so high and now they've taken on their own inflationary trend. It's not just energy anymore. But they did that with energy. They destroyed our economy with the high prices. All electric cars. Oh, that's wonderful. Everybody... They don't have enough electric to turn on the lights. And now they're going to say, let's do all electric. I love electric cars. They go for about an hour and a half. Then you're in the middle of nowhere. You're saying, how do I get this thing charged up? He took that booming economy and he promptly blew it to shreds. He took the greatest economy in history. It was just announced that in the first quarter of 2023, GDP growth was a very weak 1.1 percent. And the forecast show, it's going to be getting much, much worse. So we're at 1 percent in getting worse. That doesn't sound too prosperous, does it? Look at these other countries that are eating our lunch. I had them. They were doing anything they could. They respected your leader. They respected your country. I want to tell you, they saw me coming. They weren't happy. They weren't happy. Every time France or one of the countries but France in particular, they were a little difficult. I really like their leader but he's a very difficult guy. Whenever he got cute and wanted to tax our people or our companies, I'd just say, that's okay. We're going to put a 100 percent tariff on all wine and champagne coming into the United States. They would say, no, no, no, we will not do it. We have decided we won't do it. But I don't think they do that. I don't think they do that in this group here. We should have tremendous power. We have tremendous economic power that we don't use. But we better be smart because soon we're not going to have economic power. We're not going to have anything. Since Joe Biden took office, the typical family has lost over $7,400 in annual income. Think of that. Inflation is out of control. Banks are collapsing. Banks are going bad. That's a bad sign. You remember, 1929, it started with the banks. Real wages are down 24 months in a row, the longest losing streak ever, ever, ever in our country. Think of that. Real wages. That's what it's all about. It's real wages. The trade deficit is surged to a record $1 trillion. Household wealth is declined by $4 trillion. These are numbers that nobody's ever seen before. You know, they stand up at their third door. The economy is good. The economy is horrible. After Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline that I started and passed a $20 billion tax icon American energy gas prices in New Hampshire are up 53%. And your state, congratulations. You did have one good thing from this administration. You said a record, if you like records, but not like this. Your state has the highest electricity costs in the entire nation. Tell your governor he ought to work on that a little bit. You know that's the, you have the highest cost of the entire nation. I will quickly be able to cut that number in half or more than that. I'll do that. Nobody knew that. New Hampshire has the highest electricity cost. I think the highest energy cost, but highest electricity cost in the nation. Let's go to all electric cars. How does that sound, right? You have the highest electric cost in the nation. They don't want to give you a, they don't want you driving. You're like, how about driving for about an hour and 15 minutes and then it's time to get them, time to get a charge. Joe Biden cares only about enriching his own family. I care about enriching your family and you. A Biden victory will be bad for you, good for China, and truly great for these globalists. We've got a lot of globalists. A Trump victory will be bad for the globalists, the rhinos, the communists, the Marxists, but it will be great for the hardworking people of New Hampshire. Within hours of my inauguration, I will begin the process of terminating every Biden policy that is brutalizing New Hampshire and all U.S. workers. I will restore my famously successful executive order requiring that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. That was so successful. Do you remember that? When I did that, and I was actually getting 12, 13, 14 cut down, it was amazing actually, but they put many of them back, but they haven't been able to up your taxes yet because we have a very strong bill. We went through everything to make sure that nobody could tamper with it, but they're trying to try to raise your taxes very greatly. Instead of growing the size and scope of the federal government every year, we will shrink it every year with aggressive cost reduction targets for each federal department. But we'll take care of our military we have to. We have no choice. A lot of bad actors out there looking to do harm. We will take care of our military. You know, I rebuilt our entire military. They gave 85 billion of it to Afghanistan, but in probably the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, 85 billion dollars worth of brand new military equipment. I will create a true national trade policy like the kind that made New Hampshire a manufacturing and industrial powerhouse in the old days. Remember the old days? You see those buildings all over and you say, wow, I did a great job in renegotiating trade deals with other countries. They were the worst, the most horrible deals I've ever seen. I'd often wondered to myself, who the hell negotiated these deals? It was so bad. You'd like you say they were either like very, very stupid people or they hated our country. Could only be one of two. I think both. I think maybe both. Now the worst deals I've ever seen with Japan and with South Korea, Mexico, Canada, China, all of these countries, it was just amazing that how bad they were. You know, like South Korea, we take care of their economy, we take care of everything, we take care of the military, they're right next door to Kim Jong-un. He and I have a very good relationship. People would say, it's not good to have a good relationship. It really is. But he's not so happy with Biden. He says bad things about Biden. But what I really wanted to do, the Trump, we Cypricle trade act. What I want to know with that is that we'll go along with the Trump tax cuts, which they haven't been able to terminate because we've drawn them so powerfully under the Reciprocal Trade Act. This is, think of this, every country. Do we have any children here now? Couple. Close, close, such a good looking guy. Put your hands over your ears. Every country, he'll hear it soon enough. Every country is screwing us, right? So they've all charged us taxes and trade barriers. India, China, everyone. Europe, by the way, all over Europe. Under the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, if India has an example of China, Europe, any place, any country charges us, let's say 100 percent or 200 percent. That's what they do. You could ask Carly Davidson. You could ask a lot of companies that are unable to put their product into these countries because what they do, what they do, they make it impossible. We immediately charge them the exact same thing. It's called Reciprocal. Reciprocal. Reciprocal. So if India charges our companies 100, we charge their companies 100 is very simple. And yet we have people in Congress that say, no, I don't think that's good. Anybody that says that's no good, very interesting. Lindsey Graham, the progressive from South Carolina. No, he's a progressive. But he's got some good things to, okay? But Lindsey Graham, I said to him, Lindsey, you got to go along with this. We were all set to get it done. You got to go along with this. He said, so let me, let me get this straight. If they charge us, we charge them the same thing. He said it's not his strength. Other things are his strength. He said, so they charge us, we charge them the same thing, right? You got my vote. That's so easy. But, you know, we have guys in there that I guess campaign contributions are much worse than that. Maybe campaign contributions that aren't recorded. But can you imagine, but we were close to getting that done and then the election was rigged. But we would have had that done and done very, very quickly. One of two things will happen. They will get rid of the tariffs on us. They'll most likely get rid of them if you start doing this because we have countries that it's so imbal and so unfair. The deficits are massive. As an example, with China, $600 billion we lose every year. I got it down, way down. And then we had little, little surprise on an election and they're way up now. They're doing better than they've ever done. But they'll leave them. The United States will make a fortune on this and United States will make an absolute fortune, get rid of your deficits. And other countries won't go around saying we're stupid people because that's what they say right now. We're stupid people to allow this to happen. With HR just so we don't charge them. Cars as an example. In China, you make a car in America. Send it to China. You have to pay a fortune to get it in. You have to like nine different tax structures. They can make cars and send them in to us. We did put some taxes on them. I will tell you that. I was ready to get all of this past. And we had great support when we got hit with the election and we got it with the COVID and we got it with everything you could get hit with. And then we rebuilt it and we had the stock market actually higher than it was just prior to COVID when you think of it. It was amazing. We generate so many different things we did. We did a great job. We never got credit for that one. They give Biden credit. He doesn't always a life. I mean, see. Under the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, companies, factories and jobs will come roaring back into our country and massive deficits that we've been paying for decades and decades. And it will disappear. The deficits will disappear almost overnight. I will also revoke China's most favored nation trades. That is you believe it? They were given a most favored nation because they say they're a growing nation. Well, we're a growing nation also. If they're a growing nation, then we're a growing nation. I will gain total independence from China economically. I'll hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for unleashing the China virus upon the world. And nobody can pay the cost of what that costs the lives number one the lives all over the millions and millions of lives. But you're talking about 50 to 60 trillion dollars. China doesn't have it. Nobody has that. But something will happen. There's going to be something happening just like I got $28 billion for the farmers. Something's going to happen because what took place there is disgraceful. And it did come from the Wuhan Labs, as I said, from day one. Biden is proposing a $4.7 trillion tax hike. Congratulations. I, on the other hand, will deliver tax cuts, energy price cuts and interest rates cuts, the likes of which you have never seen before. Your interest rates are so high. Your housing values are going down. And the economy is doing terribly. Unlike Ron DeSantis, the Bushes, the Ryan's, the Roves, call Roves, he's another beauty, the rhinos and the Democrats, I will always protect social security and Medicare for our great seniors. I will end Joe Biden's war on American energy and immediately begin the process of expediting construction of new natural gas pipelines to New England. Again, you pay the highest prices in the country. You know, for a long time, the Democrats in New York would not allow a pipeline to go through from where they were coming through New York State where they could really use the jobs, really, really use the jobs into New England. You know what you get a lot of your energy from? Is Russia? They have Russian ships out there for years. They've had Russian ships. And if they did a pipeline going through a place in New York State that needs it so badly, they need the jobs. This would be a positive. And you don't see it. It's underground and the environmentalists and the governors. And once you get that done, I'll tell you, and I will do it. We'll do whatever you have to do. I'll get it done. It's a simple pipeline. New York has fought it off for years. It's not going to happen. Not going to happen. Your prices will drop in half and much more than that. You pay so much higher than anybody else. That's the reason. But we love New York other than that, right? Okay. Other than that. But now they have to do that. They have to do that. We're all part of a team. And if you want to buy a car powered by an internal combustion engine or a hybrid, or if you want to buy an electric car, some people like an electric car, like what? 4% of the people? You'll be able to do it long into the future. We're going to put it all back. And if you want to have a gas stove, you're going to be able to have a gas stove. Can you imagine them saying you can only buy electric cars when they don't go far enough? They don't drive long enough when some people don't like them and when the batteries are all made 100% in China or in areas that China controls? Who is coming up when we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country, including Saudi Arabia and Russia? But we're not allowed to use it. The electric car takes so much energy to create the battery that they won't break even environmentally if you're a believer in that. The making of the battery throws off more. Let's call it dirt into the air dirt into the air than anything you're going to do by driving one of our very beautiful cars around for a long period of time. So they don't say it. But very importantly, China has all the minerals, has everything you need to make the batteries. They're going to make it. We don't have that. We have everything. We don't have that. This is like opposition research. This is really incredible. When you look at it, I started saying about a month ago, I realized how crazy the borders ridiculous. We don't want open borders, April Fool's. Remember, it's like everything's April Fool's Day. All electric cars, April Fool's Day. I don't mind electric cars. You should have everything. Some people might like electric, some people might like something else, some people might like a motor scooter. Let them get whatever the hell they want. But to force them, when we don't have enough electricity for ourselves, you go out to California, they want all electric cars and you have brownouts during the summer and blackouts. The whole state goes out and then they say, let's hook up another couple of million cars. The whole thing is crazy. It's crazy. And that's why I say April Fool's. They don't want voter ID. How simple is voter ID? We don't want voter ID. Why don't they want voter ID because they want to cheat? That's all. Our opponents know that no one can match us on the economy. And that's the reason that we're way up in the polls. We have polls. I'm going to show you a couple of them. So today, a very respected poll came out. Emerson, big, big poll. It has Trump. Senator Christmas, CEO, CEO virtual audience. That's why I'm doing this. I had a nice life. I had a nice life. I didn't have to go before grand juries every time I fly over a state. If I fly over a state that happens to be Democrat-run, they send me a subpoena to go before a grand jury. These people are sick. They're weaponizing that stuff. But you know, these polls are amazing. So today is very, very important and big. Emerson Paul came out. So it has Trump at 62 percent to Sanctus at 16, Mike Pence at 7. Obviously, people are dreaming of energy independence, a strong military like you had, and borders and low taxes that are strong. We want strong borders. We want low taxes. We want low interest rates. We want to be respected throughout the world, not left that. We'll left that. You know, I said it as speech recently. They said somebody said, what do you think about you? I said he's a very powerful, strong man. He's at the top of his game. The fake news media said, how dare they say that? I said, what am I going to say? He controls 1.5 billion people. No, he's not at the top of his game. The same thing with other leaders. They're sharp. They're smart. They're at the top of the game. We're the only one that has one that's not. And he's not close. And he never really had a top of the game if you go back 25 years. This week's big morning console poll. That's another big one. Trump is leading by 37 points. And last week's, I don't know if you've seen this, Steve. He's a good numbers. Makes Steve's job easy. Don't assume that Steve. Just keep working because under the clarity campaign poll, a big one I lead by 45 points at 65 with desanctus being at 20% pencil for, and Nikki Haley at 4, and sloppy Chris Christie at less than 1%. Which by the way, is substantially better than he did seven years ago on the same stage against me right here in New Hampshire. Remember, he was less than 1%. So now he's still less than 1%. But he's doing much better. Got a big mouth. That's all he's got. In Massachusetts, your neighbor, 70% for Trump. And in the Florida voice poll, this is Florida. We're talking about 80% for Trump. 80% in a great place, South Carolina. We have a 22 point lead in the victory poll of Iowa. It's Trump 54, desanctus at 24, and in the new JL poll of New Hampshire, we're 33 points. Think of that one. 33 points up. I just saw that. That's pretty good. You're doing a good job, Steve. You're doing a good job. We're 51% with all these people running. All these people, 51, we're up 33 points. But we will not play prevent defense. You ever see the NFL? They hold a team scoreless for almost four quarters. They just have to do it one more time, one more series, and they say, we're going to go prevent. Touchdown, touchdown. We don't play prevent defense. It prevents you from winning. Prevent defense. Prevent you from winning. That's the worst defense. I don't like it. When I see, if you're with the team, and they go prevent, say, bet on the opponent. And then they want to do something on the debates. Think of this. They want a debate. I have people at 1 1 1%, 1 1 1% 1% 3% 2% 4% 7% and DeSankt is very low and crashing. He's crashing and burning. Don't forget when he came to me, he was at 3%. So he failed in this campaign. Then I endorsed him. I don't think I could have done without. But I endorsed him and he went up a lot. But he went up and he went. But when he campaigned for a long time, he failed. And now he's failing again, because now he's getting a chance to campaign without Trump, to put it mildly. To put it mildly. But so these debates, you know, Nixon and Reagan and Bush, Bush number one, others. No. They didn't debate in the primers. I mean, seriously, you look at the boards and you see these things, 1% 1%, 2%, 1% 3%, and you look at these numbers and I'm, we're at 60 and 70%. Why would you do that? You want intelligent people, don't you, to be running your country? But I do look forward to the debate with Joe. No. Correct. With crooked Joe. No, I look forward to that. Remember last time, I said, where and why did you accept $3.5 million? Remember that? Why did you accept, under the debate stage, I had that guy Chris Wallace. How's he doing? How's his career going? I know. Not too good. He always wanted to be his father, Mike, but somehow it didn't work out. It's called lack of talent. But think of this, remember in the debate stage? I said to Biden, I said, why did you accept $3.5 million from the mayor of Moscow's wife? And Chris Wallace, he did not answer the question. Chris Wallace said, you shouldn't be asking that question. Then I said, has it allowed to do? Why did he get $3.5 million from Moscow? He didn't do anything for it. And Chris Wallace stopped him from giving an answer, which he didn't have, by the way, saved him. They want me to go to the Reagan Library as an example, which is nobody knew this until I brought it up yesterday, which is run by a guy named Fred Ryan. He is the chairman and CEO of the Washington Post. Can you believe this could only happen? The Washington Post, the enemy of the people, the Washington Post, think of this, is running the Reagan Library. I think Ronald Reagan would be spinning in his grave. OK? But you say, how did that happen? But they want me to go. And sadly, your governor, Sannuno, doesn't register. I sort of a nest. It didn't nest, he guy. You know, it's funny. His father was very, very tough. But when I won, he became one of my best supporters. He really was. He really was great. But he was really tough. This guy doesn't have the same qualities. But think of it. He could have run. He could have had a Senate seat. Would have helped so much. You know, he's playing games. But Sannuno, if you take a look at what he's done, it's crazy. We're leading him, I guess, 58% to 7% in your state. You saw the poll. 58 to 7%. And now, if he ran for the Senate, he probably couldn't win even if you put him back in that same position. But he could have really made an impact. He could have run for the Senate. Would have probably easily won because of the family name. Would have won. And that would have been a tremendous thing. Instead, he wants to play games with the running for president where he's registered at less than 1%. I don't think he's going to make it. If he made it, it would be the biggest upset in the history of politics any country. We'll include every single country all over the world. And he should stop being a nasty guy and telling people that I won't win in the general election, which I will. Remember, speaking of which, we're leading Biden by seven points in Raspews and Paul. We're leading him by seven points in the Harvard Poll, Harvard Harris, and by 11 points in another poll. And by the way, the same people that said the same thing in 2016, well, maybe he'll win here, but he's not going to win in the general election. They love that. That's the only narrative they have left. But we're winning against everybody and we're doing just as well, just as well, in the general election. But it was the same people. I went in and I said, boy, I get killed in this. They say, he's not going to win in the election. And then I won. And then I won a second time by far more votes, but it was a rigged election. So what are you going to do? And that's the thing I asked Steve and all the people up here, because these are incredible people. I don't even care if you help me campaign. You don't have to help me. What I want you to do is help me on election evening, which is no longer election evening, it's election period. Because these people have like a month and two months to look around and play around with the votes, how people let this happen. We got to go to all paper ballots, voter ID, same day voting, one day. How about some of these guys? The votes aren't final until two weeks after the election. So how do you tabulate the result? What do everybody wait? The nation waits? It's a disgrace. What's happened? And I asked the people in stage, and we have a lot of people in the audience that are great politicians, and very important for your state, to I don't want to help. I don't even want to help with the vote. I just want help on making sure the vote is cast and counted fairly. Lenin. Lenin, did anyone ever hear of Lenin? He said, the vote counter is far more important than the candidate. Has anyone ever heard that's Lenin? Lenin, as they say in Russia. But no, the vote counter is far more important. It's very sad. We did so unbelievable that we got more votes than any sitting president by far. We got millions of more votes in Barack Hussein Obama. I was told if we got the same number, we can't lose. We got millions more, millions and millions more. Well, we thought we'd want to tell about 10, 15 in the evening, then all of a sudden we said, what's going on here? Now, we got to straighten out our borders, we got to straighten out our elections, because we're like a third world country. These incredible poll numbers are one of the main reasons that the Marxist left is coming after us using the criminal justice system for massive election interference. That's what they're doing. They want to weaponize law enforcement to interfere with our elections through the use of the DOJ and the FBI, Attorney Generals and local district attorneys, who actually they actually, you know, the district attorney we have in New York, he's reporting into Washington. They sent one of the top guys from Washington to help him run his office. That's very beautiful. Isn't it a wonderful life? But in the end, they're not coming after me. They're coming after you. And I'm just standing in their way. I'm just standing. I will always stand in their way. But we can't let that happen, because that's going to a lower level, even than what happened in 2020. That's going, in my opinion, to a lower level that even happened in 2020. And they're working on it. I got more DAs and people nobody ever heard of. We want the President in to testify. Or what? I have nothing to do with it. Well, we want him in any way to testify. Maybe he'll make a mistake. Maybe he'll do something. It's a disgrace. What's happening with our country is a disgrace. And it's a laughing stock all over the world. As the endless witch hunts and persecutions reveal, our enemies are desperate to stop us because they know we are the only ones who can stop them. They know that. There's never been a movement like this. By the way, in the history of our country, there's never been a movement like Mac. I make America great again. There's never been a movement like that. We've never had a movement. And with all of them, look, it's a lot of fake news. With all of the news back there, nobody's ever questioned it. If I say something and I'm like slightly off, they say, oh, he made a mistake. He's this, that, these people. I've never been challenged. I say it all the time. Are you hearing me? There's never been a movement in history, like MAGA. Make America great again. But unlike other politicians, the hotter our enemies hit me, the stronger and more determined we are. And that's as a party and as a movement itself. They hit me and we're all together. I'm with you, you're with me. And the hotter they hit, the better we do. You saw that a couple of weeks ago with these fakes, these fakers. In recent months, I've been laying out a bold, forward-looking vision for what we will do when we become the 47th President of the United States. Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. Would it never happen that war would have happened? I spoke to Putin about it. There was no chance that he would have gone in with me as president. And there was no chance that President Xi of China would have gone into Taiwan. I was the only president in decades who didn't start a war. You know that. Everyone said, oh, he's going to start a war, because they said I had that personality to start a war. They remember that? Oh, we can't vote for him. He's going to start a war. No, I used my personality that we didn't have to have wars. And I got out of wars, including knocking the hell out of ISIS, took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate. I said, all right, we're going home. Let's get our great soldiers. We're bringing them home. And the media said, well, why not 100? I said, you know what? We better finish it off, because they'll say I left early. And we knocked the hell out of them. That was the end of that. We took over 100%. We came home. But now I understand they're rebuilding again because they have no respect for our country. And I'm standing before you today. I am the only candidate who can make this promise. I will prevent World War III. I promise. That's going to be a war. And very sadly, there's never been talk like what you're hearing now, because this guy doesn't have a clue how to speak. He's too tough when he should be soft. He's too soft when he should be tough. He says things that are so bad. Provox. And then shows weakness. It's the craziest thing. He says just the opposite of what you have to say. I know Putin very well. I know she very well. I know Kim Jong Un. If I didn't take over from Obama, if he had another year, you would have had a nuclear war with Kim Jong Un of North Korea. You would have had a nuclear war. Then when I got along with him, everyone hated. The freight news hated that I got along. He got along. He didn't know the good thing to get along with a guy with 5,000 nuclear weapons. That's OK. But I did get along with it. I got along with a lot of people that people are surprised, really surprised. That's why we had no wars. And they would have never gone in. And all those people did in Ukraine. Far more than you think. Far more than they report. These phony numbers where a city has blown up. Buildings all crushed to the ground. There's nothing standing. They say nobody was killed. Two people were hurt. Hundreds of people, thousands of people were killed. These numbers are far greater and far worse than you here. When I get back into the Oval Office, we will totally obliterate the deep state. We will establish a truth and reconciliation commission to declassify and publish all documents on deep state spying, censorship and corruption. By the way, they spied on my campaign. They got caught. Can you imagine, if we let's take Barack Hussein Obama, let's say we spied on his campaign, you got caught. What do you think would happen? You think we just be some stories in only a few newspapers, because most of them don't even want to write it. They would have brought back the electric chair. That's what they would have done to disgrace its disgrace, unequal justice. And I will require every federal employee to pass a new civil service test. How about the President? Let's start with the President. Demonstrating an understanding of our Constitution. To stop the local Marxist prosecutors who released rapists and murder as well, persecuting conservatives. On day one of my new administration, I will direct the DOJ to investigate every radical district attorney in Attorney General in America for their illegal, racist and reverse enforcement of the law. I will quickly restore the most secure border in U.S. history just as we had three years ago. We had the strongest, most powerful, most secure border in the history of our country. Three years ago we had the most secure. We built hundreds of miles of wall. It worked, by the way. Then we were going to do 200 more miles of wall in certain areas where we could see it was a little weaker than we wanted it. We started that. It could have been finished in three weeks if he did it. We had the stuff ordered. He took it away and hit it so that Texas and Arizona couldn't use it. And that's what I said. I guess they really do want open borders, and they actually want open borders, and nobody understands why. Why do you want to have people from prisons? Why do they want that? Why do you want people from prisons and mental institutions and insane the silence? That's a step above. That's silence of the lamb type, okay? Why do we want these people in a country? Why are we allowing them? And you know, you have to see these other countries. They are, I mean, they've never had it so good. Their prisons are emptied out into the U.S. They have no more costs. They don't want to take care of these people for 70 years, which is what you could have. I mean, they have this MS-13. You saw what happened yesterday with this killer, this thug. He was an MS-13. The level of violence, they called it demonic, demonic. The level of violence is incredible. We have become a dumping ground for the entire world. The money they save, no prisons, no mental institutions. There was a story recently about a psychologist or psychiatrist, but a psychologist who worked in mental wards in South America. And he said, I worked 24, a good man. He worked 24 hours a day taking care of very mentally ill people. And he was sitting there reading a newspaper and they asked him what he's doing. He said, I have no more work. The people have opened. Let go into the United States. Can you believe this is what we're doing? How stupid are we? This is what we're doing. And this you pay for, I mean, sure, we can get a lot of them out, but this is what we're paying for and the crime that you have not seen anything. Why do you see this? But he said they've let them go in the United States. But this is not true with the three or four countries that we think of Honduras and Mexico or El Salvador. This isn't just that little area. This is all over the world. They're letting them in from all over the world. They're coming in. They're coming through the southern border. And we had it stopped up. One of the very first bills I signed will be for a massive increase in border patrol and colossal increase in the number of ICE deportation officers. We're going to follow the Eisenhower model. People don't realize it with Eisenhower. He was very tough on illegal immigration. A lot of people don't realize that. He was really tough on illegal immigration. We will use all necessary state, local, federal, and military resources to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in America and history. And they'll take them back to you know that story. They weren't taking them back. And I said, good, if they don't take it, they weren't taking them back for decades. And the generals came up to, sure they won't take them back, sir. I said, well, do we give them any money like any kind of subsidies or anything? Yes, sir. I'd like to find out. It comes back $750 million. $750, so I said, listen to three countries. I said, no more money for them starting this afternoon at five o'clock. The next morning I got three calls from three presidents of three countries. Nice people. This is hard. I don't hold it against them. They got away with it for years. They put airplanes on the runways when we're flying in with prisoners or MS-13 people that are, you don't want in this country, believe me. These are vicious, vicious, the most violent gang in the world, probably. It's definitely, and they put airplanes so you couldn't land the plane. So I said, how much $750? I say, here's what we're doing. Immediately you're going to stop payment of all money going to these countries. You're going to stop payment now. Next day I get three calls. The presidents of those countries, separate calls, totally. Sir, I understand there's a misunderstanding. Yeah, yeah. We want your MS-13 killers that you sent over here. We want them back. And we want everybody to go back to your country. We want them. We're going to bring them back. Sir, we'd be honored to take MS-13 back. We think they're lovely people. What seems to be the problem? No, no, we would love to take them back. Immediately opened up. Nobody has seen that for 25 years. It took me one night. We would be honored. We would be a great honor to bring back MS-13 so they can kill our people instead of yours. Now, it's terrible. The people that run our country are stupid people. I will ask every state and federal agency to identify every known or suspected gang member in America. And by the way, our police are incredible. Our firemen are incredible. Our police are incredible. And you know what? They know the bad ones. They're in the cities. These cities, these Democrat run cities are going to hell. The whole world is watching. But these police are incredible. They know the bad ones, but they don't want to lose their pension. They don't want to lose their wife or their husband. They don't want to lose their home. So they're told to stand back, but they know every bad one. They know everything about it. But I'll ask every state and federal agency to identify every known or suspected gang member in America and every one of them that is here illegally. The police know every one of them. We'll pick them up and we'll send them back home where they came from. They'll be out of here. And I will restore my travel band to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. You saw what happened four years. Four years we went. Four years. You saw that, right? We were very tough on that. We don't want our buildings blown up. We don't want to have problems. The Biden border crisis is also a drug and fentanyl crisis and a human trafficking crisis like never before, mostly with women, very sadly, mostly with women. And it's now at the numbers 12 times what it was three years ago, 12 times. We had it really that we were so tough on that, what they do with women and two women. Under my administration, we reduced drug overdose deaths to New Hampshire by 18%. And 18. And our first lady worked very hard on that. And I will tell you she worked very hard on that. And instead of being down under Biden, as you know, and your police environment do an incredible job, you have a real big drug problem in New Hampshire, incredible, almost worse than anybody, relatively. That's what the governor should focus on, not running for president, where he's at less than 1%. That's what he should focus on. But you have a real problem here. I have to tell you're a police and you're farming. I spent time with them and they took me around one day and the job they do and saving people. A lot of the job they do is saving people that have overdosed. It's incredible. The drug cartels are waging war in America. And it's time that America is going to wage war. That's what we're going to do. We're going to wage war in the cartels. We're being invaded. Our country is being invaded and destroyed. I will knock out the cartels just as we destroyed and knocked out the ISIS caliphate. The ISIS caliphate is tougher. I was told you couldn't do it for, you would take three to four years to do it in a certain way, I don't think we could do it at all. I did it in three weeks. I knocked them out in three weeks. We have great generals. I want not the guys on television that leave Afghanistan before they take out our equipment that our American citizens, where we lost 13 great people. And nobody ever says this, where many soldiers were just obliterated. Their arms, their legs, their face obliterated because of people that didn't know how to do their job. And why aren't these people fired? Why aren't they fired? And I will ask Congress to pass legislation ensuring that drug dealers, drug kingpins and human traffickers receive the death penalty. It's the only way you can stop it. You know, I went to China and I had a great time and it was amazing, amazing culture, frankly, and I was with President Xi. 1.4 to 1.5 billion people. I said, do you have a drug problem? No, no, no, no, no. No drug problem. I said, you mean with all these people you don't have a drug problem? No drug problem. Well, what do you ascribe the reason to, may I ask? I think I knew. He said, swift trial. You know, there's no games with it. These people, you know, when you meet with President Xi, he doesn't say, she had the Yankees do less. I know we have a lovely day. Lovely day. Isn't it beautiful out? It's so beautiful, Donald, it's so great. He goes, we will immediately proceed to work. And you know what I love that? I think that's great. There's no bullshit. Okay. I think it's great. We will proceed. You meet him for two minutes. We will proceed. There's no games here. How did the Boston Red Sox do today? No, they don't talk about that stuff. They talk about other things. But I said to him, so what do you think? He says, quick trial. Quick trial. You know what a quick trial is? They take the person. They try the person. And if they're a drug dealer, if they're selling drugs, unfortunately, they have the death penalty. And I don't think this country is ready for it. But they have no drug problem whatsoever. The big drug problem they have is they make drugs and send them into our country, like fentanyl. And even that, I had him set, except for this rigged election, he was set to make that a criminal, an absolute crime, with a death penalty for anybody making fentanyl. But once I left, once this horrible election took place, they sent more over now than ever before, he was going to give the death penalty. That was his deal with me. He was going to give the death penalty to anybody that produced fentanyl. Can you believe that in China? It's too bad. All these people are dying all over. We're being invaded. It's like a human invasion. To combat the scourge of homelessness, that is plaguing Democrat run cities such as Manchester, I would use every possible authority to get the homeless off the streets immediately. It's so bad, it's so sick. And you know, you have great hearts, especially the people of New Hampshire. And you know, you don't want to even talk about it. You don't want to say, gee, there's 15 people laying in front of my building. You know, you feel badly about it. But you got to do something for a small fraction of what we spend in Ukraine. We could take every single homeless veteran in America and take care of them. Likewise with all the money, we will say by ending mass unskilled migration. That's what it is. Mass unskilled. You see where in California now they're giving a medical care education. They're getting treated better than our veterans are treated. And you know, when they see that, they all come. They say, oh, you mean you're going to give us free medical? Can you? This is not even believe. California free and other places, free medical education. The classrooms, yeah, people that can't even speak English and they're sitting all over the classroom. It's killing our country. But we will have a huge dividend to address the homeless crisis in our own country. We're going to save a tremendous amount of money. We're going to take care of them. We will get the homeless into tent cities, shelters, rehab and mental institutions. And we'll get them off the streets of our cities. And living like that is no good for them, the homeless. And it's no good for the people that have to make our cities great again. You can't make your cities great when you have thousands of people laying all over the streets. To uphold our Second Amendment, I will ask Congress to put a bill on my desk delivering national concealed, carry reciprocity. And I will immediately restore free speech in America. We've lost our free speech. And we've lost our press. We've lost our media. It's so sad what happens to them. They don't report. It's not even what they report. They don't report. They didn't report the Biden stuff. They knew about it. They had the 51 intelligence agents. You saw that. Where they said, you're rushing to send information. We don't have to report it. These are corrupt people. This is this. And everybody knew that wasn't true. And we will take care of our amazing veterans. And we did it. You know, for four years, we had a 92 percent rating at the VA at the vet. 92 percent. We did a great job. The highest rating by far, by far, that they've ever had. On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our agenda. I will also support parents rights. Can you believe I have to say that? Can you believe I'm saying I will support parents rights? Can you imagine 15 years ago saying I will support parents rights. The people would look at you and say, this guy's crazy. Parents rights, of course. Who wouldn't support that? There are people that don't want the parents to have any rights, including the direct election of school principals by the parents so you can get people that you want. If any principal is not getting the job done, the parents should be able to vote and fire him, get him out, get somebody that will get it done. And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mass mandate. We did a great job, but we didn't mandate anything. The Democrats, governors, would run their states, and generally they did those mandates, and they were disasters, and a lot of them. They really didn't write Republican governors when you look at what happened. And I will tell you another thing that people can't even believe. I will keep men out of women's sports. You know, did you ever hear of anything like that? You saw the other day, the weightlifter and this young woman, 19-year record. Why, I don't know what it is. 200 and so much pounds. It's a lot for a man or for a woman to lift, but it's a lot. One of this records stood woman's record for years, 19 years or something. She got over the barbell. They put like a tiny ounce on one side, ounce on the other. This thing was, if you beat it by an ounce, you have the world record. And she got up there and, ah, should I do it? I'm going to do it. She couldn't do it. Then a guy came along who happens to be a woman now, according to the laws of our country. And he looked at it. They said, have you lifted before? Not really. Let's take a look. He looks at it. He has a record by like 90 pounds or something. It is so stupid. It is so unfair. The swimmer, you know about, right? The swimmer. She's a great swimmer. Great, great, great swimmer. She's going for the world record. She looked up and down. She sees young ladies that she grew up with. They're all great swimmers. They've been from the time they were born, frankly, because that's the way it is. They were good from the time they were born. Jack Nicklaus was a great golfer from the first day he picked up a club. That's the way it goes, right? You know, they were great. She looked up. She sees her friend. She looks down. Then she looked to her right and this is a huge person. Look like Wilt Chamberlain. Wilt the silk. He was seven foot one. Now, look like, well, with a wingspan, he was built like this. She was built. I'm sorry. Like this, most perfect body I wish I had a body like that. I would have been president 20 years ago. I had this body. It comes down like this. And she looks. She says, wow, whoa, this is, I wonder how she swims. And you know, the young lady was very seriously injured. You know that, right? Windburn. Windburn, because he went by her so fast. The wind was so great. She got a bad, bad windburn, but she'll be okay. Now, do you think, does anybody really believe what's going on in this country? I will sign a law prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states. And this is what we must do to save our country from destruction. 2024 is the final battle. If we don't take it over, we're not going to have a country anymore. I want to be positive, I'm just telling you, we're not going to, if we allow them to cheat, because it's the only way they're going to win the election, if we allow them to cheat again, you're not going to have a country. If you put me back in the White House, the reign of corrupt Washington establishment will be over and America will be a free nation once again. With your support in this election, we are going to complete the mission, we are going to finish what we started. We did so much, we rebuilt our military so much, but we have things to finish. Stand with me and together we will defeat the globalists, the Marxists, communists, and the rhinos, and we will also defeat the fake news media, because they're in on the end. We will evict Joe Biden from the White House. And we will restore the American Republic as the strongest, freest and most powerful nation. The world is ever known. We're going to get ourselves back there, and we're going to get it fast. They know me very well. They're not looking forward to having this happen, but they'll live with it. Actually, we got along with them pretty well. There were certain assets also. You know, other countries need a strong America, not just us. Other countries need a strong America. The USA is a mess. Our economy is crashing. Inflation is out of control. Our banks are failing. Russia has joined with China. Saudi Arabia has joined with Iran. China, Russia, Iran, North Korea formed together as a menacing and destructive coalition. Our currency is collapsing and the dollar will soon no longer be the world standard. Can you believe this? And that will be our greatest defeat in over 200 years of we lose the dollar. There's a really good chance that we will. But it won't happen with me, not even a small chance. Just like Russia would never have invaded Ukraine, like China would not have even thought about raiding Taiwan. Wouldn't have happened. They understood. They understood. Can't do that. I used to say that if you took the five worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up, they would not have. Not have done near the destruction to our country is Joe Biden and the Biden administration have done. But now I say if you took the 10 worst presidents, because I really believe that if you took the 10 worst presidents and added them up, they would not have done to our nation what this man and what this administration has done. And by the way, they're going to after this speech, they're going to become an after me big time. We are a failing nation. We are a nation in decline. That's what's happening. I hate to say it. It makes you sick to say it. And now these radical left lunatics want to interfere with our elections by using law enforcement. And we can't let that happen. With all of this being said and with a very, very dark cloud hanging over our country, I have no doubt that we will together win the presidential election of 2024 and make America great again. We're going to do it. Thank you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. God bless you. And now God bless me because I'm going to take a couple of questions. Where are we going to go with the questions? Do we have a mic at some point? Do we have a little mic? Go ahead, please. Yes, ma'am. Hi, I'm Elizabeth Girard. Thank you for the shout out early. I appreciate that. One of the issues we are super passionate about at the New Hampshire Federation of Republican women is women's sports and keeping biological men out of women's sports and out of women's bathrooms. We recently released a statement calling out Chris Papis and Ann Huster for voting against the protection of women's and girls' sports act. So how do we ensure that women can compete on an even playing field and feel safe when it comes to this issue? Vote for Trump. That's how you're doing. Okay? You're going to have no problems. You got me on that one before. It was even an issue. It's the craziest thing. And you know, it's amazing. It's such a good statement and or question. But so many people they hear, they can't even believe it. They can't even believe what's going on with that subject. No, no. You vote for Trump. That's going to be totally gone. Okay? Go ahead, please. Yes, go ahead. Yes, sir, Mr. President. Thank you very much. Frank Dawson and thank you for the phone call three years ago. I remember that. Thank you very much. You're a well-in-the-man. Thank you very much. I would like to ask you a question concerning the military. Do you promise the veterans out there guarantee them that you will make our military stronger as it was before you were pushed out of office and you will return and also make a promise to all law enforcement, all legitimate law enforcement that you'll protect and support them all the way? So I remember the call. I don't know why, but I have a good memory. But I remember the call very much. I appreciate the love with that statement, not just the statement. The answer is yes. We rebuilt our military. We have the finest equipment in the world. You know, we had jets that were 48 years old where the grandfather was flying them. Some of the bombers, the grandfather was flying them and now the grandson is flying them. Now we're redoing our military. We did a lot. As you remember, I made space force and they tried to end it as soon as they came into office and they had a revolt in the military. We created space force. That's the first time in 78 years since the Air Force. It's something like that's been done creating a new branch. So the answer is yes, 100 percent. You will be satisfied. Not only that, the veterans are very satisfied. 92 percent. But now, in other words, we added approval rating, the VA of 92 percent that's never happened before. That's a real job. You know, we got approved where you can fire sadist and sick people. You know, we couldn't, you couldn't fire them no matter what they did. You couldn't fire because of lots of reasons. I won't blame civil service. I won't blame unions. I won't blame anyone. You couldn't fire them. And we got that done. And we also got it done where you can go out and get your own doctor and we pay because some of the veterans, as you know, were online for weeks and months. Some of them became terminally ill waiting to get just a very simple procedure or prescription. They'd have to wait four, five, six, seven weeks. And we made it. You understand there's those two things were very important. The ability, we fired, I think, 12,000 people. They were sadists. They wouldn't attack these people in prime time, I can tell you. But they were sadists. They were thieves. They were, that's a very bad people. We got rid of them. We actually had that pass in the legislature. They've been trying to do it for 48 years. And then on the other, as you know, that was a big deal. If you have to wait online for any more than 24 hours, you have the right to go out and get a doctor, get yourself taken care of, and we pay the bill. And that worked out unbelievably well. You know that's true. That's why they like it. But the answer is yes, we'll take care of it. Thank you. Good to see you. Okay, please. Good afternoon, Mr. President. I'm Christine Peters. Also from the New Hampshire Federation of Republican Women. Good. And two of the top three issues that women are concerned about right now are inflation and inflation and the economy. How do things like the environmental social governance play into all of the economic issues that are facing women? Well they do. And you know, you have these fanatics, the environmental fanatics. I'm an environmentalist. A lot of you are very, you know, you want clean water. We want clean air. Nobody wants dirty air and water and other things. So, but they have to be reasonable. These people are crazy. They're putting windmills all over the place. They're going all over windmills. The birds that you want to see a bird cemetery. They're going to go under a windmill sometimes. And they're made in China just so you know, and causing a lot of problems, very expensive. But I will say this, we will take care of this inflation by going and drilling. You know the sign, they have con Edison in New York utility. They used to have a sign, dig, we must drill, we must drill. And we did some job. We had, we had it down to below $1.87 for a period of time gasoline. What a difference that made. When they came into, they closed everything down. They got rid of N war. N war since Ronald Reagan, they've been trying to eat. Ronald Reagan couldn't do it. Bush couldn't do it. Nobody could do it. I got it done. The biggest site probably in the world drilling in Alaska, they ended it the first day of the Biden administration. I mean, you think about it. They ended it the first day of the Biden administration. A site that would have been almost the size of Saudi Arabia may be bigger and they ended it. But we'll do it again. We'll get it done again. When you reduce the price of energy, everything else is going to come down. And when everything else comes down, what we'll be able to do is get the interest rates down and we're going to get our country back. Because our country, the way it's going right now, is going into a depression. We're going into a depression. Like in 1929 type depression. And we're not going to let that happen. But we're going to drill. We're going to get energy down. Everything else. We held it back. The energy became so oppressive, so expensive that everything went up and you had inflation at a level that you hadn't seen in 52 years. And it's still horrible. But we're going to bring energy down, way down. We're going to get the interest rates down. We're going to get back to a great life. We're going to strengthen up our military. And we're going to be able to deal with China and Russia and everybody. And they're not going to play with us. They're not going to play with us. Thank you. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yes. Go ahead. Is it not? Okay. God bless you. Thank you. Very much. God bless you. My name is Christine. I'm from Arkansas, New Hampshire. And engaging with young voters is crucial. Here in New Hampshire we have American first warriors like Caroline Levit. How do you plan? How do you plan to engage with Gen Z voters? Well, I think we're doing that. And I tell you what, you would be shocked like Charlie Kirk and others, the job that they do with their youth. It's a youth movement. It really is. That's another movement. You would be shocked to see how popular we are in college campuses. Much different than what you read. Much different than what you hear. But you know, one of the things about having this horrible thing take place with four years of, we've lived in four years of hell in this country in many ways, in many, many ways, more ways than you even know. But one of the things is they have shown how bad they are. And we'll be able to do things now to get it straight out. We have to make our cities safe again. We have to clean up our areas. We have to get things going in this country again. They've shown how bad things are. The voting is so dishonest. People see it. People see it. What you have to do is just have a little common sense. And you see the level of dishonesty because we want strong borders. We want great elections. We want strong elections. We want great education. And all of the things that have happened in the last four years have shown how bad these policies are. And it's actually in a certain way going to make it much easier for us. Okay, one or two more. Go ahead. Do you have anybody over there? What happened to that man with a mic? Let's go over here. Hi, my name is Tony. I'm here from the Cape, all the way from Cape Cod. Nice place. I just have a question on election integrity. So we're all here for lack of integrity. Thank you. That was going to be my next question. Election lack of. How are we going to take back 2020? I know we've got 2024, but we need to still work on what happened with 2020. And how are we going to make America great again? I'm taking that for 2020. The best thing we can do right now.
