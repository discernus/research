# Post-Presidency Transcript Strategy Assessment

## Executive Summary

Our comprehensive search for web-based transcripts of Donald Trump's post-presidency speeches (2021-2023) has revealed that **web transcripts are extremely limited**. We found only **1 working transcript URL** out of 50+ tested patterns.

## Key Findings

### 1. Web Transcript Availability: Very Limited
- **Rev.com**: Only CPAC 2021 speech transcript is available
- **FactCheck.org**: No working transcript URLs found
- **Major News Sources**: No working transcript URLs found
- **Total Working URLs**: 1 out of 50+ tested

### 2. Why Web Transcripts Are Scarce
- Most post-presidency speeches were not professionally transcribed
- News outlets focus on quotes and summaries, not full transcripts
- Fact-checking organizations prioritize specific claims over full speeches
- Professional transcription services (like Rev.com) only cover major events

### 3. Implications for Corpus Building
- **Web transcript strategy is insufficient** for comprehensive coverage
- We need to fall back to **video-to-text extraction** for most speeches
- The transcript-first approach will only yield 1-2% of needed content

## Revised Strategy

### Phase 1: Extract Available Web Transcripts (Immediate)
- Process the 1 working transcript we found (CPAC 2021)
- Continue searching for any additional working transcripts
- **Expected yield**: 1-3 transcripts

### Phase 2: Video-to-Text Extraction (Primary Strategy)
- Return to video extraction as the **primary method**
- Focus on high-quality video sources (RSBN, MAGNO NEWS, etc.)
- Use enhanced transcript extractor with Whisper fallback
- **Expected yield**: 50+ transcripts

### Phase 3: Hybrid Approach (Fallback)
- Combine web transcripts + video extraction
- Supplement with manual transcription for key speeches
- **Expected yield**: 75+ transcripts total

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Process the CPAC 2021 transcript we found
2. **Primary Focus**: Resume video-to-text extraction strategy
3. **Resource Allocation**: Allocate 90% of effort to video extraction
4. **Web Search**: Continue web transcript search in background (10% effort)

## Next Steps

1. Extract the CPAC 2021 transcript using our working tool
2. Resume video extraction for the remaining 74+ speeches
3. Document this finding for future corpus building efforts
4. Consider manual transcription for critical speeches without video sources

## Conclusion

While the web transcript-first approach was theoretically sound, the reality is that **web transcripts are not available** for the vast majority of post-presidency speeches. We must pivot back to video extraction as our primary strategy, with web transcripts as a valuable but limited supplement.

This finding validates the importance of having multiple extraction strategies and highlights the need for robust video-to-text capabilities in our corpus building toolkit.
