something I don't think
people. report I think it
was either party. There's
never been anything like
it and now we have
something coming up with
it going to go. for the
convention and they have a
couple of problems number
1. They have no idea who
they can take it is. and
neither do we that's
the problem. But we'll see.
Hopefully they get it
worked out. Sort of
interesting this guy goes
and he gets the votes and
now they want to take it

They talk about democracy.
them. But now we go forward
as 1 movement and really
we're doing a very we have
a very special group of
people like the people

on Just a little while
ago. in Milwaukee. and
tremendous honor to
officially accept the
Republic. nomination for
president. of the United

in 2016 and I meant it
100% but I made it even
more now because this
country has gone wrong.
really a left at failing
Nation right now. This
will be the most
important. election in the
history of our country.
This is going to be the
most important. election.
we cannot let people cheat
we cannot let this slip
by or we're not going to
have a country because I do
have other things I could
be doing It would be a lot
easier. Although I'd rather
be with you than sitting
on some gorgeous Beach
watching boring waves
coming. coming in. No, I'd
rather I would rather be.
actually, I would you know
that. I think that's
1 of the reasons we've been
so successful. together, you
know, I mean that too. But
we're going to make our
country more successful
than ever before yet even.
as We Gather this
evening, we will and take
a look. still at the
Democratic nominee. We
we're going to find out.
shortly. Maybe I don't know
what let's do this. Let's
do a poll. You know, I love
doing polls, right like I
do a poll. I do lots of
polls like Do you like?
make America great again,
or do you like America
first or do you like them
both? I like them both,
right? Let's do a polo.
candidates ready so I'll go
I'll go we're going to do
a poll in a few candid the
Press will like this
because it won't have to pay
for the poll. It's the
greatest guy. this guy
He must have a lot of money
because he's at so many
different rallies. and he
was at the 1 that was the
tough 1. and that was
something you were right up
in the front there you saw
that. that was something
we're going to do a poll.
and it's going to be
a very nice poll. and it
right. Who's your favorite?
candidate? Who would you
like? Let's do it. Who would
you most like to run
against because you know you
could say who's the best.
candidate? we're saying who
would you like to? We'll
start with. Kamala Harris
and then and then we'll go.
And then we'll go to the
Crooked Joe Biden and then
we could possibly discuss
if you So who would you
like? to most run against
if you're us if we
want to win. ready. Kamala
Harris crooked Joe Biden
Well, you have a terrible
Governor here who did a
terrible job. I'd like to
run against her actually. I'd
like to really go so. no,
she's 1 of the 20 that are
mentioned. She's the 1 that
gave her husband. full
right title and interest
everything but nobody else
could do anything but her
husband her husband was
saying in the middle of
your Lake. You're beautiful
Lake. He's out there sailing
and everybody else had to
be locked up, right? her
husband no, but things like
that are mentioned during a
campaign little things
like that. now she's done a
terrible job, but I hope I
be very happy with her.
at this very moment
Democrat Party bosses are
frantically trying to
overthrow the results of
Their Own party's primaries
to dump crooked Joe Biden
from the ballot couldn't
happen to a nicer guy. and
as you're seeing the
Democrat. Party is not the
party of democracy
there really is the enemies
of democracy. the parties
of corrupt. insiders like
Whitmer special interests,
and the failed. political.
class. That's what they
are under our leadership the
Republican party is now the
party of the people. where
the party of hardworking
Americans of every race.
religion. color and free. we
become a very big. party.
we become alright fellas.
You know what I'm talking
about. I love you guys. We
love you guys.
No, we become. we become a
very big party we have.
increased in size nobody's
ever honestly. in history.
like this movement and
that may be in the history
of the world. But let's
keep it down to the
country for right now because
that's the thing. but
there's never been anything
like Maga when Biden says
we have to stop. Maga we
will stop. man I said he
doesn't know what magazines
stands for it stands for.
make America great again.
How can you be against that?
How can you be against? and
you know the other side's
going around trying to
make me. sound extreme.
like I'm an extremist. I'm
not I'm a person with great
common sense. I'm not an
extremist at all. like some
on the right. severe,
right? came up with this
project. 25. and I don't
them I know who they are,
but they're very very
conservative just like you
have this sort of the
opposite of the radical
left, Okay, you have the
radical left and you have
the radical, right and they
come up with this. I don't
know. What the hell it is.
It's project 25. he's
involved in Project. and
then they read some of
the things that they are
extreme. I mean, they're
seriously extreme. but I
don't know anything about
it. I don't want to know
anything about it, but what
they do is misinformation.
and disinformation and they
keep saying, he's a threat
to democracy. I'm saying
what the hell did I do for
democracy? last week? I
took a bullet for
democracy. What did I do
against the Box? Hello,
Chris. Here's our great
campaign, man. Chris. Are
you having a good time?
there cool as a cucumber.
you know, so far they're
giving us great credit for
the best run campaign.
They've seen in years.
Isn't that nice? I just sit
there. Thanks. you. Try
doing it with another.
candidate sometime. It was
either the whole group. We
have a great group of
people They love this
country. They want to
save the country. That's
what we're doing. with
your vote. in this
election the Trump. events
Administration, by the way,
I made the right decision.
So great.
They were all good. They
really he's really stepped
up. but the Trump
Administration will begin
rapidly reversing every
single Biden. Harris
disaster. starting on day 1
and when you vote for Biden
you probably voting.
indirectly for Harris
anyway with you like it.
and I just common sense.
It's all common sense,
right? We will end the
inflation. nightmare that
you would have never had we
had no inflation. See
there's another thing.
but I know it's because and
even the radical left
reporters up there look at
have a lot.
cameras, but they'll start
turning off as soon as they
start mentioning certain
day. I'll say the red light
just went off. No, but
actually the radical left
reporters of which there are
it. I don't know why they'd
have them don't the radical
left reporter
say the guy's right, you
know it wasn't it until 2
years in. that we became
inflation is a country
Buster. It's a class Buster
it busts everything.
low income middle income,
especially. and they get
bussed. They're busted the
country Gets busted Look
at Germany from centuries
ago look at every country.
That's had. inflation and
greatest inflation. in the
history of our country.
They don't even report it
properly because they leave
the worst numbers out. They
don't talk about interest
rates that went to 10 11
12 and you can't get the
money. So what does that
mean to our percent of
you? Can't get the money It
means it's higher. from 2%
We will. seal the border
and we will stop this.
terrible invasion. That's
destroying our country. We
will crush. migrant crime
We're going to crush migrant
crime. Oh, we have a new
form of crime now. It's
called migrant crime. crime
now. It's called migrant
about these migrants coming
in. is they make our gang
members and criminals look
like
the nicest people you've ever
met. these people are much
tougher they come from all
over the world. Not just
from South America. We're
going to return. Law and
Order to our streets and
restore patriotism to our
schools. We gave you
already the largest. tax cut
in the history of our
country larger than the
Reagan Cuts but now we
will give you an
additional tax cut a number
of tax cuts that will
make it. we took in more
money after the tax cuts
that we did. prior we
took in. billions and
billions of dollars more
after the tax cuts that we
did we had the greatest
economy in the history of
our country Everyone knows
it. we're going to slash
regulations. That's what
created all of those jobs.
jobs. you know what they
called bounceback jobs after
Co they bounced back
everybody knows that when
you have something like Co
which you rarely happens,
but when you have something
like that they call
bounceback jobs and we're
going to bring down. Energy
prices vary rapidly. It was
energy that caused the
problem and their stupidity.
And we're going to bring it
down very quickly your
in half at least. in
coverage. some sections
like in New England.
I'll be able to cut their.
energy by. 607% It's
absolutely crazy. What has
happened with energy. We
buy the oil from Venezuela.
They used to be our enemy.
I don't know we buy from
oil. It's tar and you know,
there's only 1 refinery
in the world that can do
it. It's very heavy.
horrible stuff. It's
garbage. It's a tar you you
you lift it I said that's
not oil we want. light sweet
crude. We have the best oil
We have the best
everything. we go to
Venezuela, you know, where
Houston, Texas. It's the
only plant in the world
that can refine that
stuff. So we go to
Venezuela We pay them a
fortune We take that
dictatorship we make the
dictatorship wealthy. these
people don't know what the
hell they're doing. They're
incompetent. They're grossly
incompetent The biggest
threat is because we have
incompetent. That's the
threat to democracy. It's
a threat to our country.
we have incompetent people.
leading our country grossly
incompetent people. again
command the respect that it
deserves Viktor Orban. the
very powerful leader of
Hungary said when asked
what happened with the
world. that's falling to
pieces their Wars
of all over he said bring
back Trump. It'll all end
at all end it we had no
problem. in the world. and
something beautiful is going
to happen because we will
bring back. the American
dream and it'll be bigger
better and Bolder than
ever before. right and most
importantly for the people
of this great state.
you know years ago. They
gave me in, Michigan the
man of the Year those long
before. I was a politician I
was a business guy did well,
I like the state, but I
don't know I heard. a man
of the year, Michigan I
said, that's cool. I that's
good. I'm going to make
that trip I didn't know
why they were giving it to
giving it to me for
I guess. uh, the fact that I
employed a lot of people I
did real well. this is
probably 14 years ago. and
do you allow foreign
countries like Mexico,
you know, Mexico's like we
think of them as friendly
but they haven't been
to Friendly lately. How about
where they asked? Biden
where they asked? Biden to
meet just to meet they
want 2 billion dollars to
meet they wouldn't ask
that see they wouldn't
even ask me. that because
I'd say I will put 100%
tariffs on everything you
send into a country if you
even think about asking
they won 2 billion dollars
to meet. In other words,
we won't meet with you
unless you pay us 2 billion
single year. They won 2
billion
now, it works the opposite
of that. the exact opposite.
but you know when you see
happening to our country and
all you have to do is
know how to speak. when I
watched the way. our border
was handled we had the best
order the safest border the
border the saved my life,
you know, I was pointing to
an immigration. border
sign when I made this turn.
and that thing went that
way and said that way. so
I owe. immigration my life
It's true. It's true. Now
and think about it I'm
talking. thousands and
thousands. much more than
restricted because you're
in this giant Arena.
That's the 1 thing about
outdoor. That's good you
can have unlimited.
thousands and thousands as
far as the I can see.
Nobody's over here or
over here. Because there's
nobody there. It starts
like this. as far as the I
can send I said. look at
we had on immigration Just
look at them. if I didn't
say that. and it's because
we had like a crane holding
this. massive sign. I go
with the million dollar sign
that they're expensive. but
that sign was very good. I
think I'm going to sleep
with it tonight.
This is liquid. always that
that I looked I said,
that's not good. That's not
good. So it's a
immigration. if you think
about it, right? if
immigration I would have
never been looking to the
right and I had to be was
place that would have. saved
us they do. Uh, they do
these reports in the
New York Times and all over
the place where they had
you know, the the shape,
this way this way this if
every shot was no good
for me except for the 1
and came whizzing by and uh,
I hope we have to never
go through that again.
everybody. because it's so
horrible horrible but most
of your state this great
state I will rescue the US
Auto industry from
obliteration. They're
going to obliterate your
Auto. and anybody that? that
votes for the head of the
United. Auto Workers
This guy doesn't know what
he's doing. He's approved
you know Elon I love Elon
Musk Do we love him? I
love and I'm constantly
talking about. electric
cars, but I don't mean I'm
but whatever the market
says. and if it's 10% of
the market 12% 7% 20%
whatever it is. It's okay.
but you can't have a 100%
electric cars and you know,
so Elon. endorsed me
recently. the other day
actually. He's great.
Elon Musk He's a brilliant
guy every time I call him
he's talking about I got a
new idea for a rocket
you have to hear this. No,
first time I ever saw this.
I'm watching television
like 3 years ago and I see a
rocket. engine motor engine
come down Landing straight
up into no wings
No nothing and it's landing
and I thought I was seeing
things. What is that? And
it's landing on a barge
in the middle of the
ocean. and then another
1 comes down and another
1 another I guess more of
them came down 3 or 4.
and they land upright. I
said what the hell was
that? I've never seen that
before. now
wouldn't see that for
another. 50 to 100 years.
of that. And I called him
and I've always had a good
relationship. with him, but
I called him and I said
what was that? He said well
we saved the engines we
saved the engines. because
it's very expensive to
build. so, I mean it
didn't take me long to
figure that if you
saved them that's good. but
who the hell thought you
could do that. No wings
No nothing just like these
big long. massive tubes and
they're Landing. gently,
right on the DOT. I said
that's the coolest thing
I've ever that's and
you say how long would it
take government to come
up with that 1 I don't
think they ever heard of
it. Perhaps they still
haven't heard of it. But
you know, he's a very
Advanced person and he's
doing other things that are
great and so are other we
have to make we have to
make life good for our
smart people, You know, we
have some smart people
we have to make life good
for our smart people. and
he's as smart as you get
but Elon endorsed me the
other day and I read I
didn't even know this He
didn't even tell me about
it. But he gives me. 45.
million dollars a month.
a month Not 45 million.
gives me 45 million
a month. and I talked to
him just a little while ago
to say I was coming here.
How you doing? And he
didn't even mention it He
didn't mention. I mean
other guys they give you
2 dollars and you got to
take them to lunch. You
got to whine them down. No,
he's he's a great guy. He
really is but you know,
he's never mentioned to me.
Why are you hitting the
electric cars because he
understands I'm not heading
it. I think it's incredible.
I've had them I've driven
them they're incredible but
they're not. for everybody
some people have to drive
long distances. and they
tend to be more expensive
and you know. they'll
probably be made in China
because China has all of
that material. Oh, there's a
