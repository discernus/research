================================================================================

We are the United States. Well, thank you very much to the next vice president of the United States, JD Vance, who's doing a great job. You know, they go after JD. You know why? He's for the worker. He's for people that get out and they want our work, work, work. And frankly, they are people that have been taken advantage of it. He doesn't like it and he's done great. He's done great. He's been everything we could have expected and much more. So JD, thank you very much. I appreciate it. And thank you to Atlanta. I'm thrilled to be back in the great state of Georgia. I love Georgia. With thousands of proud, hard-working American patients. Crazy Kamala ultra-left. You know that. She was here a week ago, lots of empty seats. But the crowds you got was because she had entertainers. And it all sorted to unfold when they sorted to leave about 10 minutes into the speech. It was very boring. I don't need entertainers. I feel the same because I'm making America great again. That's our entertainment. Make it America great again. And I have to tell you, with thousands of people outside and the state was terrific. And the fire marshal, I will say, could not have been better. Thank you to the fire marshal. But the school administration stopped us from getting another 500, 600, even a thousand people in. Thousands of people were told, no, that was okay, but we could have fit another 600 people. So I don't know anything about the school. I don't know anything about this school, but they could have allowed more people. They got people standing outside. If you look at all the people outside, they could have come in. They could have come in. It's a beautiful school. It's a beautiful school. It's a great school. It's a beautiful school. And they could have come in from outside, but they could have come in. It's a beautiful school. I'm not happy. Hello out there. And then they actually pushed the people very far away from the building 94 days from now we're going to win the great state of Georgia in an epic landslide. And we're going to defeat Crazy Kamala Kamala. You know there's about 19 different ways of saying it. She only likes three. Biden never even came close. Kamala, she's good. Kamala. No, it's Kamala. We're going to evict this radical and incompetent administration from the White House that destroying our country. We're going to save our country. We're going to save our country. Yesterday it was announced that unemployment is surging with 350,000 Americans joining the unemployment roles just last month. Tell you what, we could end up in a depression. We could end up in World War III and a depression. How about that? Good happen to. Under Harris Biden policies, we now have the highest unemployment rate in three years. Just came out yesterday, even I was surprised. That's an up is with terrible. If Harris wins this election, you will quickly have a Kamala economic crash. You can have a crash. You could also have a crash like in 1929 more specifically because that's where we're going to have a crash. When we win, you will rapidly see a brand new Trump economic boom. It's going to be booming like it was four years ago. With your vote, inflation will stop. The illegal aliens will be turned back. They're not coming in. We've got to stop them. Did you see where she's now saying, oh, we had a very good border. Oh, great. They had a worse border in the history of the world. It's all misinformation. They saw they're good at that and cheating on elections. They're very good at that. The cartels will be crushed. Crime will plummet. Incomes will soar. The wars will end and the American dream will come roaring back bigger, better and stronger than ever before. Right? Yes. Thank you. But with four more years of Kamala, the California Socialist, you know, she destroyed San Francisco. Then she destroyed the whole state. Look at what's going on in California with your family and our country. It'll never recover. If you have any more time with these people, it's already I'm worried about the next three months. If you think about it, these people are grossly incompetent. You'll end up in World War III. I'll tell you. And I hope I'm not right about that. You know, you ever see the hats? Trump is right about everything. I don't want to be right about her. Her policies have opened borders and double digit inflation and fed inflation like we've never seen before. It's destroying middle income families, working families, all families. We'll demolish your life savings. 40 or 50 million illegal aliens will invade our country during the next four years of their end. 40 or 50 million. Medicare and Social Security. You know, she said she wants to put everybody on health care. You know, that's wonderful. It's all wonderful. First of all, they shouldn't be told to come here. Many of them were fine where they were. But no country can sustain their social security. We'll buckle and collapse. The suburbs will be overrun with violent crime and savage foreign gangs. That's what they do. You know, they're sending all their gangs into the United States, right? Look, there's Front Road Joe's. You didn't get into the Front Road. What happened to you? Oh, what happened? Thank you. We have Front Road Joe's. They've been to 229 rally. And then look at these people. These, I call them the beautiful ladies and you're not allowed to say that anymore. It's the end of your political career. You say beautiful. You're barely allowed to say ladies, right? Because that can also be destructive. But they're beautiful. They're ladies and they're great. And they've been to 216 rallies from North Carolina. They look happily married. I got to talk to their husbands. Way over 200 rallies and they're incredible people. Thank you very much, by the way. Thank you. Appreciate it. Together we will stop Kamala Harris's nation-recting, I'll tell you what, when you see what she's done to our nation, she's wrecking our nation. And the radicalism will take back our country from the worst administration in American history. Biden was the worst president in the history of our country. She's acknowledged to be the worst vice president in the history of our country. She doesn't have a clue. You know, she doesn't have a telepropter. She can't even speak. Did you see her the other night? They put a camera in a face. They can't even talk. We just went through four years. Let's not go through another four. Can't talk. That was terrible. You know, by the way, I'd like to congratulate Vladimir Putin for having made yet another great deal. Did you see the deal we met? Now look, we want to get people in. 59 hostages, I never paid anything. They released some of the greatest killers anywhere in the world. Some of the most evil killers they got. And we got our people back. But boy, we make some horrible, horrible deals. And it's nice to say we got them back. But does that set a bad precedent? Right? Does that set a bad precedent? Harris has the most ultra-left-wing agenda of any presidential candidate ever in history. There's never been anybody like this. She is considered more left-wing than crazy Bernie Sanders. Look at her. She's worse than Bernie. And she happens to be really a low IQ individual. She is the very low IQ. We don't need a low IQ. President Xi of China said, oh, good. We have another one, a low IQ individual. They love dealing with low IQ. They love dealing with low IQ people. And they got them here. I'll tell you. We got them all. Xi is terrible. She's worse than him. By the way, they really took it away from the guy, right? I don't feel sorry for him because he's a bad guy. He's weaponized the whole thing. Nobody's ever done that in this country. But he's a bad guy. But people feel sorry for him. They did a coup. He just doesn't know it. But actually he does know it. You know that. They said, Joe, you got 14 million votes. It's yours. But you're going to give it up. You're going to give it up right now, Joe. You're giving it up right now. No, I'm not. I was elected democratically. I was elected. No, you're giving it up, Joe. Where are you going to do it? The nice way or the hard way, Joe. You're getting the hell out. And it was the debate performance. So here's what happened under the debate. You know, we went. There was the highest rated debate ever. And, which was a great compliment. And as I left the debate stage, I took off because other people were entering the stage. You understand. I said, I don't want to confront other people. So we had a great debate. But as I left CNN, I won't say who. But they said, that was the single greatest debate performance I've ever seen. And this went on for two days. They were saying how great I was. On the third day, they didn't mention that anymore. They said he was terrible. I liked it the first way better. I made him choke. Don't kid yourself. We made him choke. He was choking like a dog. He was choking. He was choking like a dog. And that was the end of him. I mean, that was the end from that. Then they said, OK, this was a disaster. So then they started doing interviews with people that are, you know, 100% bought the media. The fake news media. They had some people interviewing him like George Sloppy Doppler's ABC. ABC is one of the worst by the way. They're also not bad when you get right down, but ABC is bad. And they were asking them, heartball questions like, where did you stay last night? Did you think you did well in the debate, even though you could, did you ever see a guy in the debate, you know, they give you like two minutes to answer. And you want to use it. You got so much fertility in there. You want to use up every second. And it answered a question. You have 92 seconds left. And I kept saying, I'll take them. And he said, oh, you have 92 seconds left. He goes, oh, this is not what he wanted. He left a lot of time on the board. But I went right down to the last second. I didn't want to go a little bit over because I know they got me. They would have cut me. But they were very fair actually seeing it shockingly, honestly. They were very fair. They want to do another one. You know, we're doing one with Fox if she shows up. I don't think she's going to show up. She can't talk. She can read a teleprompter. I'd give her about a six on a scale of 10, six. For talking, I'd give her less than a one. We need people that can talk. Comma, the pledge to give free taxpayer funded health care to all illegal aliens. How do you like that idea? Which will destroy social security. She called for the abolition of ice. Listen, ice. I know some people here, two of them are really tough guys. They're fighters. They're vicious people. They're good tough people. They don't want to work for ice. Ice will go into a pack of MS-13 killers and thugs. And for about two minutes, you just see fists flying back and forth back. And then they stand up and they win. And they grab them. They throw them in a patty wagon. They get them the hell out of the country. And she's calling them. She's calling them the equivalent of KKK. And she loves deadly sanctuary cities. By the way, all of the things you're hearing now, she's now denying. But you know, the one good thing about the internet, you press a button and you got it. Although they are trying to delete everything. You know, they changed the picture of me from a couple of weeks ago. And they really radicalized that they changed it. You know, using AI, they changed it. They had all the people on the stage who were angry and they were smart and sharp and very brave. And they had them all big smiles and they're like, can you believe that? They put the agents who I have to tell you and say what you want. Those people were brave. They were running to me and the bullets were flying. The Secret Service. They were very brave. They were very brave, I can say. They were very brave. They were running at me and they knew the bullets were going right over my head. At that point, the first one was not a good situation. That was really something incredible. That was from God. That was from God. Because the chances... Yeah, that was from God. For all of you non-believers, that one was for God. That was your close friend. But I just want to say, while I'm here, they were very brave. They pounced on me. They pounced on me. I heard those things whizzing over me. They were whizzing. And I have to say that because people take abuse and they were mistakes made. They were mistakes made. Pretty bad ones. But the bravery of that moment was incredible. And also, that the sniper, the Secret Service, who is a phenomenal, talented shooter, won bullet from hundreds of yards away. If he doesn't hit his target and he hit his target, boom. But from hundreds of... If he doesn't hit the target, then you have Corey and a lot of other people that are dead. Corey was great. Two other great gentlemen, warriors, great Trump people. We love him. And then they really... We thought they were going to be gone too. The doctors were incredible. They did a great job, an unbelievable job. But if that sniper, and he had five seconds to think, he did not know about it beforehand, by the way. He had five seconds. He saw the flesh. And he knew what that was. And within five seconds, he got off his shot. One bullet, think of it. And that was the end. Otherwise, you would have had... You would have had many people dead who did a hell of a job. And that was from a very far distance. That was from basically about tripled the distance. It was a long, it was a much longer shot. So we want to thank him and we want to thank all of the people in Secret Service for their bravery, because they were very brave. And this was a bad thing. Very good. But she refuses to even say the words illegal alien or radical Islamic terror. She says, nope. And the main thing, think of this. She wants to let mass amnesty and citizenship, she wants all illegals to have mass amnesty. Even criminals, because many of them that are coming in are for prisons and jails and mental institutions and sanosyelums, they hate why when I use Dr. Hannibal Lecter as the late great Hannibal Lecter. Oh, they go, look at all the media back there. Look at all the fake news. That's a lot of fake news. That's a lot of fake news, Bert. But what she doesn't want to get involved. Look, let's, here's a story. When a politician says something young in life, that's where they are. That's what they believe in. Defund the police. All the things that she said, that's where she would go if she ever got the chance. She's never going to get the chance. Our country will be destroyed. She's worse than Biden. She's worse than Bernie Sanders. She's Bernie Sanders, but not as smart. That's the way I have here. I said, she's a dumb version of Bernie Sanders. And actually further left than him. She supports mandatory gun confiscation. I'm sure you wouldn't mind that. Would anybody mind if they came into your house and took away your gun or your gun? Oh, I'm shocked. I'm shocked to hear that. She's for taking away all of your guns. The problem is they won't take them away from the bad guy. The bad guy's not giving up the guns. Good guys, I can go, oh, well, just spam. Here's my gun. Thank you. Now you're totally defenseless in your house. Now you can't do that. She said that a 70 to 80 percent tax hike is, quote, a bold idea that should be discussed. Oh, that's nice. She co-sponsored the $100 trillion green new scam. She wants to abolish all oil and coal and natural gas. We want to work on wind, wind. We want to have wind blowing. She vowed to band-fracking. She wants the government to stop people from eating red meat. She wants to get rid of your cows. No more cows. No more cows. Oh, it's serious. You know in Europe, you know you smile and you think about it. But in Europe, they're sort of doing it. They don't want any cattle. She wants to get rid of gas-powered cars and replace them with all electric. They don't go far. They cost too much. They're all made in China other than that they're fantastic. And I'm for electric cars. I have to be, you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly. So I have no choice. But he knows. No, I am for them. I'm for them for a small slice. There's a slice. But you want to have gas-propelled cars. You want to have hybrids. You want to have every kind of a car imaginable. They want to go all electric. And there's no way you can ever load them up. They call them loading them. You can't load them. We're going to have to spend $9 trillion in the middle west you saw. They would build chargers. Now, a charger is a gas pump with electricity come through. Is that good? So it's like a, for eight chargers, they spent $9 billion. Is that a good deal? So at that rate, it would be $10 trillion to charge up the country. The whole thing is crazy, right? Mr. Preacher, she wants to get rid of two very special words. And I came up with this because I noticed when you went into stores, I used to go into stores. Now I wouldn't want to go into stores because they have everything under lock and key. You ever see they have bars up. They have glass up. I don't know how you can do business like that. I'd like to buy a toothpaste, please. Wait till the clerk comes. You know, 25 minutes a click. They opened his heavy glass, armored door. How the hell do you make money doing that? It used to be that if somebody robbed your store, you would be very tough about it. Now, Kamala started this. Anything under $1,000 you can do whatever you want. And these guys are sitting out there. You ever see them? They've got paper. Okay, go ahead. That's over that. Drop that back. Put that back. There's no crime if it's less than $1,000. She's the one who started it. She's a lunatic. She wants to get rid of these two very special words. You remember I used to bring it up all the time in 2016. By the way, we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016. But these are mine. We did much better. They said, what was the difference? I said, well, we got millions and more votes. You know, as you know that too. But we're not going to let that happen again. Ready? The two words are Merry Christmas. She doesn't want anybody saying Merry Christmas. Now she's denying it. And then they found the tape last night. She's such a liar. She denies all this stuff. She said, I was not the bodhisars. She was the New York Times as a headline. Borders are. She was the bodhisars. She was the worst Borders are. She was the worst czar in history. Kamala's radical ideas belong in the San Francisco commune, filled with far left freaks. But they do not belong in the White House. They do not belong in the United States of America. This November, Georgia is going to tell Kamala that we will not let her turn America into a communist country. Remember I used to say we will never be a socialist country. Well, I was right. They skipped socialism. They've got... I was right. I was right. It will never be a socialist country. I'd say that. State of the Union. I said, we will not ever allow our country to be a socialist country. I was right. It's gone communist. It's skipped socialism. It never stopped. The train never stopped at the socialism world. The world of socialism is not a good one. But the world of communism is many times worse. Now that they've swapped out Biden, is he going to the Democrat convention? That's a big question. I'd like to go to watch Kamala get sworn in as they ripped it away from me. He took away his presidency. What do you think Mr. Congressman, you in a very good speech? Did he make a good speech? What do you think about ripping away the socialism there? What do you think about ripping away the guy's presidency? No, it's not democracy. Remember the words they use? They are a threat to democracy. They've been saying that about me for seven years. I think I got shot because of that. People said, he's a threat to democracy. No, I'm the one that is saving democracy. It's cruel. They're a threat. That's a threat to democracy. That's a threat to democracy. It's cruel. That's a threat to democracy. That's a threat to democracy. That's a threat to democracy. That's a threat to democracy. Wow. That's nice. Thank you, Marjorie. Now we're saving democracy. Wow. I'm going to use that more often. I've never used that. I'm always hitting them. I should say, instead I'm going to save democracy and get a nice pick. It is true though, certain phrases get amazing response like, I will keep men out of women sports. Now you find out, I'm right. I used to use the barbells. I said, now all you have to do is look at the boxers. This young girl from Italy, a very champion boxer. She got hit so hard, she didn't know what the hell hit her. It's a person that transitioned. He was a good, he was a good mailboxer. And she didn't even go down. He hit her with two jabs and she said, I'm out. How crazy is it? The weightlifter is a great job because they put a quarter of a downcier, a quarter of a downcier. And by the way, first lady of the United States hates one I do this. She says it's so damn unpersidential. I said, but the people like it. Right? I said, but the people like it. Right, Margie? She doesn't like it. She's a very elegant woman. She doesn't like it. Should I do it, Margie? So now, no, our first lady, she said, you know, your speech was great, but this weightlifting thing is so unallegant. And please don't imitate him not being able to find stairs because every time you do it, they say it was you that couldn't find this thing. Sure. I'm very careful because the press is among the most dishonest human beings in history. They know Bruce knows the great Bruce LeVell standup. He's been with me from before Iran. He was with me in 2014 saying that guy in New York should run him. He's great president. That was long before I even read. I didn't even know that. I think you might have convinced me to run. I don't know. Some of these people, you know, they've been, some people have been with me long before I ran. They would say Trump should run that we had Romney. Remember Romney? And they did polls. Romney and Paul Ryan, what a combination that was. Whoops, there we go, Fox. Fox just water. No Paul Ryan's on the board of Fox. What a mistake that was. But they had Romney and Paul Ryan. What a team that was. They got Robert. They got Robert. The choice of this election could not be more stark on the one hand. You have a radical left freak. You have a candidate who is fake, fake, fake. On the other hand, you have a president who will fight, fight, fight for America. Fight, fight. I will. I will. By the way the fire marshal, I love him. Could the school people allow there's some seats right up seats right up there they could let them come in. I don't know what you're doing. I don't know what you're doing. Let the people come in there standing outside thousands of them. Let them come in. It's obviously, it's obviously, Mark Jury of very liberal school, I guess, right? I'm not happy with this school. Let them come in there standing. It's 95 degrees out. Let them come in. It's some seats. I think thousands of people, they won't let them in. A Harris president, you know why? Because they don't want to show that we're successful. That's all they want. They don't want to show. She has to go get entertained and say start leaving as soon as she opens her mouth. Well, Hillary used to do that too. I remember she got Bruce Springstay. I'm not a fair, you know, I'm not a huge fair. I only like, I have a bad trait. I only like people that like me. Does that make sense? And these people like to be burnt, right? These people like them. No, no, Hillary used to do it all the time. She got the idea from Hillary. Hillary got Bruce Springstay. I'll never forget. And the place was pretty full, not full like our places are full, and I don't have a guitar. I don't have a guitar. I don't have a guitar, but our places at bigger, we get more people than anybody. I don't care how many guitars they have. You know, in New Jersey, we had 107,000 people come. Nobody has that. Nobody has. In Alabama, we had 68,000 people. In South Carolina, we had 82,000 people that had closed up the whole state. We even did one in the South Bronx in New York, rough place, but boy, it was, it was love. 25,000 people. It was love. It was love. But I'll never forget that. Hillary and she had Bruce, and they were all saying, oh, she drew, you know, 25,000 people or something. Then he finished with the concert. She started speaking and everyone's leaving. I said, that's not working out, so good. That's not working out, right? But I don't know. You have to be real. You have to, if people show up, people show up. Did you do that? I don't know. There's something pretty funny about it, but she had somebody. Who did she have? Who is the entertainer that she had? Yeah, yeah. That's what I think. By the way, the entertainer couldn't fill the place either. Even with the help of the school, the school's trying to get students, please go. This is embarrassing to us. Please go. Was it Hillary a beauty when I campaigned against her? She said, look at him. Look at him. Just look at those words he uses. He will start wars. No, no. I had no wars. I got rid of ISIS, 100% of ISIS, but that was already so. I was the one that had no wars first time in 80 years. In California, Harris was the original Marxist prosecutor. She was in the role of Fannie Willis. Has anybody ever heard of Fannie Willis? You know, Fannie Willis is a good friend of your governor. You know that? Your governor. I'm not a fan of your governor, but she was in the role of Fannie Willis or Larry Krasner, George Kaskan, Alvin Bragg of New York. He goes after me because of the Justice Department. Never happened before. The DA of San Francisco, Harris, shielded a legal alien crack dealers from deportation. She wouldn't let them be deported. She fought like hell. She wouldn't arrest criminals of the worst kind. She wouldn't arrest murderers. She wouldn't arrest anybody. The state has gone to hell. Gavin Newscom is the worst, one of the worst. Gavin Newscom. But she was the one that started it. She ruined San Francisco, ruined California, his California, Attorney General. She defined and redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person, an unconscious person raped as nonviolent. These were nonviolent crimes. We shouldn't even prosecute these people to help spring child predators and dangerous criminals out of prison all over the state. And during the left-wing riots of 2020, you saw that she urged her followers to donate to bail rapists and murderers out of jail while saying that the violent mobs should not stop. They should not stop. She said she was endorsing to fund the place and the police. And she said, violent mobs, let the violent mobs keep going. Let them keep going. We love what they're doing. We love what they represent. This is the lunatic that the fake news is trying to build up to be the next Margaret Thatcher. You know, you know, four months ago, she was considered grossly incompetent by the fake news. Now they're saying, oh, isn't she wonderful? Isn't she wonderful? No, she's not wonderful. So we have to work hard to define her. I don't even define her. I just want to say who she is. She's a horror show. She'll destroy our country. For years, she has pushed legislation to strip police officers of any protection. They have no protection. Anything they do, they get sued. They go bankrupt. They lose their house. They lose their family. They lose their pension. They ruin their lives. They want to ruin their lives. She was the worst at ruining police officers. And by the way, I have the endorsement of virtually every police organization in the country. And when I'm president of the United States, again, we will never defund the police. We will only overfund. We're going to overfund the police if we have to. I will always give our law enforcement heroes the protection, resources, and respect that they so dearly deserve. And like other Marxist D.A.'s, and she was the first of them. She was horrible. She was a very good friend named Willie Brown. I like Willie Brown. He knows more about her than anybody's ever known. He could tell you every single thing about her. Could tell you stories that you're not going to want to hear. Like other Marxist D.A.'s, Kamala, supports abolishing cash bail, which means bloodthirsty criminals that just kill somebody can immediately leave custody. Go out and kill somebody else, which by the way they often do, under these kinds of woke radical left policies, Atlanta is like a killing field and your governor ought to get off his ass and do something about it. Just a few weeks ago, two thirteen-year-old boys were murdered, and an 11-year-old was shot while sitting outside their house in Southwest Atlanta. In June, a 47-year-old man, a 69-year-old woman, and a 70-year-old woman, was shot in the middle of the day, shot right through the head, in the food court of Peachtree Center. What a nice name. In downtown Atlanta, where you can't even walk anymore. The shooter had been previously arrested eleven times, but they think it was 24 times. He'd gone to prison for assault and armed robbery many times. Since I was president, aggravated assaults in Atlanta are up 17 percent, and there's a 20 percent increase in shoplifting and a 90 percent increase in overall crime. Murders are up massively. Murders, you go to the store. I want to buy a loaf of bread, darling. You come back. Ma'am, I'm sorry, but your husband's been killed. He went for bread across the street. He's been shot to death, ma'am. Nationwide, there's been a 43 percent increase in violent crimes since I left office, including a 58 percent increase in rape, 89 percent increase in aggravated assault, and a 56 percent increase in stone-cold robbery. July 4th, weekend in Chicago, 117 people were shot. I'm not talking about, like, I'm talking about shot. Not aimed at it, missed, but I can guarantee that number was big. But 117 people were shot. Of the 117, 17 died, many are going to be incapacitated. They're going to be working for the rest of their lives just to move. Many of our, many are paralyzed. Many of those people are paralyzed right now. Nobody ever talks about that. So 117 people shot, 17 died, many very seriously hurt for the rest of their lives. If Kamala wins, it will be crime, chaos, and death all across our country. We're going to have just the opposite. You know, it's up to the governors and the mayors to run things, but with Minnesota, which was a disaster, many apalistic crimes. Remember the CNN reporter? This is a friendly riot. Oh, please, I'd rather not use the word riot. This is a friendly get together. And behind him, the whole city is burning down. Remember that? Remember it was like the flames were going like for miles. And then he got hit on the knee with something. I think it was a hand grenade that didn't go off. Remember him with the shaved head, ding, ding, ding, shaved his head. How do I look great? Then he goes down a hand grenade head. So how do I look, darling? Oh, you look great. They call it the summer of love. Remember? They took over Seattle 20 percent. If I didn't have the soldiers ready to go that morning, that Seattle would still be occupied. They actually took over a large percentage of Seattle. Portland, what they did with Portland, you know, I was in the most I love storefronts. Beautiful bronze. I love bronze and beautiful everything. Storefronts so beautiful. In Portland, you know, they have a storefront. Their storefronts have been so decimated. They use old two-by-fours with a wooden door, no glass, no windows. It's a worse looking avenue I've ever seen because, and I spoke to people that have shops there, they don't have many more. They've all fled. But the few people that remain, they have wooden storefronts made out of old lumber. And they said, no, anything we put up, including this will be knocked down the next time and it happens on a weekly basis. And nobody does anything about it. If I didn't bring out, they knew the military was coming in the next day in Seattle. If they didn't know, and they fled, they all said, oh, it's about time together. You know, when they were doing monuments in Washington, Marjorie knows this. I got an old bill because I doubt we could ever get Congress to pass one like this. And they were trying to rip down monuments. And then it was Abraham Lincoln. They were going to rip down the monument to Abraham Lincoln. They were ripping down other monuments. They didn't care who it was. They just wanted to destroy a country. And I took this old bill from 1889. Today, you wouldn't have the guts to sign a thing like that, although they should. They should make it even tougher. And it said, if you desecrate or even touch a monument in any way, shape, or form, you go to jail for 10 years. And there's no short incentives. There's no short incentives. There's no like you get nine years off for good behavior. You know, it's 10 years and you're not allowed to even do that. No judges allowed to do it. In fact, it was so old when I had a... I'm saying, is it an old sucker? This thing is old. But I reinstituted it. People were... It was so severe, frankly, that they didn't use it. And then I had a press conference, remember, and I announced anybody. And people were doing lassoes of those gorgeous horses and all the things up there. And yet you saw it the other day. They were doing it again in Washington, D.C. with spray paint into limestone and granite. You know, the limestone, it's a very porous stone. I was very good at this. That was a builder, as you may have heard. And the limestone, that paint goes in there sucks in a hundred years. You'll see that. It's nothing you can do. It just goes right in. It's very very porous. It's sand, basically. Beautiful sand, beautiful lions, beautiful monuments, the bells and everything. Desiccated. And I wonder what happened to those people. Probably nothing, right? Probably nothing. What they did, they did tremendous damage. They did tremendous damage. But so I announced this bill and the bill. I had a press conference to announce it. And I said, 10 years for anybody even touching any of our beautiful monuments. You know what happened? It was a beautiful site. I saw thousands of asses only the back, walking out of town, somewhere running. They didn't want to do anything. They just wanted to get the hell out of town. And that was the end of the problem. We didn't have any more problem. We had no more problem after that. There was no problem. And that was the end. You didn't hear about it after that. Mr. Congressman, did we? Collins. Good speaker he is. He's got a future. Does he have a future march? I don't know. Got the look. He's got the hair. Good job. I watched. Good job. We will restore law in order to America. We will bring back public safety to the great state of Georgia, which is doing very badly in that way. And on day one, we will seal the border, stop the invasion and send the illegal aliens back home. And we'll do it very quickly. For three and a half years, borders are harrowing. And again, she refuses to acknowledge that she was the borders are. She was the worst, worst manager we've ever had ever. And by the way, all of the people in Georgia, the border, they both endorsed me. They said he was the greatest president we've ever had. Tom Homan, you know, Brandon Judd, all of those guys, they've all endorsed me. And they said she's the worst. It's hard for them to say that. But, you know, they said there's never been anybody so incompetent. For three and a half years, borders are harrass as allowed terrorists and criminals to pour across our wide open border. And now she's denying it. Don't you can't fall forward. Disinformation. Denied, denied, denied, denied for a year. We'd never done nothing happened. We were great. We were great. We were so tough. And some people will start to believe it, you know. They used the word brainwash. Did you ever hear the word brainwash? Mitt Romney's father used that word. It wasn't good when he used that word. It destroyed his career. But they were brainwashed. Some people get, they hear it over and over again. How bad they were. And they say how great a job they did. They did great. They did great. They say it again and again and all of a sudden people. And don't forget it's not their main thing. Their accountants, their lawyers, their taxi drivers, their companies, their electricians. They hear it over and over again. All of a sudden they say she was really great on the border. Wasn't she? No, she was a disaster. She has destroyed our country. We're going to bring it back, but she has destroyed our country. She's incompetent. They're coming from South America. They're coming from Asia. They're coming from Africa and the Middle East. From prisons and jails. They're coming from all over the world. They're not just coming from South America. Everyone thinks, oh, South America, they want to vote at Spanish and they can like, but by the way, we are doing better with the Hispanic population, I think now than they are. So that's not working out too well. But they're coming from all over the world, not just South America. They're coming from the Congo and Africa. A lot of coming from the Congo, from prisons. Where do you come from, the Congo? Oh, what's your address? We live in prison. What did you do? Murder. Oh, welcome to the United States of America. It's lovely to come. The only good thing is, I say this all the time, these people are so violent and vicious that are being brought into our country. They're so violent, so vicious, that they make our gang members and bad people and criminals look like the nicest people on earth. So when we see an MS-13 some person now, we say, well, they're not that bad. These are the worst people anywhere in the world coming into our country. They're coming in at levels that nobody's ever seen before. There's nothing good about it. There's nothing can be made of it. And they're actually trying to get them to sign up and vote. They don't even speak the language. They don't even know where the hell they are. They want them to sign up and vote. And we have the head of our great Republican party here, and he is not letting it happen wherever you may be. Whatever you may be. You know that, right? They're coming in and they're trying to sign them up because I used to say like only two reasons this could be happening. They hate our country or they're stupid. Well, they're not stupid because anybody that can cheat on elections is that good, is not stupid. And they do. I really believe they do to a certain extent hate our country because, you know, why? But I never really talked about the third reason because it's so sinister, but they want to sign these people up to vote. And if they do that, this country is destroyed. We become a dumping ground for the entire world, and we're not going to take it anymore. Just a few months ago, right here in your state, I met with the devastated family. What a beautiful family of Lincoln Rally, the brilliant 22-year-old nursing student, Top River Class. It was out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia when she was assaulted, beaten, and horrifically killed. Her family was, I mean, look, they'll never be the same, incredible family. Kamala Harris let in the Savage Monster who murdered Lincoln Rally. He was an illegal alien who was in Border Patrol custody, but under Harris's policies, instead of being deported immediately and fast, he was set free into America. Please enjoy your stay. Lincoln's blood is on Kamala Harris's hands, and she was in charge of the border. There are many, many people like that. That is not the only one. Kamala is responsible for the death, as though she was standing there watching at herself. She was responsible, and for so many more. Three days after releasing Lincoln's killer into the United States, Harris went on television and lied to the American people saying the border is secure. What kind of a politician lies to Americans about keeping the border open while precious young girls are being assaulted and killed? And Lincoln is one where the press was, I mean, very strong on it, but there are thousands of people that are being killed and being criminalized and victimized by these people that are pouring into our country. I call it migrant crime. We now have migrant crime in our country. It's a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime, and it's vicious, and it's really bad. Kamala Harris should not be asking for your vote. She should be begging Lincoln Rally's family for forgiveness, and Joe Biden never would mention her name. You remember when Biden wouldn't mention her name, then all of a sudden, because Lincoln was really, I mean, that was a big deal. That was a very horrible, just horrific. And he wouldn't mention her name, and then he finally did it, and he called her the wrong name. Lincoln, right? Called her Lincoln. Good coach. Lincoln Rally. Good coach. Maybe that's what came from, but called her Lincoln. And he was so bad, such a bad precedent. Such a bad precedent and precedent was set by having him as a president. He was a disaster for this country. You get angry talking about it, because it's almost impossible to believe. You can be that bad. You know, people like certain people, and I understand it, they could have different beliefs, different policies. Like Ronald Reagan, he had something special about him. He had a, there was an aura, right? I didn't agree. I didn't agree with him on trade. I didn't think he was as good on trade as he could have been. Could have been tougher on trade. But he had something special. They all, he had somebody, they have, but this last group that there's nothing they have, they have nothing. I call him crooked Joe for a reason. He's crooked. I also call him sleepy Joe. He's sleepy. He's crooked. He's incompetent. He's dumb. And she's worse. She's worse. If Harris wins a never-ending stream of illegal alien rapists, MS-13 animals, and child predators will flood into your communities. If I win on day one, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history. Have no choice. We have no choice. No country can sustain this. We have no choice. And we will immediately expel every single criminal that borders our Harris has allowed into our country. No country can sustain it. In a recent CBS poll, 62 percent of American support large-scale deportation and others are saying it's 83 percent, 85 percent, including 53 percent of Hispanic voters because they see what's happening. By the way, the Hispanic voter and may have like this special relationship, I understand them. They're very entrepreneurial, very smart, but they also understand security better than anybody. And they don't want to have murderers released into our country. They don't want. It's very interesting. When I built, you know, I built massive amounts of the wall. The wall was incredible. We built it and hundreds of miles of wall. And they wanted it more than anybody because it worked. You know, remember I used to say two things work. You know, everything else is obsolete after two. You do a new computer in about three weeks is totally obsolete. Nobody wants it. Two things have never been obsolete. Wheels and walls. Wheels work and walls work. And you have a lot of different things becoming obsolete. But the wheel in the wall, the wall's work, Harris wants to be the president for criminals and illegal aliens. I will be the president for law-abiding Americans of every race, religion, color, and food. And it's no wonder the Democrat party and their thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them with the only ones going to be able to stop them. Nobody else is going to be able to stop these lunatics. All of their persecution of me is only happening because I am running for president and leading very big in all of the polls. If I wasn't running for president, I could be vacationing next to one of the many beautiful oceans of the world as the waves come in, beautiful, but it's boring. I'd rather be with you figuring out this mess, figuring out this mess that we've gotten ourselves into. We're going to figure it out. We've got to figure it out. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. We have to vote. We have to make sure that we stop them from cheating because they cheat like dog. I don't know if you've heard, but the Georgia State election board is in a very positive way. This is a very positive thing, Marjorie. They're on fire. They're doing a great job. Three members. Giannis Johnson, Rick Jeffries, and Genele King. Three people. A role pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency, and victory. They're fighting. Are they here? Where are they? Where are they? Where are they? Thank you. What a job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. But we have a couple of other members that aren't so good. We have some that aren't so good, but these three are really doing the job because they don't want to see this happen. That will destroy our country. They just passed a rule for Georgia elections requiring that three people at each precinct independently count the total number of ballots before certification. Who could be against that? Who could be against it? Thank you, Giannis, very much. That's really amazing. Thank you all. Thank you all. Those are great people. I'd say brave, but I mean to you, it's like that you got to do what you have to do, right? It's not like a question of brave. They said, that was brave two weeks ago. I had to do what I had to do. It's not like brave, right? We do the right thing. Go. Thank you. My courage was contagious. Will your courage is contagious too? Thank you. Thank you. Nice. It's amazing. People want it. That's what they want. Thank you, Giannis. That's great. Those three people are incredible. Let me give you the bad news. It's that for whatever reason, Brad Raffensberger and Brian Kemp, Raffensberger and Brian Kemp, your governor, who I got elected by the way, who wasn't for me, he would not be your governor. I think everybody knows that. It's very disloyal person, isn't he? Very disloyal. But these two are doing everything possible. Plus your attorney general would like to see him show up and do something, right? I mean, look at the look at the love and adulation and applause because this is like a poll. It's like a poll. We have thousands of people. That's better than going out and paying a half a million dollars to have some polls to go out and poll two hundred and twelve people. Look at this. Look at the love they have for Giannis. That's what people want. They want to have honest elections and they want to have strong borders. Very simple. But your governor, Kemp and Raffensberger, are doing everything possible to make 2024 difficult for Republicans to win. What are they doing? I don't know. They got something in mind. They got a little something in mind. Kemp is very bad for the Republican Party. He wouldn't do anything. You know, we have Bert Jones over here. We have Bert Jones. All he wanted in the Senate was to have a special resolution passed. And it was all done every Senate had wanted it, every Republican wanted it. And we have sent it to be here someplace. Still we're a Senate of the beach. Oh, I can't forget him. We can't forget him. A warrior. A warrior. You know that and many others in this group. But all they wanted was to have just a special. We want to go over the election. We don't want we want to look because there's too many things. And the governor wouldn't sign it. And I knew he would because I got him elected. I sent a young guy over to his office. Would you please have him signed this? And the kid came back. He said, uh, sir, he won't sign. Of course he will. I got him elected. Give me a break. Of course he will. No, he wouldn't. And then I said, we'll go back over. Tell him it's for me. It's a good thing. Not a bad thing. They want to look into possible election for it. Wouldn't you say, Senator, that's a good thing, right? They want to look into election for it. Comes back. Sir, I said I was for you. This was a few years later after I won the election. Don't forget, I endorsed him. And you had a very good man, Casey Kegel, your lieutenant governor. He was going to win easily. And David Purdue is David. I love David. But that was his only mistake. He said, sir, would you endorse a friend of mine, Brian Camp? I said, who's Brian Camp? He said, he's a friend of mine, sir. And Sonny came to. This was probably the only mistake of David's life. That was a beauty, David. That was thanks, David. I appreciate it. And I endorsed this guy. He was like way down on the list. He was doing terribly. And he immediately, you know, my endorsement means a lot. And I'm very careful with it. And I endorsed so many, one in a landslide. And then he said, I can't, I can't beat Stacey A. Groups. I can't beat her. She's going to be too tough. And she felt that too, by the way. She still feels it. You know, she's constantly saying she won the election. She can say it, but I'm not allowed to say it. I'm not allowed to say it. And Michaela, I love you, Michaela. I'm in love with Michaela. Please explain that to Melania. Please explain that to our first lady. You're fantastic. Now you're a special person. But I endorsed him. And then she said, I can't beat Stacey Abrams. He said that. And his wife said it to me. I said, well, you won the nomination. So let's do some big rallies. And I did amount it in airport massive rallies, 55,000 and 52,000. That may have even been a third. I don't know. I remember two monster rallies. And I said, you're going to win. He said, I don't think so. Sure. I said, no, you're going to win. I'm telling you, I can tell the vibe of the people. I'm like, I think David 287 and O in the last 12 months with endorsements. People respect my endorsement. And I respect them. And I love them. I love them. But so I had these two big rallies. And he won. He did when he won by like 2%. And his wife looked at me and said, thank you, sir. We'll never, ever be able to repay you for what you did. You got my husband's denomination. And then we beat somebody who was unbeatable. You know, she was in theory unbeatable. She was the hottest politician in the country at the time. Democrat politician, I would say I was hotter because I was president. So I was out of normal. I'm only kidding, Roger. I'm only kidding. Hello, maybe I'm not kidding, actually. No, she was like the hottest, certainly the hottest Democrat politician in the country. And she was going wild for years. She's still going once. She can't even believe it. But I got him by doing massive rallies. I really worked hard. He's the most disloyal guy, I think I've ever seen. But think of the wife. We can never repay you for what you've done, sir. We could have never won. And now she said two weeks ago that I will not endorse him because he hasn't earned my end. I haven't earned her endorsement. I have nothing to do with her. Somewhere he went bad. And you know what? Your numbers in Georgia are very average. Your crime numbers, your economic numbers, all of your numbers. You're at very average. You can do a lot better. And you'll do a lot better with a better governor. You can do a lot better, just so you understand. But I don't want her endorsement. I don't want his endorsement. I just want them to do their job for Georgia. And you know what? He's the governor. He ought to support his Republican party. Because if he's not, if he doesn't have his Republican party, I could tell you where he came from. And it wasn't good. And you have a great leader of the Republican party right here. Stand up please. He has done an unbelievable job. And he has to work like hell with a governor that doesn't help him. And Rathansberger ought to make sure that the vote is on us. And they don't want the vote to be honest. In my opinion, they want us to lose. That's actually my opinion. And we can't let that happen. Because if we lose Georgia, we lose the whole thing and our country goes to hell. Because we can't have her be president of the United States. She's grossly incompetent. We can't let that happen. They're the ones don't forget who got Fannie Willis and her lover boy, boy friend, old jazzed up. This guy, the governor, the governor, you know what? She's an embarrassment to the state of Georgia. He's the governor of Georgia. He ought to do something. Many, many people, their lives have been forget about me. Many people, I'm used to it. True. I'm used to fake crap that goes on with these politicians. But many, many people, their lives have been destroyed because of Fannie, F-A-N-I, Fannie. You have to pronounce it funny. It's called Fannie. You have to pronounce Fannie. I don't know how she gets. She should add a little U in there someplace if she wants people to call her. Now her and her lover, right? Loverboy Wade. She hired him because of experience. Paid him almost a million dollars a year for experience. He's got great experience. He never did a thing like this in his life. He never, he knew nothing about it. The only thing he knew about was something else. He knew about that. That's all he knew about that. He didn't know a damn thing. Do you know him? Have you ever met him? A couple of times. You ever see the phone records? Phone calls being made at three o'clock in the morning like every single night phone call, phone call from her house. And he said, no, not well. I don't know how to do that. No. And this governor, I assume, I don't know, he could straighten it out because his state has become a laughing stock over it. And you know what? I love this state. I won this state twice in my opinion. Once, once I won, and I did much better the second time. And Bert knows it and beach knows it and everybody else knows it. He could have ended the travesty with a phone call because I did nothing wrong and neither did all of those good people that are being persecuted. People in their 80s, they saw something, you know, because they see what's going on. I guarantee if I took a vote of this audience, if I said, what do you think? I won't, I won't do that. You know, they'll come in and dite you if you say that, right? Now they can say, it's Stacey Abrams can say that she won the election is fine. But if we say we won the election and we did, that's not fine. We can't do it. Hillary Clinton is still complaining about the election, even though she called me up that night and conceded it. But Hillary Clinton is constantly complaining about it. Nothing happens to her. We have two sides of justice and we can't do it anymore. We have to get back to making America great again. We don't have time for this nonsense. I mean, Vony wanted to indict a certain U.S. senator who had nothing. He say why are they calling me? I won't use his name because I don't want to hurt him. But she wanted to indict and somebody along the way stopped her from doing it. She had many, many more people. She was going to indict almost everybody that came into the state for a visit. But Camp doesn't want to end it because he's a bad guy. He's a disloyal guy and he's a very average governor. Little Brian, little Brian, bad guy. But think of it. I got this guy, just think, and then that's it. I got this guy nominated. I then got him elected without me. He doesn't get nominated and he doesn't get elected. He had no chance of winning either one. And all he had to do is sign something where the Senate would like to look at election integrity. This is an honest man. That's an honest man. They were all honest. They were looking at something very legitimate. And this bad guy said, I'm sorry, sir. I can't do it. I called him and I said, Brian, they're looking at election integrity. Is there anything you could do? I'm sorry, sir. I can't get involved in that. I said, but Brian, you don't understand. This is a good thing, not a bad thing. I'm sorry, I can't get involved. I've had you up to here, Brian. I've had you up to here. He's a bad guy and he's not doing this country a good service. People are looking at Georgia with Fonney and her lover and all of the other things saying, what the hell is going on in Georgia? What the hell is going on? The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we're not going to let them rig the presidential election in 2024. Every time the radical left Democrats marx is communist fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor. I do because I'm being indicted for you. You know, my father and mother are looking down. They were great people. They're saying, my son got indicted like four times. Al Capone didn't get indicted for what time. He would kill you if he didn't like your look. If you looked at him in this slightly, that's a nice shirt. Scarface, Al Capone. The most evil man, he didn't get indicted like Trump. I get indicted for what? I'm protesting an election that was rigged. This guy didn't get indicted. My father would say, but Al Fons Capone didn't get indicted. He killed hundreds of people. If he took you out for dinner, even you see you too. Guys, would you stand up with a mega black please? Stand up please. Look at these two guys. Who the hell is going to mess with them? Mega black. Mega black. I love them. I like them better than you, Bruce. Now those are two tough cookies, but of Al Fons Capone didn't like you because you insulted him slightly at dinner. That was the interview, fellas. I have to tell you. And he didn't get like me. Think of it. How crazy is the world? And thank you for being here. You're a good looking guy. It's better looking than Bruce. I'll tell you right now. Much stand up, Bruce. Never forget, thank you. But never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you and in the end they're not after me there. After you, I just happen to be standing in their way. So I want to introduce a few warriors if I could please and they're incredible people. They really aren't. You know, every night I do this where I get in trouble because I'm always leaving somebody out. I'm leaving a congressman out. I'm leaving a guy. It's brutal. So I end up going on the internet and thanking him and I love him and all the stuff or her. But you know, it's always tricky. But I know these are people that are here and I want to just thank them for joining us. You're a great lieutenant governor who's really great. Bert Jones. And his father is here. You know, his father is a legend in, he's a legend literally in Georgia as an incredible politician and then he left. He didn't lose. He left and he went into business and he's been tremendously successful. He really is a legend. His name is Bill Jones. Does anybody know Bill Jones? Bill? Where is Bill? Good. I saw him backstage. He's fantastic. Representative Mike Collins. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. Thank you. Where is the preacher that was back there talking to me? Where is he? He went with your father. Oh, your father's smart. It was that. Stays with those preachers. Rick Allen and Marjorie Taylor Green. Thank you. Thanks Rick. Great job Rick. Thank you, Marjorie. You know, I've known Marjorie from the beginning and she's an amazing political person. I don't like to say politician. She's beyond that. She's really loved and respected by so many people and in Washington when she calls they get very nervous. Oh, please. She's fantastic. So I thank you both for being here. Appreciate it. And a future congressman. He'll be one of your best. He's been with me for eight years. And you know, he always wanted to be a congressman. Then his district opened up and he said, you think I could do it? I said, you have my complete and total endorsement. Brian Jack. Brian Jack. Great guy. He's going to be a great congressman. So what he wanted to be. And he's he's fantastic. You guys are going to love Brian, right, Marjorie? Yeah. Also, we alluded to him and talked about him, but I'm going to talk about a very positive. He was really a great senator. He was a great man in so many different ways. He was respected more than anybody. I mean, everybody respected him in Washington. Very successful businessman that he ran for office, a little bit like the Trump schedule of events. But he was really a fantastic person in Washington. Somebody that I was very close to. David Perdue. David, thank you. Doug Collins, we used to stand up. Come on. How good was this guy? That's fantastic. Yeah, Glenn, I spotted him. I would have been in big trouble if I didn't mention him. You know, they give me a few names. Who the hell writes these lists out? These people, somebody's getting me in big trouble. It wasn't that way when I had Brian Jack do in this, I'll tell you, I got lucky. And I I see somebody that I know very well. One of the truly great members of the King of the Martin Luther King family. One of the greats. Will you please stand up? I didn't see you. My friend from the beginning, I would have been in such trouble. If I didn't mention you, I would have been in big trouble. Thank you, darling. One of the truly great people. I've been with us from the very beginning, I would say, right? Very beginning. Thank you, darling. Where am I glad I'm looking over this audience? I don't like this. I'm telling you, this would not have happened if Brian Jack were doing it, which he did for many years. Agriculture commissioners done a fantastic job. Tyler Harper. Tyler, thank you very much.

This young woman, I walked into, I don't know what the hell restaurant it was, but I walked into this restaurant and we do it very quietly. We don't announce it. That's for security reasons over there. I walked in. She's behind the counter and she didn't know I was calming and she goes, it's President Trump. You look at me. It's President Trump. You saved my college and I said, how to help you know that? She said, you are so, this one is so smart, so sharp. She grabbed me. She gave me a kiss. I said, I think I'm never going back home to the first lady. You were supposed to keep that quiet. See now for the average politician that's death. For me, I don't care. I just want to tell you, you are an unbelievable person with a great personality. You lit up the whole room. You lit up the whole room. I said weeks later, I'd go, who is that person that was so incredible? She knew everything about me. She had no idea where she was coming. She knew everything about me and you know the historically black colleges and universities, I gave millions and millions, billions of dollars to. They kept coming back and I said, why are you doing this? We gave them long term funding and she knew that because she said her college, which was, she loved her college. She said it was so great, right? You loved it. The illustrious C.A. You said that's right. She loved her college and she said, you saved my college. What was your college, Stella? The illustrious Clark Atlanta University. And it was so impressive and I felt so good because she really did. She really said, I said, did you like the college? She said, no, I loved that school. I love that college and that's what it's all about. But you are an incredible person. I think you have a tremendous future. I really do. And I'll do whatever I can to help you. Okay? Thank you. Thank you, thank you. You want to say something now? Man. You know, I thought I was done. But I do want to add on to some of the remarks that were made by others and we do need to do our best to get the message out there. The fight is nothing if all we do is talk about it amongst ourselves. So with that being said, since you said you'd help me, shameless plug, if y'all need anybody to knock doors, make phone calls, wave signs, get people out to the polls, call me at conserve the culture. Because not only do I mobilize the HBCU students so that they may get this message, but I'm the best person when it comes to black engagement and the black community. And nobody needs this message more than my folks. So do you care for real? Are y'all with us for real? Oh, my God. Conserve the culture.com for any and all inquiries. Y'all can follow me at Miss Kayla, baby. I'm going to give it back to Big T. And last thing, make sure you guys tune in to my cappacash dropping soon on the Patriots prayer network. Thank you all. She's great. Thank you. That's a great person, great woman. Thank you very much. From the moment we take back the White House from Kamala and Crookajyo and his Crookad is a $4 bill, I believe we're going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again. We're going to make it affordable again. Thanks to Kamala Harris's type breaking vote here in Atlanta. You suffered the highest inflation of any city in the country last year. Good job, Governor. Great job, Governor. Under Kamala, the typical Georgia family has lost $28,000 in inflation and to inflation hikes. To bring down the prices of all goods, we will stop the Biden-Harris war and American energy. We will American energy is such a big deal. We will drill, baby drill. We'll get that numbered down. We'll bring energy prices down. Everything else will float with it. We will terminate the green new scam and I will end the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate right on day one. It will be ending. We will pass massive tax cuts for workers and that includes no tax on tips, Makayla. To further protect Georgia workers, I will revoke China's most favorite nation's trade status. I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act of China or any other country makes us pay a 100 or 200 percent tariff. We will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 or 200 percent right back. You heard us. We heard you. It's an eye for an eye. We'll take in a fortune and they'll stop doing it before even arrive at the Oval Office shortly after we win the presidency. I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled and I will prevent and I'm the only one that's going to do it. 100 percent will prevent World War III which is very close to happening. I will restore peace through strength and in my next term we will build a great iron dome missile defense shield. Over our country, a dome like none other like nobody has ever seen before and it will all be made in the USA and much of it will be made in the great state of Georgia. And I will not cut one cent from Social Security or Medicare. I kept that promise four years ago and I will keep it again and seniors will not pay taxes on Social Security. We are going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety and beauty better than they have ever been before. We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington DC and clean it up, renovate it, rebuild our capital city so there's no longer a nightmare of murder in crime. We're going to stop the murder in crime. You go down from your state, you end up getting mugged and murdered in our capital. It'll be run tough and strong by our great police officers but rather we will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world. I could say again but it's been so badly run for so long. I almost don't want to say again. On day one I was signed a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial sexual or political content onto the shoulders of our children and I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. And I will keep men out of women's sports if that's okay. If Kamala Harris gets in the travesty that is taking place at the Paris Olympics will come to America when we host the Los Angeles Olympics and by the way which I was president we happened to get it. I was the president. I also got you a thing called the World Cup which is coming very soon. I might just say it myself because nobody else will say it but I got them both and you can have a lot of fun with it I hope. Harris is a radical trans activist and she is the candidate of letting men beat up women in the name of tolerance but you look at what's happening over in Paris it will never happen here. I will never let it happen. I will get all males off your daughters soccer teams and volleyball teams and get them out of your locker rooms once and for all that's going to be cleaned up and we will fight to make sure that the LA Olympics protects women and protects girls. I will fully uphold the second amendment and we will protect innocent life and we will restore free speech in our country. We don't have free speech any longer. And very importantly I will sue and this is so to me so important what we've been through in this country I will secure our elections our goal will be one day voting with paper ballots proof of citizenship and voter ID. But until then Republicans must win we want a landslide that's too big to rig. Too big to rig. If you want to save America get your friends get your family get everyone you know and vote. Voter early vote absentee vote on election day do whatever you want but you have to vote and if you want to help us ensure election integrity please sign up protect the vote dot com protect the vote dot com so in conclusion from Marietta to Macon from Savannah to Columbus from Augusta to right here in Atlanta we inherit the legacy of red blooded American patriots who gave their blood sweat and tears to defend our country and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who cross the ocean settle to continent. Tame the wilderness laid down the railroads raised up those great big beautiful skyscrapers one two world wars defeated fascism and communism and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. But now we are a nation in decline we are a failing nation we are a nation that has lost its confidence lost its willpower and lost its strength we are a nation that has lost its way but we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Less than four years ago we were a great nation and we will soon be a great nation again with our leadership every disaster Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have created can be fixed and it will be fixed very quickly every problem can be solved and every wrong can be rectified by this time next year America's borders will be strong sealed and secure inflation will be in full retreat our economy will be roaring back it's gonna be roaring back optimism will be surging the American dream will be thriving again for citizens of every race religion color and create law and justice will reign all throughout our land freedom will be restored the flame of liberty will be burning Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the worst administration in the history of our country will be a fading memory of the past and our great silent majority including the ones forgotten men and women of our country will be the one shaping America's magnificent future when I am the 47th president of the United States because we are all Americans and together we will show November 5th to be the most important day in the history of our country we are one movement one people one family and one glorious nation under God and together we will make a
