Wherever you may be wherever you may be Ted thank you very much. Thank you very much with the help of everyone here today we're going to win the state of Michigan this November we're going to fire Crook a Joe Biden. We are going to evict a Biden crime family from the White House and we are going to make America great again have you heard that expression. Less than four years ago our border was secure inflation was nowhere to be seen within have inflation. The world was at peace and America was stronger and more respected than ever before was never as respected as it was just four years ago now under Crook a Joe Biden the worst president in the history of our country the world is inflamed our borders overrun inflation is raging Europe is in chaos the Middle East is explode. Iran is in bold and China is on the march and the worst most incompetent person to ever leave this country is dragging us toward World War III other than that I think he's doing a very good job. Other than that he's doing a fine job now he's the worst under Biden illegal aliens are better off terrorists are better off China is better off Russia is better off the cartels are better off but the American people were far better off under a gentleman named president Donald J Trump have you heard of him. And in particular get go and remember this or wait a minute Mike Lindell please stand up okay I just saw him stand up forget about his pillows he is the greatest purchaser of advertising in the history of America if you could buy my ads I'd be blanketing the airways with it thank you Mike. We love Mike but in particular Michigan was better off with Trump bike a lot you were doing great companies were moving back and the car companies weren't moving out and you weren't under a mandate to build all electric cars which you could all be made in China it's just a question of a few years. For decades before I took office Joe Biden and his cronies in Washington got rich by selling off Michigan jobs and selling out Detroit that's what they did that's why your car business is so far down used to have a hundred percent of the car business now you're down to probably 30 percent by comparison to what it was. Truckage Joe back NAFTA the worst trade deal we ever had China's entry into the world trade organization other disaster the trans specific partnership he wanted that so badly would have totally destroyed the state the Paris climate accord where we put up a trillion dollars and nobody else puts up anything one of the most unfair deals sounds good but was it disaster. And every other globalist disaster that sucked the life and wealth and blood out of our country and that's what it was doing but after decades of Joe Biden putting America last Michigan finally got a president to put America first that's what happened that's what happened. I met a lot of people backstage just now and they're all saying sure we were doing so much better four years ago everybody was I stood up to the globalist I stood up to the outsourcers corporate lobbyists and special interests that's why they don't exactly love these people. And I live by the motto promises made promises kept I kept all my promises kept them all. In my first week in office I terminated TPP trans specific partnership would have destroyed your state would have would have really destroyed trade in our country and I withdrew from the Paris accord it was unfair the disaster. And I ended NAFTA worst trade deal and replaced it with the brand new US MCA that's Mexico Canada. In fact that deal is so good and so good for the American auto worker that Canada and Mexico are trying to renegotiate it as we speak they want to renegotiate it don't do it crooked Joe don't do it you know if they put up enough for him he'll do it. I stood up to China like never before bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue when no other president had gotten ten cents from China hundreds of billions. I imposed a 27.5% tariff on all Chinese automobiles the only reason that we still have any auto industries left I didn't do that you would have been wiped out by China completely and by the way whoever heads the United Auto Workers is doing an absolutely terrible job his name wouldn't be Sean Tain wouldn't Sean Faye whoever this guy Sean Faye is they want to get him out because he sold the auto workers down the tubes. They were sold down the river you won't have any yet you fired is right I said yeah fired how bad he agreed to what Obama wanted to do under my leadership we created half a million manufacturing jobs and three short years remember Biden and Obama would go around saying we can't manufacture here anymore. That's because we had stupid people leading our country. We lifted up all Americans black brown white and everybody else everyone was doing better everybody was doing great but now crooked Joe is doing a hit job on Michigan manufacturing and on Detroit the likes of which I have never seen before you know I got the man of the year in Michigan using a long before politics like 12 years ago. I said I came up and I thought the speech was good it turned out to be very controversial I said why are you allowing them to steal your jobs why are you doing it they're coming in these countries and they're taking all your jobs and right now Mexico is building the biggest car plants anywhere in the world and they want to sell the cars back into the United States they're stealing your jobs who would allow that to happen and you know who owns the car plants being in the car plant. I'm building built in Mexico China. It's crazy who would believe this. Thank you very much. Low IQ Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate will totally obliterate the US auto industry and it won't take long just so you know you know we have the greatest army tanks I saved it in Ohio a plant when I was president elected said sure they want to close our army tank plant makes the best tanks for the world I visited in Lima Lima Ohio. I saved it I said how can you do this I look the complex you'd never be able to build a plant like this turned out we made more army tanks than anybody they did a great job but they want to make them now electric so that when you go into enemy territory and you obliterate the enemy and you knock down on those tanks of firing you do it in a environmentally friendly way. The problem with the army tanks like cars and like trucks the problem is that you would have to bring a battery pack along you're going to pull it like a little wagon like a child pulls away so they want to build a army tank but you know the battery is very big and very heavy much heavier than a thing called diesel much heavier than diesel fuel and you got to see this tank it's like a wagon and there's a big thing that is pulling in the back. And even with that it doesn't go far and lots of bad things happen like it doesn't take cold weather very well and it's really bad in heat but it is environmentally friendly remember that of course making it is an environmental disaster so that more than makes up for it and they want to have your jet fighters now I got more plants I rebuilt our entire military they want to make your jet fighters use the fuel that's environmentally friendly. But it makes the plane 18% less efficient so that's the difference between in a fight with the enemy winning and losing a minor difference but you go in again they want to go in in a clean environmental way as we bomb the shit out of a country can you believe this? Who are the people that are destroying who are the people that are destroying our country? Thank you very much. Thank you. I feel very young. I don't know what it is but I feel better than I did 30 years ago I don't know what the hell is going on. I don't know. I feel very good. So we can't let these people destroy our country like this I mean they're going crazy today you read where they don't want to have any water in your dishwasher so your dishwasher won't work and they think that's good so what you do is you keep having a go on and on and on the electric bill is 10 times more than the water and these are areas that have so much water they don't know what to do with it they're flooding their floodplains they have so much water in many cases now we can't do that you know I ended that I went to in Ohio. Ohio a great company was going out of business because of the dishwashers they wouldn't give the water you couldn't sell the product and South Korea and China were dumping dishwashers in here for half the cost they weren't as good whirlpool but half the cost they weren't as good and I went and I saved it I put a 50% at 100% tariff on all of these dumped machines and I saved that company. And then I said to the head of the company it was great actually called me said we don't know what to do you can't I mean they're dumping this stuff they can't be you know they're losing a fortune but it didn't matter because their governments were paying for it you said I don't know what to do it's okay so I solved the one problem they're not dumping what's your next problem they don't allow us to use water we need more water you can't wash dishes unless you have a certain amount of water I said how much do you need we need just a little bit more I said I'll give you a lot more I gave my lot more now that I'm going to give you a lot more. Now they want to end it again you ever go into a new home where you have a shower where the water doesn't come out of the shower head they put a restrictor on I took all the restrictors off I took them off. I've had the experience I take a shower I want that beautiful head of hair to be nice and wet. Lather I wanted to be lathered beautifully and I get this best stuff you can buy and I jump it all over and I'm and then I turn on the water and the damn water drips out take speak I can't get this stuff out of my hair it's a horrible thing. Now it's terrible you turn on the sink and the faucet you turn it in and no water practically no water come so you leave your hands under there you're trying to get the water well I revoked all of that stuff and they just put it back on isn't it terrible and these are areas that have a lot of water where they don't know what to do with it it goes out to see and we'll turn it back on on the first day we're going to do a lot of things on the first day we're going to take care of a lot of problems. First day in office we're going to close up the border first day in office we're going to drill baby drill. Thank you very much. Think of it we built hundreds of miles of wall it was so great Mexico is not thrilled I went to Mexico I said you got to take back the people you sent in they said no no I said in fact you have to do more than that you sent so many people you have to give us 28,000 soldiers they said no why would we do that the president who I liked actually is a socialist but we got along very well I got along good with all of that. But that didn't mean they loved my policy my policy was brutal I mean think of it China never paid us ten cents I told you now they paid us hundreds of billions you think and I like presidency but you think he really likes me too much. In fact Biden's having a hard time taking off the tariffs because it's so much money coming it isn't know what to do but he'll do what is coming to tell him to do. But think of it so Mexico said no no we're not going to give you 28,000 I said yes you will 100% they said we're not going to give you why would we do that they left at me they thought what what kind of a person is this is what has for such a stupid request I said no you're going to give it 100% and I had it out a little bit with the president I said listen you and I have friends just send me a negotiator please. And they sent the man and you've heard this I told it a couple of times a handsome man from Mexico tall dark and handsome. He was wearing the most beautiful suit I've ever seen and I wanted to ask him who is your tailor but I said that's not a good way to start a negotiation. So I figured I wouldn't do that I'd skip on his tailor but I said listen we want to give and I said to the secretary of state and I said the people that work in the State Department give me a best of list 10 best of I want your best up the 10 things that you want and they wrote 10 things down and a woman from the State Department of very nice woman but allows you negotiator she said sir we've been asking for these things for 25 years you'll never get them I said 100%. She said you won't sir I said just sit back and watch so this gentleman came in with a beautiful suit handsome guy and I said I want 28,000 soldiers I want to think called remain in Mexico meaning everybody has to remain in Mexico they can't come into our country until they've added and checked which was very few people came in. We had the best border in history now we have the worst border in the history of the world but I said I want 28,000 I want remain in Mexico nobody comes in until they have added and checked I want catch and release you know catching releases we catch and release and then we release the people into our country we say come back in five years for a court case but nobody ever comes back except for the really stupid ones nobody ever comes back. And seven other things that were worse and I put the list before him and he left at me he left at me like I was a fool he left at me. I said do you think I'm a fool no sir but these are foolish things you're asking for you said you're going to do it no I'm not I said you're going to do it 100% you're sitting there right you're going to do it and now we start to get a little bit strange because he say why is this guy have such confidence in this and I said you're going to do it he goes no way and I said way. Then I told him I told him I said here's what's happening if you don't do it I have before me a document right here it's right here and I said you don't do it I'm signing this document this was a Friday afternoon I said on Monday morning at seven o'clock we're putting on 25% tariffs on everything that comes in from Mexico including all the cards and I said I'm going to do it. Including all the cars that you stole from America all those newly manufactured Mexican cars that come in by the tens of thousands and then you have one month and it goes to 50% that it goes to 75 then it goes to 100 and I think I'll stop at 100 and that's many times more than the cost of 28,000 soldiers and he said sure. He couldn't breathe I said are you okay in that beautiful suit he was getting his suit was getting very damp I said are you okay he goes oh and by the way I have to I had a great word that I was going to use but it's a curse word and I was told by a great evangelical preacher just this week sir you tell the greatest stories you're the greatest everything but sir please don't use that. I said sometimes you need foul language to tell a great story because there's no words like this he said sir you don't so I was going to use a really terrible word but it's over in an instant but the truth is I think it does look worse look at all the media back there I think it does look worse on television than it sounds and so did you notice I had a blank space right there I said I said here's what you do you go and tell me I'm not going to do it. He said sir may I take five minutes I'd like to make a phone call back to Mexico I said absolutely say hello to the president please that's who you're calling right yes sir how did you know I said please be quick because I have a very important appointment coming in so he went out came back very quickly. Sir it would be my great honor to supply you with 28,000 soldiers free of charge it would be my great honor to create a new policy of stay in Mexico or remain in Mexico and sir it would be my great honor to have catch and release in Mexico as opposed to catch and release into the United States. And I said the things that we would like very much to do that also by the way the woman from the state department she almost had like a heart attack she couldn't believe it and she was a good woman she was actually happy a lot of them would be unhappy because you know they would have been right about the point she was actually happy she couldn't believe it. I did many many things like that I did it with McCrone you saw McCrone taking advantage of Biden just the last couple of days he's looking at him like how dumb is this guy what the hell is that landing in a parachute and he turns the right. He's not the only one who has a very good background not to watch the guy landing but to watch a tree behind them and the new and very respected leader of Italy I didn't know who that was the woman came up to him and turned him spun him around like he was a top. He had no idea where the hell he was he's watching a parachute land and he turns around to look at trees. And I don't like to imitate anymore because the fake news is always putting it on my wife I told the story yesterday I imitate him he can never find the stairways of the stair or for stage it we got him all over the place there over here I have emergencies right there you can't even see him but I have stairs all over it's almost impossible not to find the stair you can walk in any direction. And I am a Tade him I am a Tade him getting lost and you ever notice you always goes like this you make the speech at last her about a minute and a half. People come to listen to him you know how many people come like we have this massive room that's packed to the corners and outside you got more people listen. He can't fill up the eight circles and I said by the way the eight circles were meant for COVID they meant for COVID you don't have to use them but they use them as an excuse because nobody comes so he's up and he's before a tiny little crowd 30 40 50 people and the speech lasts for like a minute and then he's looking for the exit and he goes like this. He always does it he points and he's pointing in the right direction and then he walks in a different direction. And I said to our great first lady I called her and we had a big crowd that evening you know what we had 107,000 people in New Jersey two weeks ago. 107,000 people Matt gates was there Matt gates was there. We had 68,000 in Alabama 70 73,000 in Texas we have the biggest crowds in the history of politics that tells you they like what we're saying. I called our first lady and said how good was that speech was that brilliant was that but did you see the crowd first lady this is the way you talk to a wife right I think did you see the crowd first lady how good was that nobody else could get a crowd in history of politics nobody ever had a crowd like that first lady. She goes but your hair looked terrible. So what the hell or she'll say something even worse have you gained weight you didn't look good. But this last time it was like a fluke she said the speech was unbelievable congratulations but what happened you couldn't find the stairs going off the stage. So I imitated him and the fake dude said I couldn't find the stairs. I said no problem first lady she said well they showed you you couldn't get off the stage you were walking into a wall you know usually there's a wall be hot. That's good enough and I'll walk into it now I don't like to do it anymore because they show it to no that's an imitation of Biden but thank God we have great secret service they run up on the stage and they grab them and they go. They get them off the stage. Upon my inauguration we will throw out by dynamics and replace it with magnomics. And in less than four years Crooket shows inflation nightmare and energy price likes the likes of which we've never seen before they've caused the typical American household 28 thousand dollars the monthly cost of a typical mortgage has doubled and tripled even we added at two dollars. Think of this we're at 2.3% and he's at probably 10% but you can't get money the numbers are crazy the food numbers the energy numbers yet Joe Biden has no plan he's got absolutely no plan. He doesn't even know what the word inflation means I don't think if you gave him a quiz I think he should take a cognitive test like I did I took a cognitive test and I asked Doc Ronnie. Doc Ronnie Johnson was everyone know Ronnie Johnson congressman from Texas he was the White House doctor and he said I was the healthiest president he feels in history so I liked him very much immediately. In fact he said if I didn't eat junk food I would live to 200 that's what he said. But I said Ronnie should I take a test he said well you know it's Walter Reed it's sort of a public hospital if you don't do well they're going to find out about it I said well you know like I'm a smart person how tough is it he said he gets very tough as you get to the middle of it and I did something that he's never seen done I hasted I got every question right I hasted. I hasted. In front of a lot of people and I think presidents you run for president now I understand I understand that it's not constitutional it's can you believe it's unconstitutional to have that test taken so we have to live with guys like Biden but you know what I don't think we're going to live with them for long because I've never seen such enthusiasm I've never seen anything we won we won twice. And we never had anything like what's happening now. But I'll stop Joe Biden's inflation causing spending spray and impose an immediate moratorium on all of crooked Joe's hundreds of billions of dollars and waste he's wasting money at levels never seen before he's putting all this money into the green news scam it's a scam one of the greatest scams in history. Although I give Zelensky I think Zelensky is maybe the greatest salesman of any politician that's ever lived every time he comes to our country he walks away with $60 billion and I like him you know on the impeachment hoax number one he was very good he said no the president didn't threaten me at all he could have been a grandstander and said I was threatened right Matt he could have said I was threatened right now. He could have said I was threatened so I like him but he's the greatest salesman of all time he walks in so now he is the beauty he just left four days ago was $60 billion and he gets home and he announces that he needs another $60 billion else it never ends it never ends I will have that settled prior to taking the White House as president elect I will have that. I have that. I have that. What it never happens to fight Joe Biden's inflation I will stop the Biden migrant this is a Biden migrant invasion and estimated 50% of inflation has been caused by the soaring cost of housing which is skyrocketing due to Joe Biden's tidal wave of illegal immigration and high interest rates and they're putting these illegal aliens into luxury. In to luxury hotels as our great warriors lie on the streets we have people that came into our country illegally at their living in hotels and even luxury hotels and our veterans are lying in the streets how sick is it sick. By the way when we ran the VA we had a 92% approval rating and we took it up from 41% which I don't even think was 41 and now it's back to where it was so many of the things we did they wanted to end we took care of our veterans at a level that nobody has ever seen before one thing we said if you have to wait online and I had to get this done through Congress if you had a wait online for more than one day you go out to a private doctor get you started. We have a doctor get yourself better we pay the bill right that sounds sensible people are waiting for three months for four months for two weeks can you imagine you want to see a doctor you really feel badly and he says good come back in about a month and a half people were becoming terminally ill that would have had a minor they would have gotten a shot or they would have taken a pill they were becoming terminally ill anybody waits more than 24 hours you couldn't see a doctor you go to a private doctor and we pay the bill we had prices we had schedules the other thing we did is we had civil service nine thousand people that were crooks and thugs and satis a lot of satis they enjoyed beating up our wounded warriors in less than prime time you know in prime time they would have gotten the hell beat out of them but our people were in bad shape and they would beat them up we had satis can you believe this is a country but it's the way it is 9000 I got the approval we fired 9000 people and replaced them with good loving people and we had the highest approval rating in the history of the VA but what makes you sick is to see what's happened with our soldiers and you see the way others are being treated how about they given a cell phone they're given all sorts of insurance they're given hospitalization and what it does is that people want to come into the country Gavin Newscom the governor of Gavin the great Gavin Newscom now Gavin Newscom said come come into the United States we will provide you with hospitalization we will provide you with education they're actually taking the chairs of our students sitting there with a language that we've never even heard about you know there are languages that we have nobody in our country that can even speak there are lot of languages out there now he's destroyed California if you listen to him on Sean Hannity I listen to him and he talks like California the people are leaving California I hate to say that because I have property in California maybe I'm hurting the value of my property but I have to tell you he's destroying California and he may be the next one up he could be the next one up I don't think so though because his record is so bad but something's happening I do believe because I can't believe that this gentleman is going to be allowed to run for office and if he is we have to have the greatest victory we're going to take back our country we're not going to let this happen to our country we're not going to let it happen think of this a week ago I woke up and I heard that Russia has nuclear powered submarines in Cuba that 60 miles off the coast of Florida and they have what you call destroyers very destructive ships actually missile carrying ships numerous of them in Cuba now that's a total lack of respect and because the fake news is so fake they don't want to report it because when you think about how bad that is Putin would never have done that with me he never would have gone into Ukraine with me he just wouldn't have done it and of course when the oil price hit almost $100 a barrel that gave him the right to do it also he's the only one made money prosecuting a war but all of those things would have happened you would have never had October 7th in Israel you would have never had that there was no attack because Iran was broke when Trump was president Iran was broke I told China you can't buy I told other countries you can't buy the oil Iran was broke they were ready to make a deal we would have made a deal we would have been very fair we would have made a deal and now Iran is rich as hell they have $250 billion which they made over the last three and a half years ago there are rich countries now it's unbelievable they could have made a deal we could have had a deal if that election wasn't rigged and stolen we would have had a deal with Iran the first week after the election instead we have a very hostile country that wants nuclear weapons to get let that happen we just gave $6 billion to Iran for five hostages you saw that $6 billion and once you do that then all of a sudden lots of other people are going to go missing because it's crazy think of it $6 billion for five people it's unbelievable we will make the Trump tax cuts permanent and cut taxes even more for working families and small businesses you know it's interesting we cut taxes the biggest tax cuts in history bigger than Reagan because Reagan had big tax cuts we had bigger that bigger than Reagan so the rates were cut way down for business down to 21% from I mean including state and city and everything many many companies are paying much more than 50 so they were cut way down 21% in fact I'd like to bring them down further and for the middle slash bring them down even more they're going to let them expire they're going to give you the biggest tax increase you've ever had ever by four times but the amazing thing is we cut the rates way down and we took in more money than we ever took out before so with a lower rate the incentive was so great people were doing things businesses with thriving so with a much lower rate we took in more revenue than we ever took in before it's an amazing number right who would think as part of those tax cuts I have announced that I will eliminate taxes on tips for restaurant workers and hospitality workers and anyone else be lying on tips no more taxes on tips no taxes on tips none none in fact on your receipt when you get your receipt for a restaurant you know who sent me one kid rock how good is kid rock isn't it great Zika but he sent me a receipt and he wrote on the receipt vote for Trump and you won't pay taxes on tips he wrote that on the receipt is that that's very smart smart guy so for restaurant workers for hotel workers for tatties for car people it's a lot but anybody receiving tips is no more tax on tips and I think that's going to be a great thing you know they earned it a lot of people don't get tips you don't like the service you don't give them anything right you don't like the service but somebody does a good job they're supposed to pay tax on it no so we're ending that immediately effective immediately where we get in as we rescue our economy will also seal the border and send Joe Biden's illegal aliens back home we have no choice it's not sustainable by anybody we have no choice less than four years ago I handed crooked Joe Biden the strongest most secure border in US history we built 571 miles of border wall we ended all catch and release we shut down asylum fraud like nobody's ever thought even imaginable we had remained in Mexico safe third agreements and title 42 all done and all agreed by Mexico you think that was easy it wasn't easy it was nasty actually now we paid nothing for it nothing just like we gave Macron nothing I was going to say he was going to put a 25% tax on everything anybody doing business in France I said you can't do it he said oh do not do not we would love to do this it was passed by our legislature now parliament or whatever the hell he calls it and I said no no so I gave it to minutia and some people I said go deal with France hell them they're not going to do it and they came back they couldn't make the deal and then they came back again I said you have one more day make the deal they couldn't make the deal I called up Macron I said Emmanuel how are you how are you Emmanuel you saw the way he was toying with Biden two days ago he was toying with Biden got Biden to sign things I can't even believe it what they're signing away but he was toying with him and I said to him listen Emmanuel if you don't drop that tax immediately no no I cannot do that I said yes you can if you don't tax it immediately all wine every bit of wine every bottle of wine and champagne that you send into the United States we're putting a 100% tariff on that wine or champagne we don't want you wine and champagne we make great stuff over here and he said do not do not know that is not fair I said yeah it's not fair to charge American companies 25% I got to stick up for the company there are job producing he said that is not fair I said Emmanuel you have 24 hours to tell me 10 minutes would be better recalls me up five minutes later Donald we have agreed to terminate the 25% tax on America this is I do things like this you have no idea how many deals you could make on a phone I don't even have to spend how about Mrs. Biden and Jill Biden back and forth like it's a taxi cab from Europe they come back let's go to the trial for a day back back forth back forth on Air Force one like it's a taxi cab it's not a taxi cab it's serious stuff but that's endemic of where they come with the country and how they run the country they don't know what the hell they're doing they really don't know what the hell they're doing the entire world is emptying out their prisons and jails they're insane to silence their mental institution and our countries being turned into a dumping ground and the entire world is laughing at us they say how stupid are the leaders of America and they are stupid earlier this week I arrested not one not two but eight suspected terrorists get poor again at levels that nobody's ever seen before and we're going to pay a big price we got to get them out fast one of the first things I'm doing we're getting them out fast according to reports many of these terrorist savages entered through Joe Biden's open border and Crookageau released them immediately into the United States he set them loose the spread their terror network all across America under Biden there has been a if this is by the way border patrol this isn't me somebody would say oh that's Trump this is border patrol there has been a 3000 percent increase in the number of people in the terror watch list crossing the southern border 3000 percent 3000 percent that's choice for every voter this November is clear you can have a president who lets thousands of radical Islamic terrorists into our country or you can have a president who throws radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country and gets them out fast right raising one day one of my new administration we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history we have no choice this is not sustainable and it doesn't make me happy to say that either and you know what's going to happen we'll get 10 terrorists and then one woman with two children that a beautiful children and that'll be the front page of every newspaper it's never an easy thing to do but we have no choice Dwight Eisenhower which people don't think of him in these terms had the largest deportation effort by far in the history of our country because he said they're destroying our country we can't let this happen that was Dwight Dwight the Eisenhower president much stronger president that people give him credit for but we're going to have no question we're going to have no problem you know they wouldn't take as you know with we have MS 13 the worst killers of any gang anywhere in the world and they were pouring into our country and I said we want to get them out I said I want to bring them back to their country because you don't want to put them in our jails it's so expensive and everything they killed two girls in long Island they sliced them up with a knife they didn't want to use a gun they didn't want to use a gun they sliced them up with a knife two young high school girls walking to school they killed them sliced them into pieces with a knife their animals and Nancy Pelosi said you shouldn't call them animals these are human beings I said no they're not human beings these are animals they sliced them up with a knife and by the way ice and border patrol you know ice came in this was in Long Island ice for some reason they like Long Island but ice came in and these are great patriots these are tough cookies I know some of my friends up here in the front rows they're tough but they're not doing the ice they're not doing that and you'll see ice come in and they'll run into what they call a pack a pack of MS 13 tough guys and you'll see for two minutes fists of flying and everything's flying who the hell wants to do that Matt Gates wouldn't do it Byron wouldn't do it Byron stuff he wouldn't do it I wouldn't do it I think Mike Lindell might do it I don't know he may be the only one he may be the only one I wouldn't do it Mike and they go in there the hands of flying and then they grab them they're got got their all knocked out and they put them in patty wagons but my people told me that we couldn't get them back into their country so Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they come from countries just beyond Mexico some come from Mexico actually but the countries won't take them back they clogged it up the runway so that a plane can't land they blocked all the roads so the buses couldn't get in and the generals came to be sure we have a problem we have them all but we can't get them back in we haven't been able to get them back in for many many years during the Obama administration they could never get them in that was Obama Biden Biden didn't have a clue then either by the way we cannot get them in sir I said really how much money do we pay them a year for their economic development stuff so I was going to use another word there but I can't do it because of the man that I respect so much you know who it is Franklin Graham I can say that who's the great guy you wrote me in a president you don't have to use foul language you just don't have to use foul language your stories are so great your crowds of the biggest crowds ever assembled nobody's ever done this you don't need foul language I said sometimes you do for emphasis he said you don't sir so I'm trying it without foul language today for Franklin Graham and I say that these stories lose 10.2 percent effectiveness but I do it for Franklin Graham because he's a great guy and those are great people they're great people what they do the pastors the preachers the rabbis a lot of great people we have a lot of great people so I'm doing that I said you know maybe he's right but think of it so they bring these people out and they can't get them back into their country so I said pull the presidents of those three countries inform them immediately they get $750 million from the stupid United States inform them that we're not paying them any longer because they didn't fulfill all of the obligations under the agreement namely they're sending a lot of you know they send them because they don't want them in their country because they're smart and you know what it was me running those countries I would have done it faster than them why wouldn't you do it I would have cleaned out the prisons they've only gone down 50 60 70 percent Venezuela prime is down 72 percent because they've taken all of their criminals most of them and they've sent them in to have the rest of them in within a year I would have done it much faster if I were them I would have done it much faster I said tell these countries that we're no longer paying them $750 million and they did and the next morning I get to the office early 730 I get three calls separately but simultaneously Mr. President may we speak to you I would like to speak to you I don't understand there must be some miscommunication you stop payment on all of the money you send us but I ask why because you're not taking your criminals that you send to us they send them by the way they send them you're not taking them back oh sir we would be delighted to take them back it would be our great honor to take back 400 MS 13 savages it would be our great honor sir please send them back we would love to take we can fly them in will set the Arab uh yeah yeah for years they weren't able to do it you know that med gates they weren't able to get it I said we're not going to pay them anymore as soon as I said that they all called at the same time I spoke to them separately it was like the same conversation we would be delighted to take them back and that was the end of that we sent out thousands and thousands of MS 13 back to their country but it's at a control now because whatever we sent back they're coming back in at levels that nobody's ever seen I won in 2016 because of the border we had a really bad border but that border was nothing compared to what you have now that border was peanuts it was nothing it's no wonder Joe Biden and his thugs are so desperate to stop us they know that we are the only ones who can stop them and they know it and it was just announced that they withdrew their lawsuit the laptop from hell lawsuit right the fake remember where they said it was Russian disinformation it wasn't they withdrew their lawsuit against the greatest mayor in the history of New York City Rudy Giuliani which accused him of everything under the sun regarding the laptop from hell they withdrew it on the basis that everything that he said was true for years he's been fighting for himself everything Rudy Giuliani said was true it was not from Russia it had nothing to do with Russia it only had to do with Hunter think of that they try and destroy people but think of that it wasn't Russian disinformation it was made up story for election interference purposes and I assume we're going to be talking about at the debate is anybody going to be watching the debate in this room you know they gave me an offer that I couldn't accept they said it's fake taper is the border innorator they said they said it's a sit down it's a very sterile room nobody in nobody allowed in nobody allowed not even your family nobody allowed in there'll be no audience whatsoever and they turn off your mics when you finish speaking they're trying to make this very exciting right they turn off your mics so that you can't talk while the other man is talking but maybe that's a good thing maybe that's possible let him talk but so they assume that I would say no because you know you got CNN fake news which their cameras just went off look their cameras the light just went off to see it then their light just went off I watch their light all the time if I mention anything about voter fraud they turn their light off because they know it's true it's unbelievable no their light just went off I can't believe I got about a minute and a half that cameraman is toast he's going to be fired immediately but they gave me it's like the mob they gave me an offer I couldn't accept I said I accept because we want to get them to debate because here's what happened they made an offer they were so ridiculous and they knew I was going to say no and then they could go they say Biden wanted to debate but Trump refused to debate right but Trump refused to debate he wouldn't do it but I said yes and now they don't know what the hell to do but remember this all of their persecution of me and others is only happening because I'm running for president and leading very big in the polls and since the rig trial in New York my numbers have increased substantially and fundraising by the way is I believe the highest numbers in the history of politics just like these crowds because you know what the people of our country know they know it they watch it they see its fake it's rigged there was no crime the greatest legal minds in the country Alan Dershowitz, Andy McCarthy, Greg Jarrett all of them great these are great legal minds all of them every single one of them Greg Jarrett wrote the most beautiful report every single one of these legal minds I have 15 of them not one of them Jonathan Terley has been unbelievable great very talented guy the great one you know who the great one is Mark Levine Mark Levine Mark Levine came out he said this is the most horrible thing they all come out said there's no crime there's no trial this trust shouldn't be had etc etc and then I couldn't defend myself because I got a gag order this is the first time in history a president a former president and now the guy that beat all the Republicans in a record fashion faster than anybody has ever done it and now the candidate Republican candidate big deal Republican candidate that speaks stuff a president of the United States has the gag order where I'm not allowed to speak because the judge doesn't want the truth to come out and he knows I'm the one that when I talk they listen people have listened and that's why the polls went higher I'm the only one in history who got indicted and my numbers went up I'm the only one in history who got impeached and my numbers went up it's never been another candidate in history when you get indicted or you get impeached the following events take place you call for a microphone immediately please set up a microphone could you do it like quickly yes you then get to the microphone you guys ladies and gentlemen it's been a great honor to serve you but I will be leaving office right I have to be careful because they'll they'll put this on as though I'm saying it so I have to interspersive with statements like this is just sarcasm but they get up to a microphone this day I'll be leaving office now I will fight for my name in reputation and I will bond and get closer to my family and you never hear from the poor guy again that's the end of him right Mike that's the end of the I've seen it about 200 times I'm the only one that told the truth I'm the only one that explained it and I didn't have to because the people knew it and they know me so well they know me so well they get it I got indicted more than the legendary Alphonse Capone has anyone heard of Alphonse Capone Scarface he was so mean that if he had dinner with a person and if he didn't like him he would kill the person they would never find him again like Mike Lindell he wouldn't like Mike because you know why he'd say those ads they are driving me crazy let's get rid of this guy he couldn't stand those ads Al Capone would take Mike out in two minutes Mike's beautiful new wife would say what the hell happened to my husband you'd never be fat he'd be buried under the World Trade Center but think of it Alphonse Capone Scarface he was the meanest of them all he had a scar that went from here to here Scarface the meanest of toughest I got indicted more than he did and I didn't do anything wrong I didn't do anything wrong even these these great scholars Jonathan Turley said there is no crime and they McArthur said there is no crime there's no crime there was no crime it's a rigged deal we have a rigged country we have rigged elections we have open borders think of it and the court system now is under siege the tundra siege we have a lot of problems in this country on top of that we could end up in World War III because we have an incompetent leader that should never have been there he's an incompetent man as if today we're leading Biden nationally and in every single battle ground state including the wonderful state of Michigan have you heard of Michigan did you ever hear did you ever hear Biden get up and give the wrong state this happened if I if that ever happened to me it would be the end of my political career I always be very careful like I the wonderful state of Michigan supposedly worked so he's in Florida and he goes it's great to be with the people of Iowa Iowa the palm trees the palm trees are all over I was not known for I mean he got Idaho and Iowa mixed up and that you can sort of understand of course potatoes are different than corn but that Idaho it's great to be in Idaho no sir year in Iowa you got new hampshire mixed up with Massachusetts but maybe you can understand he thought he was a you know the he was thought he was across the line but can you imagine if I did that so when I say it's great to be in the wonderful state of and I always think I say I'm about to get this sucker right I'm thinking about it long before I make this statement I'm thinking about we sure this is Michigan you're sure now the fake news will report tonight Donald Trump wasn't sure that he was in Michigan and only the people in this room will understand how dishonest they are the radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we're not going to allow to rig the presidential election in 2024 I will tell you 2016 was was that the coolest evening maybe in history maybe the only thing that's going to blow it away will be November 5th if we win on November 5th I think it'll be the greatest political event in history I actually think of victory on November 5th which actually starts much earlier remember Pennsylvania September 22nd North Carolina September 6th they start earlier you know it's sad when you have to go months early it's crazy what are they doing with all these votes what are they doing but Michael Watley's doing a fantastic job along with Lara doing a fantastic job at the RNC I said we don't need votes and Charlie Kirk is helping he's got his army of young people these are young patriots these are young patriots they don't want to see happen what's been happening in our country thank you Charlie thank you Charlie and I said to Charlie and I said to Michael I said to every listen we don't need votes we got more votes than anybody's ever had we need to watch the vote we need to guard the vote we need to stop the steal we don't need votes we have to stop focus don't worry about votes we got all the votes I was in Florida yesterday every house has a Trump son Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump we have to we have to guard the vote when that vote comes in from the moment they say they're going to sign you know these mail-in ballots are treacherous they're treacherous these these boxes these lock boxes are horrible horrible and we'll change it but we have to win the election in order to change it what they're doing they have these boxes all over the place people are walking up who the hell knows what they're doing it's a horrible thing to watch it's a horrible thing to watch you know when you have a real election and you walk in and they look at you and they check your photograph and they do that you can't do much but we have like in the state of California they send out 38 million ballots who the hell knows where they're going they do they go to a lot of Democrat neighborhoods and you're told you can't win I go to California we have a hundred thousand people show up I said why are we losing California we don't look why would we lose it it's so corrupt the whole election process and what we want to do is we ultimately want to go to paper ballots voter ID one day voting and we want to make sure you're a citizen of this country every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists communist and fascists indict me I consider a great badge of honor because I'm being indicted for you thank you very much never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom because quite simply I will never let them take away your freedom and I won't they want to silence me because I will never let them silence you and in the end they're not after me they're after you I'm just standing in their way and I always will from the very first day that we we it's we not me it's we that we take back the White House from Crookit Joe Biden I believe we're going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country before I even arrive at the Oval Office shortly after we win the presidency I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled we're going to get it settled and stop the death under my leadership we had no new wars Hillary Clinton she used to say look at him look at him listen to him he's going to start wars no no I stopped wars we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate we brought our troops back home I had no new wars I had no wars I started no wars first time in 78 years instead of a globalist war monger and that's what you have in the White House you finally had a peacemaker at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue these terrible wars these horrible wars that were started they never end we call them the endless battles Biden's weakness and failure are putting us in grave danger as president I will restore peace through strength and my next term we will build a great iron dome over our country like Israel has a dome like has never been seen before a state of the art missile defense shield that will be entirely built in America and create jobs jobs jobs it will be the greatest dome anywhere in the world Israel has a dome why shouldn't we have a dome we're going to have the greatest and most sophisticated and by the way Ronald Reagan wanted a dome he was right but the technology wasn't anywhere near that you could never have done it then today we have technology look at Israel the other day 300 missile shot and everyone but one was knocked out of the air 300 to further secure America's future and create opportunity for young people I will end Joe Biden's war on crypto and we will ensure that the future of crypto and Bitcoin will be made in America if we don't do it China will if we don't do it other countries will I will always protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors and you know your social security and Medicare are under siege because of the people coming over the border and the people coming over the border all those billions of people they're inflicting tremendous harm to our black population and to our Hispanic population those people are suffering because their jobs are being taken their hospitals are being taken their schools are being taken they're the ones itself are most you know who else suffers unions no unions going to be able to be sustained like this we will end the weaponization of our government we will bring back law in order to our country we'll take care of our police officers and our great law enforcement Joe Biden is out the other day trying to claim that crime is down but actually crime is way up they don't report crime properly anymore as you probably have heard crooked Joe is citing statistics that no longer include data from 30 percent of the country including the biggest and most violent cities oh I see that's nice meanwhile Joe Biden still supports no cash bail and sanctuary cities I'm probably the only one that has to pay bail think of it I'm the only one I think he's responsible for the deaths of countless African Americans from crime and he also devastated black families in 1994 with the crime bill super predators remember that Joe Biden came up with that super predators the black people have to remember when they go to vote that was 1994 crime bill super predators Joe Biden when I'm president we will end sanctuary cities we will once again support our police we will be going and rebuilding our cities into beacons of hope safety and beauty better than they ever have been before we will take over our horribly run capital didn't Washington DC we will clean it up renovate it rebuild our capital city that no longer will we allow it to be a nightmare of murder and crime it's a nightmare of murder and crime in our capital you leave Michigan you want to go see the Washington monument the Jefferson Memorial you want to see something in Washington you end up getting killed you end up getting shot beat to a pulp but our capital will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world and it will be safe from crime we owe that to our country and we will replace the people that are running our capital who are running it into the ground who by the way were offered 10,000 soldiers or national guard on January 6 along with Nancy Pelosi oh did you see Nancy Pelosi her daughter how her daughters in trouble her daughter is a semi-professional photo journalist so she calls herself and she has Nancy on tape saying it was Nancy's responsibility to secure the capital I hope the congressmen and women remember that little tape that was released two days ago because the fake news doesn't want to talk about it very much she took full responsibility for it she's angry as hell at her daughter she may cut her daughter from over the millions and millions of dollars that she's scammed that she's scammed as a congressperson think of it she has better returns her money than the smartest people in the history of Wall Street look at that I wonder how she did that on day one I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory trends gender insanity and other inappropriate racial sexual or political content onto the lives of our children and I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate and I will keep men out of women's sports and I will fully uphold our great second amendment and our ray endorse me gave me their full endorsement thank you to the NRA we will protect innocent life and we will we will restore a thing called free speech is being taken away from us by these radical thoughts and I will secure our elections at a level never seen before and as I said our goal will be one day voting paper ballots proof of citizenship and voter idea but we have to win the publicans have to win we want a landslide that is too big to rig remember that too big to rig how do you win it there's a point at which they can't cheat we want a landslide that is too big to rig you know we're leading in places that we've never led for 40 50 years Minnesota we're leading by two we're leading in Virginia we're leading in a lot of states that were were not states that people even think about no we want a landslide remember the term too big to rig if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States and added them up they would not have done near the destruction to our country is Joe Biden and the Biden administration have done take the 10 worst and him up he's worse than the 10 worst put together the only good thing is Jimmy Carter is happy because this presidency was brilliant by comparison to Biden so if you want to save America I'm asking everybody to go out and quote swamp the vote USA dot com to make a plan to vote either by mail or early in person or on election day get out and vote and watch your vote if you want to volunteer to help us turn out voters in your neighborhood sign up get trained at Trump 447 dot com you got to watch your vote because they destroy votes they terminate your vote they do all

Michigan petriots who laid the railroads work the factories till the fields forge the steel fought the battles and won the victories that built the motor city and made America into the greatest and
