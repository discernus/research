================================================================================

 Now we... Calm down please calm down you guys put something crazy in the water here in North Carolina Well I have a message in 75 days we are going to take this country back we're going to elect Donald J. Trump and it's going to start right here with the great people of North Carolina. Now I don't know if you all saw but today is the third day of the Democratic National Coronation. Excuse me I said I said coronation I meant convention sorry sorry for the confusion but you know conventions normally are about nominating people who actually win elections and Kamala Harris hasn't won a single vote for the Democratic Party and yet they're gonna make her her nominee. Now I watched her last night in Democrats they think they've cracked the code for how to appeal to normal Americans. Did you watch last night? Are they gonna change their policy? No but now they're distributing camo hats with Kamala Harris's name on him. That's their strategy for appealing to rural voters and veterans is a camo hat with Kamala Harris's name on it. Now you know what I think would appeal to rural voters and veterans Kamala not having a running mate who lies about a service record. Why don't we try that? You see Tim Walt says that he served in a war zone and it turns out the closest he ever got to war is when he left rioters burned down the city of Minneapolis under his watch in the summer 2020. Remember that? Now let's just reflect now we're in day three of the Democratic National Convention. How bizarre it is that they're doing some of the things that they're doing. Normally conventions they celebrate nominees who are elected by the people. Let's remind ourselves how many votes is Kamala Harris won in the Democratic primary? Zero. Zero. That's exactly right. 10 million legal aliens but zero votes. That is the record of Kamala Harris. Now remember the party bosses installed Kamala Harris because they can control her. That's all this is about. Her agenda is not an agenda for the American people. It's an agenda for the people who have gotten rich often a client of this country and we are not going to take it. Are we? Now remember it was her donors. It was Kamala Harris's donors who got rich when we shipped millions of manufacturing jobs off to China and other countries. Americans we got poor. Her donors got rich when America printed trillions of dollars to fund her green scam policies but Americans we paid higher prices for groceries and housing because of it. And now her party wants more power and the way they're going to do it is that she wants to give all those illegal aliens the right to vote. But out here in the state of North Carolina we believe the only people who get to vote in our elections are the people who have a right to be here. Not illegal aliens Kamala Harris. In this November start right here in the Great Stand in North Carolina we're going to send a message to the corrupt leaders of this country. We do not need a president selected by power brokers. We need a president for the people and that's why we're going to send Donald J. Trump back to the White House. There is so much so much at stake in this election. Think of everything that this country has endured over the last four years of Kamala Harris's broken leadership. Prices are up and wages down. Our borders are wide open but we've had a lot of factories closing down. Fentanyl is available on every street corner from North Carolina to Wisconsin but it is impossible for young Americans to find an affordable home to raise their families in. Now Donald J. Trump represents something that so many in this country need right now and I think it's important to recognize that we need hope in the United States of America. Hope that we can reignite this economy and bring back prosperity to American citizens. Hope that we can raise our kids and secure neighborhoods and safe streets. Hope that we can renew the patriotism that binds in the as a country together one nation under God. My friends for a lot of us for a lot of the people that we fight for the American dreams seems out of reach today. The most out of reach has been in a generation but in 75 days we're going to save the dreams of every single American and it will mark the beginning of the future all of us deserve but we're going to do it together. Now we're here to talk about national security today and saving the American dream let's be honest it starts with peace. Peace in our neighborhoods peace in our cities and peace at the southern border. Lord willing we bring back the leadership of Donald J. Trump we're going to have peace all over the entire world you didn't want to before and I think he's going to do it again. Now if if we don't have safety for our families if we don't have security for our country we don't have anything and I'm a firm believer that when we talk about national security national security starts right here at home right here and a great state of North Carolina and there's been no greater area where Kamala Harris has failed to deliver peace and national security than at the American southern border it is a disgrace my friends I cannot believe how bad it is. Now the media will idea and tell you that she was never the borders are. You heard that? Even though they all said she was the borders are for three and a half years and remember that as borders are Kamala Harris has allowed a literal invasion of this country more than 10 million illegal aliens and she's refused to deport the people who are already here. So that makes about 25 25 million illegal aliens that are in this country right now. Now our brave border patrol officers they plead they beg for her support. I was down there at the southern border and I saw it. Giant sections of President Trump's border wall sit right there rusting waiting to be installed but she refuses to do her job and you think it's bad now. If we give Kamala Harris a promotion and make her the president of the United States the southern border is going to look like Walmart on Black Friday ladies and gentlemen still be no good no fun at all. Now while she offers amnesty for the people who've broken our laws we have a different message. President Trump and I have a different message to all the criminal legals who flooded across Kamala's wide open southern border pack your bags because in six months you are going home. Now just weeks ago I actually visited the southern border which means that I've visited the southern border more than our borders are Kamala Harris. I saw where little girls are trafficked by the drug cartels some of the most vile people in the world take an advantage of innocent little children and make money off of them. I met a rancher who endured violent criminals raiding his land just a rancher in Arizona trying to get by and I see the desperation of families torn apart by the fentanyl and all the other poise in the cartels are bringing into our country. Now I know the hurt of that poison very personally a lot of you know my story. I remember being a kid whose mom struggled with addiction. I remember waiting at the bedside of my mom angry that she had taken something that she shouldn't have taken but just praying. Lord Jesus please let her wake up. Let her make it through this time. Now we got to remember my friends because of Kamala Harris's border policies way too many of our loved ones are not waking up. Way too many kids have been orphaned way too many grandparents are raising kids. They didn't expect to raise because Kamala Harris allowed the drug cartels to wage war on this country. I think it's time to wage war on the drug cartels and that's going to start with Donald Trump leadership. Now the president's going to be here in just a few minutes but I almost feel bad for him because this is not the first time that Donald Trump is going to have to clean up somebody else's mess. Now remember in 2016 he took over from Barack Obama who let ISIS spread mayhem all over the world. Then Trump came along and in a couple weeks did what the media said could not be done he wiped him off the face of the earth. And remember when we win this November and it's going to start right here North Carolina I think the cartels are next but do just to them what Donald Trump did to ISIS. Now I will admit it is hard to make sense of Kamala Harris's foreign policy especially when she explains it like a third grader who didn't study for a class presentation. Have you ever seen Kamala talk about the Ukraine Russia war? Sure I would okay I'd recommend you go and see it but wait until November because you're going to lose about 20 IQ points when you watch Kamala Harris talk about Russian Ukraine and we need that over the next few months we need you guys in top forms so don't watch it just yet but she'll say well Ukraine is a country in Europe and Russia is a country in Europe and then you say okay well what comes next Kamala and the answer is nothing comes next because she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. But but if you want to give her the benefit of the doubt and understand her foreign policy remember that she bragged on CNN about playing a key role in the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Now that was before 13 innocent service members died at the Kabul airport. That was about three years ago to the day that was before the world witnessed panic civilians clined to the sides of retreating American airplanes and that was before they gave the Taliban billions of dollars paid for by you billions of dollars of helicopters planes humvees an artillery. It was the worst humiliation this country has endured since the fall of Saigon and Kamala Harris says she's proud of what she did. It was treason and it is at any wonder that Putin then invaded Ukraine on her watch or that Iran attacked Israel on her watch or that this very moment China is ramping up its aggression against Taiwan on her watch when Kamala Harris walks in the room America's enemies since weakness and that's why we have got to fire Kamala Harris not give her promotion. Now she she wants to represent America all over the world but she's terrified to face a friendly media. Does anyone think that the person who runs from the friendly American press could stand up to Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong-un or Xi Jinping? Of course she couldn't. So if you believe that a strong America requires a strong leader I've got a recommendation for you why don't we re-elect President John L.J. Trump. And while we're on the topic don't send her stolen valor sidekick send a former Marine send JD Vance to be Vice President. We got some Marines out there, Simper-Fie. Now Kamala Harris she gets really mad when I bring up the stolen valor of her running mate but let me tell you why it matters every single person here understands why this matters. Here's the record on Tim Walls the governor of Minnesota he dropped out of the military and allowed his unit to go to Iraq without him and he knew they were going to Iraq he lied about it but he knew they were going to Iraq. Even his chaplain called him a coward and those of you served as military know the chaplain is the nicest person in the unit. The chaplain is calling you a coward you must have really screwed up. He claimed to carry a weapon in war but he asked him Tim what war have you ever been in and the answer as he's never been to a single war he lied about it. He lied about his rank and he stood in silence as Nancy Pelosi and a lot of journalists praised him for his service on an imaginary battlefield instead of correcting the record. What fault stolen valor Tim Walls fib about? In fact I believe at his next speech he's probably going to say he survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania I think that's what Tim Walls is going to claim next time. Now look we don't criticize and this is where the media is dishonest. He will criticize Tim Walls for his years of service in the National Guard. We condemn him for lying about that service for political gain. It's disgraceful and nobody should tolerate it. Now Tim Walls needs to not only explain why he abandoned his guard unit he also needs to explain his bizarre love affair with China. Have you seen this? This guy's been to China more than the US ambassador to China. He got married in China. He visited China over 30 times. He honeymooned in China. He taught a course approved by the Communist Party in China. He even brought American high school students with him on visits to China. Now I know and we all know that Kamala Harris wanted to outsource our factories and jobs to China but I didn't expect her to outsource the selection of her running mate to China too. But here's the problem in choosing him for Vice President. It's not just about Tim Walls. It's about Kamala Harris's terrible judgment. We do not need a president with terrible judgment. We need Donald J. Trump back in the White House. Nothing matters in national security and foreign policy more than judgment because nobody knows what's going to happen. Nobody knows what crisis is going to erupt over the next four years. And I got to be honest with you my entire adult life has been shaped by presidents who threw Americans into unwise wars and then failed to win them. And if we're being honest it wasn't just Democrats. It was sometimes Republicans too. And what did Donald Trump do? He stood up to the chicken hawks. He but the foreign policy establishment even sometimes he resisted pressure from within his own party. In President Trump's four years at office we had zero new wars. We had peace all over the world when Donald J. Trump was president. In the Middle East he brokered the Abraham Accords brought stability and created a long term balance to Iran. In Europe he pushed the Europeans to take more responsibility for their own defense so the United States would not have to pay for a bunch of free-loaders. We ought to focus on our own security not subsidized European welfare. They can take care of themselves. And never forget as much as the Democrats said that Donald Trump was somehow on the side of Russia the only president of the last 20 years who didn't who had Russia not invade a neighbor was the presidency of Donald J. Trump. He kicked Russia in check. He's the only president of our lives to do it. Under Kamala Harris Putin invaded Ukraine but under Donald Trump Putin didn't do a damn thing and that's because of strong leadership. People respected him. And that's by the way my friends why we were able to defend our own border is because Donald Trump didn't have us distracted by fighting wars that we had no business being involved in. We got to focus on our own border right here at home. That is the Donald Trump principle and that's what we're going to bring back to the White House. It's funny all these people said that he was going to start a nuclear war but President Trump knew more about diplomacy than any president in the last 40 years. In Asia he opened diplomatic talks with North Korea after a half century of stagnation. And you remember when he went to North Korea he met with Kim Jong-un the leader of that country. And if you know anything about Kim Jong-un well how do I say this politely? Kim Jong-un doesn't miss a whole lot of meals okay my friends that's and Trump stands there with the media in Kim Jong-un. You remember this I'd encourage you to go look it up and he brings the media in and he says all right everybody take some photos of us make us look nice make us look skinny and Kim Jong-un set up like that. It's it means something to have a president who's not afraid to go into hostile territories tell a few jokes and actually engage in diplomacy. That preserves peace while all these Democrats lied about Donald Trump being the candidate of nuclear war Donald Trump is the person who prevented nuclear war and if we're not careful Kamala Harris is going to walk us right into nuclear war we got to kick her out and not give her promotion to President of the United States. And maybe maybe the most important thing Donald Trump did is he began the process of ending America's economic reliance on China. The most important thing because Donald Trump understands economic security is national security. The whole world knows that China doesn't have better workers than America but they're willing to lie sheet and steal to win. They lied about unleashing COVID-19. They cheat and they ignore trade rules and they steal America's intellectual property. Now Kamala Harris let's China get away with all of it and China Tim helps her. Donald Trump is going to let China steal a damn thing. He's not going to let him steal our factories. Not going to let him steal our jobs. Not going to let him steal the American dream from American workers. Donald Trump will not allow America to be dependent on Chinese medicine for our children. That's a big thing. You know so much of what we put into the bodies of our children is made in China. It doesn't make any sense. And Donald Trump will tell China that if they don't stop sending fentanyl into our city there is going to be hell to pay. No more that crap. We need somebody who stands up for American workers. Now the establishment loves to complain about President Trump's approach to diplomacy. They don't like the way that he talks. Have you seen this? Why? Why is it that our leaders are so careful with their words but so reckless with their actions? I prefer a different kind of statesmanship. One that stands up to the crowd. One that stands for American interests and that pursues those interests ruthlessly but also carefully. With strong words and the strongest military in the world but with great restraint to balance it out. Donald Trump's presidency was the first disruption to the failed consensus and the terrible consequences that it brought. So I say let him line about Donald Trump's tweets because let's be honest folks. Mean tweets and world peace has a pretty nice ring to it. I think we ought to bring it right back. We have got a once in a lifetime opportunity to reelect a man who proven he's too big for the deep state bureaucracy. He's too tough for the tyrants all over the world. He was too strong even for an assassin's bullet. Ladies and gentlemen let's return to a time when the bravest man leads this nation with strength. That man is Donald J. Trump. He was the one's president of the United States and we in North Carolina. We're going to make him the future president of the United States. God bless you North Carolina. Thank you. Let's win this race. Let's do it together. God bless you all. Thank you very much everybody. It's great to be here. What a place. Did you like the flyover? That was pretty good. We were going low and fast. That was moving along as pretty low. I just want to thank JD through the fantastic job and I want to thank North Carolina. I love.

I don't know what they have gone. They have something going here, Governor. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Doctor. But America's blessed with the greatest military in the world. I think we did it in three weeks. We have the greatest military in the world, but you need the great leaders. Everywhere I go, soldiers and veterans tell me how angry they are that not one person has been held accountable for the Afghanistan catastrophe. They are not. You know, they are not. They have never fired anybody. I fired people when they didn't do a good job. come back with something and now nobody's ever been in the position where you know they get offered also some money from the fake news and everything else and fame we're gonna make you famous all you have to do is make up some stories about Trump but people don't seem to care it's phony stuff phony horrible they're lightweight still terrible people you know when I came don't forget I didn't know anybody in Washington I'm president of the United States I'm going down Pennsylvania Avenue with our biggest load of military and police and motorcycles and everything you've ever seen and I didn't know anybody I said to my wife I don't know a lot of people but the people I know I got recommendations from a lot of good people well-meaning people some were good most were great but we had some bad ones too but now I know them all in Washington I know the good ones the weak ones guys like this I know the weak ones and the bad ones general we know the we know the dumb ones in this mark one's not way we know them all but the voters will hold Kamala and Joe accountable for this November when I take office and they're going to be held accountable for what they've done to this country right thank you I will ask for the resignations of every single senior military official who touched the Afghanistan disaster I want their resignations immediately and I want them on the desk in the Oval Office the Resolute Desk I want them on at 12 o'clock an auguration day everybody involved with that disaster when you have a disaster so stupid is that that caused us such problem you don't know what that's done to the reputation of our country the Afghanistan disaster this house cleaning will be a signal to the entire world and America military and everybody else they want people to be held accountable for failure and incompetence and it's just not acceptable that something like that could happen these are fighters they fight with broken old obsolete weapons and knives we have F-16s we have F-35s F-32s and we were knocking the hell out of them just knocking the hell out of them it was easy but I said what the hell are we doing this for let's get the hell out of there we were getting out with such strength it was so happy they couldn't believe it and then these people came in and it's it's horrible to even think about what happened and countries all over the world lost respect for us because of Afghanistan we demand success and we demand victory we won victory from our soldiers and from everybody else under comrade comala Harris and I call that because it's never been she's a Marxist okay I was saying do you think she's a Marxist or a communist to people that really study this stuff they weren't able to tell me they said it could be all the way could be communist but she's damn close they said it was definitely won or the other but they couldn't actually tell me was the communist of Marxist sir it's one of the other we're not sure we'll figure it out but under comrade comala our military has been abused for radical social experiments on day one I will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our US armed forces were taking it out our warriors should be focused on defeating America's enemies not figuring out their genders by that time hopefully they know their general Marxist ideologies have no place in combat think of it they go in and they decide if they're going to change my gender now no we we want them to know their gender when they go in you have no idea the disruption that that has caused and the fake news refuses to report it you know when I did a ban I went to a lot of good generals I said I'm not going to tell you names just tell me is it the right thing or the wrong thing the wrong things are it's a wrong thing I had unanimous support and then we did it I didn't do it other people did it I they reversed me as soon as they got in like almost the first day I didn't do it but they allowed things to happen to a military that just not right if you want to have a sex change or a social justice seminar then you can do it somewhere else but you're not going to do it in the army navy coast guard therefore space force or the United States Marines sorry they're not going to do it there the military brass that led these absurd and insulting initiatives will likewise be removed and they will no longer be in command they're going to be gone gone so fast Kamala and Trookajyo per eight thousand service members from our military for refusing their covid vaccine mandate they refused to do it we didn't want a mandate the mandate you can't you just can't do that I will rehire every patriot who was fired from the military with an apology and with back pay they will get their back pay and an apology from our government hopefully they have great jobs right now they're making a lot of money but if they want to come back in they get an apology and we sign them up and they get their back pay should have never happened the mandate stuff should have never happened thanks to Kamarade Kamala and Joe Biden morale in our military is now so low that almost every single branch is suffering a major recruitment and retention crisis you know that upon taking office I will begin the largest peacetime recruitment drive in the history of the armed forces we have to fill our armed forces with great people but they don't have spirit now there's no spirit used to bring other soldiers would bring their friends in now that doesn't happen almost never happens the sense of spirit pride and prestige will soon come roaring back reach levels never seen before we're gonna make it so hot that I'm gonna want to resign and join the military I don't know what rank I would start I guess I started private I don't know what rank would I have to start general I have to start pretty low he said you'll start at the top all right then I'll stay here very good you'll start at the top he knows what this is America's military must always be unrivaled and unbeatable I mean I see reports coming out where they do studies and they said under these circumstances we'll lose a war to China number one if it's true why are we saying it in number two it shouldn't be true should it shouldn't be true not gonna happen why would they release a report like that for China to read we're vulnerable here she said there it is that's a good word who's the woman that said that stand please that's very good not true there she says there it is now they release a report talking about all of the vulnerable areas we need more this we need more that what we care what we think that I don't know who does this report why would you release a report like that so after years that's like saying we have no ammunition the legend gentlemen we have no ammunition at the time with the United States of America you know why we gave it all up to Ukraine and various other places we gave everything empty our warehouses of all of our ammunition let's give it to people free of charge free of charge cost billions free of charge everything's always free of charge so after years of horrific depletion with the comrade sending our missiles and airplanes ammunition to other countries I will make a historic investment in rebuilding the US Armed Forces I did that once before but I have to do it again because they've depleted it just like they've depleted the strategic oil reserves you know we have the strategic in all due respect is not for filling up your car so that you have four cents a gallon less and that you vote for Crook a Joe it's not meant for that it's meant for war it's meant for tragedy it's meant for real stuff it's at the lowest point today in its history we almost have nothing left and we had it at a level that was such a beautiful thing to see we will increase funding but at the same time the days of blank checks for the weapon systems over the past or over I tell you while we will build though we're going to build a great iron dome over our country so that we don't have to get hit we give it to other countries we help Israel in other countries and Ronald Reagan wanted it many years ago as you know but it didn't we didn't really have the technology then he was right but we didn't have the right technology today we have unbelievable technology and you know we have other countries that have it this country should have and we're going to make it right here and we're going to make it in other of our great places but a lot of it's going to come right out of your state it's time to create the arsenal of the 21st century we need that that means aggressively shifting funding to keep America on the cutting edge investing heavily in drones and robotics and artificial intelligence and hypersonics you know hypersonics these are missiles that go seven times faster than a fast ordinary missile seven times faster so fast that for the most part you can't shut them down and you can't shoot them down they go on at levels of speed that nobody thought was possible do you know that was our technology that was stolen by Russia and Russia has them and I started them very quickly but somebody gave Russia years ago before me all of our plans and specs for hypersonic missiles and they built them and we didn't he said built it and it could be might have been in all fairness might have been a little after built then I used to like built them can you believe it it could have been Barack Hussein Obama perhaps we should ask him now he was very nasty listening I try and be nice to people you know but it's a little tough when they get personal please again remember please sir don't get personal talk about policy let me ask you about that we're going to do a free poll here's the two questions should I get personal should I not get personal ready should I get personal should I not get personal I don't know my advisors are fired now we'd rather keep it on policy but sometimes it's hard when you're attacked from all ends I mean they want to put you in jail for nothing for nothing for cases that the legal scholars all over the country have said there is no case and they want to put you in jail and I could have done that to Hillary Clinton and I could have put her in jail she turned away subpoenas and she damaged stuff and she wouldn't give things after a subpoena was sent after from the United States Congress I said to myself we want to bring the country together wouldn't it be terrible to put the wife of the president of the United States and jail wouldn't it be terrible and then I come out and they do it to me and there's no feeling as wouldn't it be terrible but we won the big case in Florida that was totally wrong and Biden didn't you know Biden documents I had the presidential record exact I had the right to do whatever I wanted to do that was passed in like 1978 but Biden didn't have a right to do because he wasn't president and he was there for 50 years he took stuff and the ruling was basically he's guilty as hell but he's got no memory he's a nice man with no memory actually they're wrong he's not a nice man and he has no memory he's not a nice man at all because he started weaponization and weaponization is a double prong that can come back to haunt them too it's a terrible thing for our country I can tell you a terrible thing for our country we need a dramatic increase in research we need a very dramatic increase in development and in so doing we will create countless American jobs including jobs right here in a place called North Carolina do we love North Carolina Laura Trump is from North Carolina she named her daughter Carolina wife of Eric I now say that he's the husband of Laura which he's great he's great and it's a great couple but she loves this place she just loves it she's here all the time and you know she comes and she will ever do she's just said she's amazing she's got a great talent and she along with Michael Watley are running the Republican National Committee and doing a great job you know a lot of times when you do that they'll say oh family let me say this is not a job that somebody this is a tough job and our primary focus is not to get out the vote it's to make sure they don't cheat because we have all the votes you need you can see it every house along the way has signs trump trump trump trump trump dance trump dance and by the way vans is doing a great job vans is doing a great job look at that beautiful red vans now but these signs are all over the place I see it everyone no matter where in Florida they're all over because people want to see common sense you know with a party of common sense it's not conservative liberal they don't want to be called liberal and whether they want to use progressive with progressive progressive I think liberal is more appropriate progressive such a beautiful word right you don't step progressive progressive means go forward they don't go forward they go backward as we rapidly rebuild American deterrence we will quickly restore peace and stability in our country but all over the world will make our country a much safer place we're in grave danger of a war our third world war I tell you before even arrive at the oval office and as I said we're going to do things that are going to be shocking to people but what I'm going to do more than anything else I'm going to get things in line and we're going to prevent that world war three and if you look at what's going on with Ukraine and Russia if you look at on now there's an incursion in to Russia then there'll be another incursion the other within they'll be and then all of a sudden bad things will start to happen they're already starting by contrast if comrade Kamala wins this November world war three is virtually guaranteed to happen everything she touches she destroys everything that she's touched you look at her life she was district attorney and San Francisco the place went to hell it's the best city in the world probably 15 18 years ago 20 years ago maybe in the whole world it was one of the best cities in the world then she becomes the attorney general the state of California that place went to hell it was helped by Gavin Newscombe it was helped newscombe helped but she did she was terrible and it's crime written and it's I mean you can't walk down the sidewalk anymore any it's just unbelievable what's happened to that state so say it best weather beautiful ocean beautiful everything is good but they've they've just let it go to hell and she was and she's going to do the same thing to the United States and when she says I'll let you frack her whole career she said no fracking Pennsylvania in particular no because they get tremendous wealth from fracking they're going to be stopped 100 percent they're going to be stopped she just changed your view a few months ago you got to see you know she ran against Biden there were 22 people running she was the first to leave she quit because she went down like that and she was the first one out she never made it to the first date in the primary she never made it to Iowa never made it to Iowa she didn't get one vote and she still hasn't gotten one vote and she won't have one vote think of it Biden I'm not a fan of Biden I think he was terrible a terrible president what he did to our country he'd look at him with the planes and the stairs and the falling all over the place and he had no idea what the hell was happening he couldn't find his way off the stage a stare here stare there stare I got stairs all over the place he'd finished his speech and look around where am I his speeches lasted the next part it was good in the hot sun because they lasted for about two minutes and he could go home but nobody would come anyway but we can't let her she's much worse much worse than him actually because she's actually more radical he never believed it he just did it for votes I don't know why you get votes by having open borders you know she wants open borders if she became president in four years you'd have 60 to 70 million people from all over the world and it's not just South America and remember they're releasing them from their jails and their prisons they're coming out of jails and prisons and mental institutions and insane assignments then we have hundreds and probably thousands of terrorists that have come into our country we probably have a few here welcome welcome but we probably have a few here and she's all for it and now she's saying and you see what she's saying well the wall was largely built we were adding space onto the wall we built hundreds of miles of wall I actually took it because Congress gave us a hard time and the Democrats who were brutal we had 11 lawsuits and we won all 11 but I took it out of the military I called it an invasion of our country it was an invasion and we built hundreds of miles of wall and then I was going to do 200 extra we ordered it it was there and we had that rotten horrible election that horrible election where we did much better than we did the first time and bad things happened and all of a sudden I hear that they want to have open borders and I thought they were kidding who to hell wants open borders and then they said we'll give you health care you know now they're saying all about how they're getting tough in the borders and how they were tough except they have a couple of problems do you know that we flew in a million people airplanes over the top of the border beautiful airplanes they're flying them in if you want to stop people you're not flying them in on airplanes and many other things no they wanted open borders and we have a country that's loaded up with many many criminals right now of the worst they emptied their jails they emptied their jails and prisons they emptied their mental institutions into our country largely now they're continuing to do it but if you look at many of these countries that we're talking about frankly who can blame them they're dropping their prisoners into the United States of America they're dropping all of these people into the United States including their mental institution people any terrorist they have they're dropping them into the United States we're taking hundreds of thousands of people that were in jail from murder you take a look at Venezuela their jails are half I'm surprised half because frankly I would have worked faster than that if I were running it I would have had all of them out of there by now they go to Caracas they take all their gang members all of their killers their murders their drug dealers they take them and they're putting them into the United States and their crime is down 72 percent in fact next time what we'll do instead of North Carolina we'll have our next little gathering in Venezuela because it will be much safer than being in our country if these people when you're not going to have any meetings you're not going to have anything they'll be chaos in our country and we just can't let it happen we can't let it happen we can't let it happen remember when Biden sent Kamala to Europe to stop the war in Ukraine she met with Putin and then three days later he attacked how did she do she think she did a good job she met with Putin tell him don't do it and three days later he attacked that's when the attack started you know that general should have sent you but over a half a million they say our dead are wounded but it's a much higher number than that and everything lies in ruined look we are going to fight like hell to win this election they are going to cheat like hell to win the election because they have no bounds they have no bounds I've said to some Republicans once in a place called Philadelphia which I love I went to school in Philadelphia but it's suffering tremendously like Chicago like every Democrat run city is suffering but I said like why do we allow them to do it do Republicans do what they do with the stuffing the boxes with all of the different things they do sir we're proud Americans and that's really the right thing to say but they have no bounds we have to win this election if we don't win this election we're in such trouble as a country we're in trouble right now but you have the right guy to straighten it out I'll get it straightened out I'll get it straightened out there we're going to have peace through strength all over the world like we had just a short while ago and I just want to say closing is it's an honor to have served for four years I wish we didn't have this break the only thing good about the break is it shows how bad it can get because we've never had a country that's been in shape like this country is in right now we have squalor in our streets our vets are disregarded living one sidewalks and freezing cold and unbelievably hot cities all over the country and yet we have people coming in to our country that are living in luxury hotels this is what we have we're going to straighten out our country through common sense we're going to straighten out our country with the United States of America with the greatest country in the world we're not going to let this continue to go we're going to straighten it out we're going to make it bigger better stronger than ever before we're going to bring in business we're going to use tariffs to take advantage of our great strength and to frankly hurt countries that are hurting us and have been hurting us on trade for many many years right now China is building massive auto plants in Mexico and they think that those plants are going to make cars and they're going to sell them across the line for no tax no anything destroy what's left and Detroit which frankly compared to years ago is very little at South Carolina and many other places we're not going to let it happen we will charge them 150 or 200 percent tariff and all of that investment that they made is now worthless we're not going to let them do that we're not going to let them destroy our automobile industry the United auto workers has a grossly incompetent man at the head they want to make all electric cars and Elon Musk is a friend of mine you saw he endorsed me very strongly and he understands that I'm right and I love electric cars that have an incredible purpose to have an incredible purpose they're unbelievable what they can do and he makes a great product but I told him I said you know before you're in doers you have to understand we have to have gasoline propelled cars again we have more liquid gold than anybody anywhere in the world more than Saudi Arabia more than Russia we have more than anybody we're going to quadruple that business we're going to be much bigger than both of them put together we're going to pay down debt we're going to reduce your taxes I gave you the largest tax cut in history the largest regulatory cut in history that created all of the jobs and when Biden talks about jobs by the way because they lie so much jobs he created almost all of them almost 100 percent people say more than 100 percent went to illegal aliens the other remember this the numbers sound good because they call bounce back jobs we had a pandemic people were laid off and then as soon and this is common for ages when a pandemic goes you have bounce back the businesses and we had we not done what we did with money probably some of you benefited but we we would have been in a 1929 style depression we did it just right the problem is they came in they no longer needed money we gave them a country that was fixed and more people died during Biden think of that then died during us from covid many more people died during them but think of this we gave them a country and they blew it because they took so much they took trillions and trillions of money they kept feeding it and that's what caused along with their bad energy policies that's what caused this tremendous inflation which is destroying the people of our country and frankly it's contagious it's all over the world but we're the ones that started with their bad policy so we're going to work very hard we've got to win we've got to win this state this state is a very very big state to win we've won it twice and we're going to win it again I said to a couple of the people I said so let me ask you how are we doing compared to four years ago and eight years ago they said sir you're much hotter you're more popular I hope that's true but we won it twice and all I can do is pledge to you that we're going to do a great job for North Carolina we're going to do a great job for the United States of America we put America first and we're going to make America great again thank you all very much thank you thank you very much everybody
