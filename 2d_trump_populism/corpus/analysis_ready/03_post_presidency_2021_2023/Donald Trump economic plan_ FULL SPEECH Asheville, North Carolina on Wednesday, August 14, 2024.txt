================================================================================

 Hello sellers, U-S-C, U-S-C U-S-C United States, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA. And, Bing, hello to North Carolina. Thank you very much. It's great to be back in this beautiful state with the proud, hardworking patriots who make our country run. You really do. You built our country. You make our country run. I want to thank a very good man and he's fighting. He's fighting and we know he's a fighter. The next governor of North Carolina, Mark Robinson. Thanks, Mark. This is Robinson. Thank you. They're a great couple. Thank you both. Thank you very much. Thank you, bro. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That is a very frisky group, I have to say. And, by the way, we have some very good polls coming out today. I just heard, despite all of the fake publicity about this radical left person from San Francisco, how San Francisco doing? Not like North Carolina. Now, we have some very good polls coming out, so that's good. You know, considering the fact that they, what they do, I mean, what they do, what the fake news is able to do, and yet we're leading and let them have their convention. And who knows how that's going to turn out. Joe Biden is a very angry man. You know that, right? Because they took it away from him. They usurped it. They took it away from him. Terrible, terrible. And I'm not sure that they picked the right guy at him, but he got 14 million votes. He got 14 million votes. He got no votes. And you look at what happens. That's not the way it's supposed to happen. They are a threat to democracy, right, as they say. They are a threat to democracy. But thanks as well to members of Congress, Chuck Edwards, and Virginia Fox warriors. Thank you, wherever you may be. Ah, thank you. Thanks, Chuck. Thank you, Virginia. State Order to candidate Dave Balakie said, I'm only in politics for you, sir. I only, where is Dave? Anybody that would say, Dave, if you say that, and if you mean that, I'm for you all the way. He has my endorsement. Thank you, Dave. A man who's doing an incredible job, so good when we won this state, and we won it easily. I said, Michael Watley, you're going to head the RNC with Laura. With Laura. And they're doing an incredible, incredible job. And also your North Carolina GOP chairman, Jason Simmons. Jason. Thank you. Are you doing okay? We're doing good, Jason. Okay. We'll weigh up here. We got to make sure everyone gets out and votes. But we'll weigh up. So I want to thank you. We've had tremendous experience here. We won every time we're in. A special place. Well, my son, you know, he, he and his wonderful wife, you know, who I'm talking about. Laura. Laura. But Eric and Laura, they named their beautiful daughter, Carolina. Okay. I said, which one are you talking about? Well, you know, today I'm going to say it's North Carolina. Now, she was, she was born here, raised here. And I'm sure it's a big reason we've done so well here. She's great. She's really terrific. And he is a great young man. You know, I'm a little prejudiced perhaps because it's your best son, a little bit. But they're a great couple. And thank you very much. We appreciate it. With the help of everyone in this room, 83 days from now, can you imagine 83 days? We're almost there. We got to get it. We're going to defeat super liberal, more liberal than Bernie Sanders. Did you hear that? The most liberal person in the Senate. Can you believe that we're going to defeat Kamala Harris. We're going to win back at the White House at a historic landslide. And we're going to take back our country. We're going to take it back. And I think it's important to say, and I never get corrected. I know it's a fact because, you know, if I'm slightly off, they do storage headlines. He didn't tell quite the truth. Well, we are leading the biggest political movement in the history of our country, bigger than any movement ever before. There's never been a movement like this. Go and make America great again. Make America great again. I say to the Democrats when they come out, well, you know, we've got to try and stop. Maga is make America great again. What do you want to stop it for? That's what we're doing. They put it in a candidate and we beat him badly. How did he do in the debate? Then they put in another candidate. This is like you have two fighters. The one guy's losing. They say, come on out. Let's put in another one. So then they put in another candidate. And we're doing very well, considering the fact that she has the greatest press. She went from being a totally disrespected person six weeks ago. Nobody thought she had a chance. Nobody, and I don't think she can possibly win. If she does, our country is finished. You want to know the truth. But she was totally disrespected. The most unpopular vice president in the history of our country. And then they decided to get politically correct. We have to put her in. They put her in. And now they're putting her on the covers of Time Magazine with an artist sketch. They don't use a picture. They don't use a picture. They use an artist sketch. I want to use that artist. I want to find that artist. I like him very much. But we're going to beat her also. And they may then get a third candidate. Who knows? This is a little bit different than we're supposed to be doing. You're supposed to have a candidate. You know, we spent probably $100 million on beating him. Then we had a very good debate. And we beat him. And they said, well, instead of letting it go, who knows what happens? Right? It's the world of politics. They say, we want him out. Joe, you're getting out now, Joe. Well, I want to get out. I have four team. You're getting out now, Joe. We can do it the nice way. Or we can do it the hard way. And he's getting out. He's getting out. In fact, they're not even giving him a good spot to speak. You know what he's speaking on Monday? Monday is not the worst day. But that's what they do. And it's their own form of, it's just another, I guess, relatively. It's a minor form of cheating by comparison to what they really do. Right? Everything. Kamala Harris touches, turns bad. It all turns bad. San Francisco was a great city. Now it's unlivable. California was a great state. Now it's unlivable. She breaks everything just like she broke the border, broke our economy. But soon we are going to fix every single problem. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have created. And we are going to save our country. We are going to save America. We're going to save America. Now this is a little bit different day because this isn't around. This is what we're talking about. I think called the economy. They wanted to do a speech on the economy. A lot of people are very devastated by what's happened with inflation and all of the other things. So we're doing this as a intellectual speech. We're all intellectuals today. Today we're doing it. And we're doing it right now. And it's very important. They say it's the most important subject. I think crime is right there. I think the border is right there for personally. We have a lot of important subjects because our country has become a third world nation. We literally are a third world nation. We're a banana republic in so many ways. And we're not going to let that happen because we're starting a free fall. But from today and from the day I take the oath of office, we will rapidly drive prices down and make America affordable again. We're going to make it affordable again. Under Kamala Harris and Crook at Joe Biden, the American dream is dead. You don't hear about the American dream anymore. It's dead. Heratical liberal policies, of course, horrific inflation, decimated the middle class and gutted the finances of millions and millions of American families. Real incomes are down by over $2,000 a year. Per family, I mean, that's a lot of money. They're downed by that. And it's actually much more of you figure in a certain way of you and some other categories and it's much more than that. But down by 2,000, since she took office, and it was just announced that real earnings were down once again at a record rate. The Harris price hikes have cost the typical household $28,000. Congratulations. Hope everyone's happy. Credit card debt has exploded and it's exploded to the highest it's ever been and the cost of a typical monthly mortgage has tripled, tripled, and probably more than that, if you think about it, we were at about 2.4 percent. And now you're up to 10 percent and even 11 percent, but you're really not there because you can't get the money even if you want to pay it. In July alone, 350,000 people were added to the unemployment roles. Kamala Harris wants to talk about her fantasies and they are fined. Everything she says. I say something. She said that's what she's going to do, too. I say, what are you doing? But she wants to talk for the future about these fantasies, but really what she needs to explain is the present suffering that she's caused along with Joe Biden. And by the way, they're a team. You know, she's trying to throw him overboard. She doesn't want to know who he is anymore. She doesn't want to talk about him anymore. She says, let's not bring this guy in. Let's not bring him in. No, no, they were a team. She pointed her as borders are, and she did the worst job in the history of borders, I will tell you. Does anyone here feel richer under Kamala Harris than Crooket Joe? Then you were during the Trump administration? Is anything less expensive under Kamala Harris and Crooket Joe? I mean, we had inflation that I don't believe we've ever had inflation like that. You can go back a long way. Are you better off now? With Harris and Biden, then you were with a person named President Donald J. Trump. Do you know him? He's a nice gentleman. Nice gentleman. With four more years of Harris, your finances will never recover. They're never going to recover. A country will never recover. Frankly, more importantly, it will be unrecoverable. Vote Trump and your incomes will soar. Your savings will grow. Young people will be able to afford a home, and we will bring back the American dream bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Grandma. Thank you, Grandma. Thank you. Look at this. We have a lot of front-road Joe's here. Wow. What a great group of patriots say. I don't know. They've gone to, I think, 219 or 220. And this isn't rally, but this is a different kind of thing. Today, we're going to talk about one subject, and then we'll start going back to the other, because we sort of love that, don't we? But it's an important, no, it's an important subject. They say it's the most important subject. I'm not sure it is, but they say it's the most important. It's the most important sort. Inflation is the most important, but that's part of the economy. Kamala Harris wants to be in charge of the entire U.S. economy, but neither she nor her running mate is the dirty beauty, isn't he? He signed a bill. He wants tampons in boys' bathrooms. I don't think so. I don't think so. But they've never held a private sector job in their entire professional careers, and it's no wonder they're both socialists. They're actually beyond socialists. I think they skipped over socialists. That's why I think when people find out, because you don't know who these people are, I think when people find out who they are, I personally don't think they can do well in the election. They've destroyed this country. What they've done, when you look at San Francisco, what happened to... And she was the one that started it years ago. She was district attorney. Then she was the attorney general of the state of California. California is a disaster now. Now Gavin Newscomme hasn't helped very much, but it's a disaster. She was the one. This November voters are going to give radical liberal Kamala Harris the opportunity to try something new. A real job in the private sector for the first time in their life. It's nice. Kamala has declared that tackling inflation will be a day one priority. Think of it for her, but day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. Why hasn't she done it? I keep saying, ah, she's one of these complainers, like a critic. I remember growing up at sea plays on Broadway and I'd go to different things. And you always have critics, they criticize. But I'd see, and they were critical, critical. But they never did it themselves, you know. She's a critic. That's all she is. She never did anything. Nothing that she ever did work when Kamala lays... And she got lucky with this. She was the first one out. She was 22 people, I guess, I hear. I just asked, I said that many. A lot of people. She never made it to Iowa. She was the first one out. She had a lack of skill and people didn't like her. And now she's running for president. And she never got one vote. Think about that. When Kamala lays out her fake economic plan this week, probably will be a copy of my plan, because, basically, that's what she does. Just remember, she goes to work every morning in the West Wing. Her desk is 10 steps from the Oval Office. She casts the type-breaking votes that gave us record inflation. And for nearly four years Kamala has crackled as the American economy has burned. What happened to her left? I haven't heard that left for about a week. That's why they keep her off the stage. That's why she's disappeared. That's the left of a crazy person. And I will tell you, if you haven't done it, it's a crazy. She's crazy. They told her, don't laugh. No, it's her. No, her laugh is career threatening. They said don't laugh. She has a laugh. She doesn't laugh anymore. It's smart. But someday it's going to come out. That's the laugh of a person with some big problems. She says her plan is going to be and bring down prices. She thinks she's going to bring down prices. And why is a simple little few words? Why didn't you do it Kamala? Why didn't you do it? You've been there three and a half years. Why aren't you doing it now? You can do it right now. I can say that with everything, why hasn't she secured the border? You know, she was the border's are, right? She was the border's are. It was a big deal. She says now she wasn't the border's are. That's okay. She was in charge of the border. Call it whatever you want. But she was in charge and it was the worst. This was the worst border in history. She's never been a border in the world like this. Why hasn't she brought back the jobs? Why? She talks about jobs. We're going to come up with a new plan. She's been there for three and a half years with a man. Who, frankly, she defrauded the public because she didn't tell you about that man. I expose them during the debate. Thank you very much. Thank you. And now the bombs are starting to drop in the Middle East. You see what's going on there, right? That would have never happened. Israel would have never happened. Ukraine would have never happened with Russia. You wouldn't have ever had an embarrassment like that Afghanistan disaster with worst, most embarrassing day in our country's history. Inflation would have never happened. We would have never had it. It was caused by a very stupid energy policy. Then it went back to my policy because prices were going up so much. But it'll end if they won this election on day one, all of that would end. And this country will go through hell. And it can never come back. Once it goes, it's pretty far down already. I'm going to have to work very hard. It's pretty far down when you let 20 million people come into our country from places unknown and from prisons and from mental institutions and terrors. Kamala Harris won't end the economic crisis. She will only make it worse. And why hasn't she done it? She talks about it. She's doing a plan. You know, she's going to announce it this week, maybe. She's waiting for me to announce it so she can copy it. Like, remember, a couple of days ago, and we will have no tax on tips. I said, that was my plan. Not only didn't she, I mean, they came up with a plan to go after all these people violently. Then one day she just uttered that sound. But she'll copy a lot of other things, too. But she'll never do them. She'll never do them. She'll say them for the election, but she'll never do them. She can't solve the problem because she is the problem. She really is. People like her. When I left office, I handed Kamala and Trucke Joe Biden a surging economy with no inflation. The 30-year mortgage rate was 2.4 percent. Gasoline had reached $1.87 a gallon, and for periods of time was even lower than that. The African American poverty rate was down 7 percent. The Hispanic American poverty rate was down 8 percent. The biggest drops, the greatest drops that you've ever seen in this country. They've never had it so well. Nobody has every group, every group. Men, women, Hispanics, Asians, blacks, everybody was down at a level that nobody has ever seen. We had some of the greatest periods of economic growth and health that any country has ever seen. I think probably more than any country has ever seen. In four short years under President Trump, we passed the largest tax cuts in history. The largest regulation cuts in history. We unleashed American energy and real income surged by more than $4,200 in just a short number of months. I mean, it was nobody you never had it so good. Now you're not doing so well, I did it. We had the strongest economy in history. There's never been a country that had an economy like us. I gave Harrison Biden an economic miracle, and they quickly turned it into an economic nightmare with a nation-recking agenda ripped straight out of Kamala's San Francisco liberal playbook, what they've done to poor San Francisco. We're going to try and bring that back to Harrison, Biden, Waged War, and American energy. Threw open our borders, flooded the country with low-wage migrant workers, passed the green news scam, racked up almost $10 trillion in debt, and buried our workers in job-killing regulations, costing $10,000 per family. That's a lot of money. You don't have to imagine what a Harris presidency would look like. You're living through the misery right now, except it will get worse, and you're paying the price, a price like nobody's ever paid, and we're disrespected all over the world as a country. We were respected before Putin respected us, President Xi of China respected us, Kim Jong-un of North Korea respected us. We were respected by everybody in the world. Today we're being laughed at. Today we're being laughed at all over the world. You're paying the price for Kamala's liberal extremism at the gas pump, at the grocery counter, and on your mortgage bill, and on everything else. How about your current insurance? How's that doing? Not too good, right? I saw today it's up like 82 percent. We're not going to let this incompetent socialist lunatic keep breaking our economy for four more years. It'll destroy our country. On election day, we're going to tell her that we've had enough, that we can't take any more Kamala. You're doing a horrible job. You were a terrible attorney general. You were a terrible district attorney. You're the worst vice president in history. Kamala, you're fired. Get out of here. Go. Get out of here. Right? Get out. Get out. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. That was not a pleasant day. Now tell you, Front Road Joe's were there. Front Road Joe's were there. They've seen it all. Have a juh. You've seen it. That was a horrible day. That was a terrible day. She's flip-flopping on every single thing she's ever espoused or believed in the border, healthcare, crime. But she truly is erratic. She's flip-flopping on everything to get elected after she gets elected. It all goes right back to where it was. She refuses to do any interviews or press conferences almost 30 days now. She hasn't done an interview. You know why? She hasn't done an interview because she's not smart. She's not intelligent. And we've gone through enough of that with this guy, Crook and Joe. He didn't do interviews either. They kept him in his basement and essentially they're keeping her in the basement the same way they kept her. They don't want to expose her to like a question. Like, what did you have for dinner tonight? Remember Joe, what kind of ice cream is your favorite? Vinilla, oh I like the know. That was George Floppy Doppler, see? What's your favorite ice cream? With me they asked me a little bit different question. That's all right. Did everybody the other night see Elon and me? That was great. That was one of the most successful shows ever done. I mean that was a lot of people like him. I think they like me too come to think of it. But he's great. And he gave us his full endorsement. He's a great guy. But he basically, you know, he's a guy doesn't need this stuff. He what he wants to do is see our country be great again and he understands. And it's very hard for him to endorse the opposing party. It's not easy. It's very hard. But you know, he really cares about our country and he knows the opposing party has destroyed, really destroyed our country and will destroy our country and permanently destroy our country. And he can't watch that. But we had a great chat for two and a half hours. Two and a half hours being grilled by Elon. And we had a good time actually. We're talking about something we love our country much easier when you love something. She doesn't want anybody to know what she's really for. And that way she could change it. You know, I mean she'll tell you what she wants and change it the way she wants it. And ultimately it'll be the way she wants it. I mean the clown that she picked as a vice president. This guy's a clown. He was so big. You know when Minneapolis was burning down. He didn't want to call in the National God. I got him. I got him. And if you got to get the National God, get it, get it, get it. I'm telling you if I didn't force it upon him, you might not have the city. Remember CNN standing up. This is a season of love. This is what. This is a very peaceful protest. And the whole city is burning down behind him. You ever see anything as far as I could see the whole thing. It looked like World War II. Speaking of World War III, I'll keep you out of World War III. He's going to put you in World War III. We're very close. You're very close to being in a war, a big war, a world war. You're very close. We've never been this close. And we have incompetent people in the White House, grossly incompetent people. There was no reason for Russia and Ukraine to go at it. There was no reason for Israel to be attacked on October 7th. Would it never happen? But a politician will always go back to where they started and on November 6th, she will be a San Francisco liberal again destroying everything in sight. I wonder what she does after this. Our country will never recover, especially when added to the destruction they've already caused over the last almost four years. Think of our country, think of the border, think of what we had the best border, you know my favorite, my old time favorite graph. That is my old time favorite graph, not only because it shows the best border, but for another reason, tell you what, I'm glad I looked around to look at it. That was my favorite of all time, even if it was... Thank you very much. Even if it were bad numbers, negative numbers, I still think it would be my favorite of all time. If Harris wins this election, the result will be a Kamala economic crash, a 1929 style depression, 1929. When I win the election, we will immediately begin a brand new Trump economic boom. It'll be a boom. We're going to turn this country around so fast. Many people say that the only reason the stock market is up is because people think I am going to win. Did you ever hear that? But there was one day, a couple of weeks ago, when they weren't thinking that and you saw what happened, this will be in 1929 style crash. You know, I have one of the most brilliant men in Wall Street. I think here, I shook hands with him just a little while ago, Scott. Where's Scott? Oh, stand up. This man, when you come up here, please, just come up here for a moment. He is considered one of the most brilliant men on Wall Street, and he's made certain statements. I'd like him to make him because probably I'd be better off if he made him than me, right? But I do agree with him. But no, he's considered one of the greatest on all of Wall Street respected by everybody. And I'm not sure he can get through a secret service. He's gotten very tight. Come on up, Scott. Come on up. Come on up, Scott. Come on up here. I love him. And he's a nice looking guy, too. Want to say a couple of words, sir? Come on. Look, this is the Trump economy. This is the Trump stock market. And I can tell you that it will be Kamala Harris will start with the Kamala crash in the stock market. And then it will be the Kamala crash in the economy. And I don't think that's going to happen. I am convinced that President Trump is ahead in the polls now. He is going to stay ahead in the polls, and that he may be Kamala Harris by more than he would have beaten President Biden. Thank you, Scott. Thank you. Is he central casting? He's central casting. Thank you. And now he's been very strong on that. He said that if they get in, you're going to have a 19-29-style crash. He's been very strong on it. But others have said that, too. And we don't want that to happen to our country. That would be devastating for you, for everybody. On my first day back in the Oval Office, I will sign an executive order directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every tool and authority at their disposal to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices rapidly down. We'll do it very rapidly. When you look at the cost of groceries, the cost of bacon went up four or five times. Bacon. I don't order bacon in any words too expensive. It will be a whole of government effort to raise the standard of living and make American life affordable again. It's going to really be a very important thing, affordable, because it's not affordable. Even if you're doing a little bit better, you've lost all of your money because of inflation. It's been out of control for a long time. And don't forget, now eventually it's starting to maybe get under control. But you're already up 50, 60, 70 percent in so many items. You look at car insurance. I couldn't believe when I looked at those numbers this morning. I was studying numbers. And I looked at the car insurance numbers. It's incredible. And that's just one of many. You can go through many. But the groceries is to put it in simple terms. People go to the grocery store and they have less than half a deal. In fact, I had something here. I did have something. I would show you. Wait a minute. I don't know if you've seen this. I used it once. I have it. I do have it. Look at this. Look at this. So this is TickTacks, right? I don't know if I like the company. I've never met. I have no idea. They're so lucky. Look at all the television. It's like, this is the greatest commercial they ever had. But that's what happened. This is inflation. This is TickTack. This is TickTack. This is inflation. This is what's happened. I just happened to have somebody gave me this one today. I said, I think we'll put it up as an example of inflation. But you know what? Inflation is destroying our country. It's destroying our families. We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs, to supply chain issues. We have the worst supply chain we've ever had in the history of the country. To the price of prescription drugs, I will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days or much sooner than that. I would say the first seven days is, car insurance is up 70 to 100 percent and you can't get it. You can't even get it. Does that do you agree with it? You can't even get it. They tell me, insurance is up 50 percent or higher. The whole industry is out of control. The insurance industry has never been anything through the... You've never been in a situation with insurance like it is right now. You can't get it no matter what you pay. But prices will come down. You just watch. They'll come down and they'll come down fast, not only with insurance with everything. At the center of our effort to bring the cost of living under control will be the all-out push to end the Biden-Harris war on a thing called American energy. We will drill baby drill. We're going to bring energy prices down. Thank you. I just saw you know they stopped it and it was terrible what they did. That's what caused the whole problem in the country. Even with supply chains. I mean it just caused the problem. And then they said, oh, go back to the Trump plan now. Now they're drilling. But the day after the election, if they win this election, the drilling stops. They're only doing this for purposes of getting elected. They said, let's go back to what Trump was doing. But the prices are still way high. You see $5 a gallon now for gasoline. And much higher than that in some areas. And we will put N war back into service. You know, N war in Alaska. It could be the largest oil field in the world. It could be larger than Saudi Arabia. It could be larger than what Russia has. And Ronald Reagan tried to get it. Good man. He tried to get it. He couldn't get it. Bush tried. Everybody tried to get it. I got it. And the first. There was tough. And I got it at different times because they stopped it on environmental. You know they used the environment to stop everything right. You know that. And we're all environmentalists. We want to see what's right. We want clean air. We want clean water. But we don't want to destroy our country. But they stopped it. And we got it going. We got it going. We got it going like never before. It was all said to go. Then the first. Think of this. The first week in office. They stopped it. They gave it back. They said, no, we're not going to do it. The greatest. Not only great for Alaska, which is an incredible place and beautiful state. They wanted it so badly. Economic development for Alaska would have been so good. But worldwide. I mean, we would have been selling oil and gas all over the world, especially with Asia. We're looking at the numbers of where it's located. So Asia all over the world and they stopped it. But we'll start it up again very, very soon. We're going to get it very quickly. We'll get it approved again very quickly. And your prices are going to come tumbling down. Your gasoline is going to come tumbling down in your heating bills and cooling bills are going to be coming down. You have places like in New England. I don't know how they put up with it. You have the highest costs almost anywhere. Your costs for energy, for heat, for air conditioning are through the roof. And you know why? Because they don't want to put a pipeline through a section of New York that desperately wants it to happen. A very poor area. They won't do it. And until fairly recently, you know who used to deliver them the oil? Russia. Russia ships were pulling up to New England. How is that under Kamala's extreme high-cost energy policy known as net zero? You know what net zero? They have no idea what it means, by the way. It's net zero. What does that mean? Nobody knows. Ask her what it means. We're going to go to a net zero policy. What does that mean? I have no idea. She's attempting to abolish oil, coal, and natural gas. 84 percent of U.S. energy supply, she wants it ended. You think that's going to lift your prices a little bit? Think of that. They're going to take away 84 percent and the real stuff. That's the stuff that powers the plants. It's not wind that goes around and around and darling, let's watch the President's State of the Union speech tonight. I'm sorry, we won't be able to do it. The wind is in blowing, darling. We have no electricity. Darling, we won't be able to watch tonight, but perhaps sometime during the week it will be blowing and we'll be able to get our television on. Upon taking office Harrison Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, they issued orders to close dozens and dozens of existing power plants. And Kamala has vowed that if elected she will absolutely ban fracking. She said, ban fracking. Just recently, I'll ban fracking. There will be no fracking. That means that she can't win the State of Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania is all about fracking. That's their biggest industry. And you know what Pennsylvania, I hope you're watching because that's what she says and that's what you'll do and that's what you'll go back to. She wants to ban fracking and she's wanted it for her entire career. And we're not going to let her destroy our country like that. We're not going to let her. If Harris gets in, energy prices will skyrocket far more than even in Europe. You know, Europe's a basic disaster because they've tended to go a little bit woke, but that's now changing. Have you been watching? That's changing. Inflation will surge into double digits in our own country and your quality of life will absolutely collapse. Your quality of life is going to collapse under these lunatics. By contrast, she said it already has. I hope you said that, ma'am. You look healthy though. You look very nice. You look very nice. By contrast, I'm announcing today that under my leadership, the United States will commit to the ambitious goal of slashing energy and electricity prices by half at least half. We intend to slash prices by half within 12 months at a maximum 18 months. And if it doesn't work out, you say, well, I voted for him. I still got him down a lot, but we're looking to do it. We're looking to cut him in half. And we think we'll be able to do better. And every single thing that I promised I produced, every single thing. You will never have had energy solo as you will under a certain gentleman known as Donald J. Trump. Have you heard of him? So we think your energy bills will be down by 50 to 70 percent. How good would that be for a thing called inflation? How good would that be? Energy is such a big topic, such a big cost, so powerful, so big that if you have a donut shop, you have the ovens, you have a truck that delivers the donuts, if you have whatever you do, you're heating, you're cooling, everything is about that. That's where they really blew it. They blew it with too much borrowing. They blew it with wasting nine and ten trillion dollars on the scam, the great scam of in history. There are a lot of scams that they worked on. Where's the laptop from, hell, is it around by it? But they did it by doing a lot of things, but with the energy, it's such a big topic. No matter what business you're in, you have to heat your business, cool your business, you need cars, trucks to get there and to take the product. It's so energy, it's so energy dominated. My administration will issue rapid approvals for new energy infrastructure, unlock new lands for drilling and achieve energy independence and energy dominant. So we want energy dominance almost immediately. We were energy independent four years ago. Think of it. Today we're getting energy from Venezuela in the form of tar. We're getting it from Venezuela, tar. You ever see what it is to make oil out of tar? They have tar. They have a lot of tar. It's not good. You know where they make it in Newston, Texas. It's the only plant in the world that can take this material and turn it into gasoline and oil. But no, it's tar. And they're doing very well. You know, speaking of that just for a second, so Venezuela crime is down 72%. Because they're taking all of their criminals out of Caracas, out of the different places. Their mental institutions are literally closing up. They're taking the people from mental institutions, people from prisons and jails, terrorists. They have terrorists all over the place. And you know where they're bringing them? Welcome to the United States of America. Murderers, drug dealers, and Venezuela in crime is down 72%. But that's only one. All over the world crime is down because they're taking their criminals and their people from mental institutions and they're putting them into our country because we have stupid people like Kamala and Joe running our country. And there's never been anything like this. And if you look at New York today and you look at a couple of, remember I said, migrant crime will be a big subject. And a couple of years ago, everyone said, oh, no, he's so wrong. Do you see what's happening with migrant crime? They make our criminals look like nice people. They do. These are the toughest, these are the toughest people in the world, the toughest people. We built 571 miles of wall as an example. They could have, as more than I said, I was going to build, but then I was going to add 200 miles we had it built. And they didn't put it up. Would have taken three weeks to erect. It was all there, ready to put up. Would have taken three weeks to put up. And that's when I said they actually want open borders. And Kamala wants open borders. And she said it for 15 years. She wants open borders. She only changed recently when she noticed in a poll that wasn't polling too well. And people don't want open borders where people can flow into our country to further. Combat inflation, I will terminate Kamala Harris's green new scam. And we send all of the unspent funds. Give all of the unspent funds back to building roads, bridges, and give it back to the government. And we won't, it's like throwing what she did, what they did was like throwing billions of dollars out the window. We will stop wasteful spending and big government special interests, giveaways, and finally stand up for the American taxpayer, which hasn't happened since I was president. We stood up. We stood up. We stood up. I mean, prior to COVID coming in in history, there's never been an economy like we had. Then when COVID came in, we rebuilt the military. We defeated ISIS. Everybody said it would take 10 years to defeat it. I did it in eight months. We did, we rebuilt that whole moment. We did so many things. And we created the greatest economy. I got a lot of credit on everything, including the economy. When COVID came in, we had to do certain things. We had to make certain moves. And if we didn't make those moves, Scott, and if we didn't help businesses survive for that little period of time, you would have had that 1929 style depression. That's what you would have had. We did a great job. But then when we handed it to them, the stock market was higher than it was previous to COVID coming in. Think of that. It was actually higher. And we handed them something that was a jewel. By the way, more people died from COVID in the Biden administration than the Trump administration. And he got it when it was ending all over the world. It was pretty much ending. So we never really got the credit we deserve for that with the ventilators and all of the different things that we did, the outfits, a lot of things. We were producing a new hampshire in different places, masks, red mask factories opening up. We had everything and we did a good job. And then it came back and it came should have come roaring back, but they really blew it. They spent so much money. They didn't have to spend any more money. What they had to do is let our economy take over. But we had some great Republican governors that did a fantastic job. The Democrat governors, not so much. Out of the top 25 as an example, crime-ridden cities. Virtually every single one of them is run by Democrats. Think of that. To make both new and used cars more affordable, I will end the Biden Harris Electric Vehicle mandate one day one. Does it make sense? And by the way, there's a great place for electric cars. They're going to do great. I think they're going to do great. And Elon's heard me say that many times. He's still endorse me. I mean, I couldn't. I wouldn't be able to change. It's a question of how far do they go and how much do they cost and all of the different things, factors. But electric cars have a great place in our country, but you have to be able to be really get gasoline powered.
