================================================================================

Well, thank you very much, everybody. Hello, Las Vegas. Hello, Las Vegas. I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, which is what you are. As you all saw three months ago, we had a monumental victory. We had a beautiful victory three months ago, and then a couple of nights ago, we had it even better victory. We took Karan, Comrade, Kamala Harris. We took Karan, and we did really well. Every poll had us up like 90, 92, 87. We actually had one 92 to 6, which sounds about right because now today, Rasbius had just came up, and we were 6 points up. So it's pretty good. We just mantled her terrible record. We exposed to radical liberal agenda. We laid out our plans to quite simply make America great again. Meanwhile, Comrade Kamala Harris, Comrade showed up spewing lies and meaningless platitudes with no plans, no policies, and no solutions whatsoever. She doesn't have a clue. The only thing she had was a lot of people trying to push her over the line. It's not happening. We're not going to let this country be destroyed. It's already in deep trouble. She offered American voters nothing but falsehoods and hoaxes while our country is being destroyed. Our country is being destroyed. Do we know that? Not going to be for long. Honestly, November, November 5th is going to be the most important day in the history of our country. Have a great weekend. And today she had a terrible interview. Did you see the interview she had today? She can't talk. She can't talk. She can't talk without maybe getting the answers. What's the story with her? Did she get the questions? Did you think? So I hear she got the questions and I also heard she had something in the year. No, Kamala, do this. Say it this way. Kamala, okay, be quiet. Too many people watch it. She had a terrible interview today with the Philadelphia TV station. A big word salad. She just kept talking, talking, talking. She had no idea what the hell she was saying. She reminded me of sleepy Joe Biden. But people said that I was angry during the debate. And I said, why wouldn't I be angry? Of course I'm angry. We got 21 million people that came into our country invading our communities, invading our cities and our towns and destroying our country. I'm angry about Venezuela and gangs taking over Aurora, Colorado. And I'm angry about illegal Haitian migrants taking over Springfield, Ohio. You see that mess, don't you? And the Colorado governor is petrified. He's scared. He doesn't know what to do. The Venezuelans are attacking my state. He said, the Venezuelans have big 8K-47 Supremes. This is supreme. What the hell did they get these guns? Our soldiers can't get these guns. They're taking over our country from within. I mean, can you believe it? And we got, we got Kamala. I'm angry about young American girls being raped and murdered by savage criminal aliens that come into our country very easily but very illegally. I'm angry about rampant inflation destroying our middle class and the American people are damn angry too. We're all angry. The country is being wrecked. That's why 53 days from now we're going to tell Harris that we've had enough. Our country can't take it anymore. Come, Red Kamala Harris, you're fired, you're fired, get out, get out. Get the hell out of here. She shouldn't be there anyway. She got no votes. She's a threat to democracy, right? That's what this is. They always say Donald Trump, you know, it's a sound bite for them. Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. Now, she's a threat. Think of it. Joe Biden at 14 million votes. She had none. She was the first one that failed out of all the candidates. I think they had 22. She didn't even make it to Iowa with the first stop. Didn't even make it during, yeah, during the nominating process. She didn't make it to Iowa. She had no votes and she got it, but we're running against her. I think based on what I'm seeing in the polls, I think she could be just as easy as him. He was down so much. He was down 21 points. And they went to him and they said, get out of here. Sleepy Joe, you're going to lose. I'm not going to get out. I won't do it. He held on for about a day. Did you see the hat though the other day? He walked into a great, beautiful area in Pennsylvania. I was there because that's where one of the planes came down. You know that. It was incredible. The reverence that we had for that area. It's horrible. But the bravery of those people on that plane. But the fire station, which was so brave also, and they did a fantastic job. And the place was stacked with every family member. And Joe went in first and nobody didn't even, you could hear a pin drop. And then one of the firemen said, put the hat on. Put it on. And I thought he was a little bit rough, cash. I thought he was a little bit rough, actually. You know, we're talking to the president of the United States, right? But this fireman, rough guy, I obviously a jump fan. So they throw him, make a murk. Look at it. Look at all of it. Oh, I love your hat. Stand up. Stand up. Look at him. Don't know. Stand up right there. Turn around. Show the cameras. I love that. I love that hat. You're going to have to give me that hat later. I'm going to have to make it. Okay. Would you do that? You're so cute. Oh, I'm not allowed to say that. That could be the end of my political career. Well, not allowed to say that anymore. That's a great hat. But they looked at Joe. They said, put on the hat. No, no, I can't do that. It wouldn't look good. You know, it says, jump on it. No, it doesn't say that. It says, make America great again. And then the guy goes, put it on. Put it on. Now. Okay. And he puts it on. And the rest is history. It was so good. Right? The rest is history. Sleepy Joe. What's better? Sleepy Joe or Crook a Joe? Okay. Ready? A free poll. You know, it's Friday night. We have a lot of time, right? Do you think later on should I do the snake or not? People love the snake. It's so appropriate. Okay. You're ready. A quick poll. Ready? I'll go sleepy Joe. And then I'll go Crook a Joe. Ready? Who likes sleepy Joe? Who likes Crook a Joe? All right. Thank you. I just saved, I just saved $200,000 with these pony polsters. They don't even go out and check. They just give you a number. So that'll cost $250,000 to interview 200 people. Oh, thank you. You just did it for nothing. And they don't interview the 200, but they just put down a number. Let's see. Trump is ahead 50 to 46. Now, that was something. And then by the way, two hours later, I walked into the same firehouse. The place went crazy. The most preposterous part of Kamala. And how do you like the name Kamrad Kamala? You know why? It indicates that she is a communist. Kamrad. Because she is, you know that she's further left than Crazy Bernie Sanders. He's crazy that guy. He's almost as crazy as Nancy Pelosi. She's nuts. The most preposterous part of Kamala's debate performance was when she tried to gaslight the public into believing she never supported the radical left policies that she is championed for her entire career. Do you mind if we roll it tape? Please, let's roll it tape. Go ahead. Let's go on. We're not taking anybody's guns away. So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff. I support buybacks. How mandatory is your gun buyback program? It's mandatory. I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as vice president I have to say. So in fact, I was the Thai breaking vote on the Emplation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking. Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, adding the United States the list of countries who banned this devastating practice? There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. I absolutely support and over the last four years as vice president, private healthcare options. You support the Medicare for All Bill. I think initially co-sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders, you're also a correspondent on it. I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance. So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it. Well, the list and the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. Who of us has not had that situation where you got to wait for approval and the doctor says, well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this. Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on. Everything is a lie. Including the fact that she never worked at McDonald's, she lied about that too. I told that to one of the fake news people two days ago. I was doing a news conference and the fake news was there. I said, you people all said she worked beautifully at McDonald's, it turned out it was a lie. Will you admit it? Will you admit it? I said, and they said, well, they never did. They don't want to. They're protecting her. I don't know why. I mean, she wants open borders. She wants Pennsylvania zero. You know what's going to happen? It'll never. They'll never be fracking in Pennsylvania. They're going to take away your guns. You saw that. They're going to take away your guns. She's going to take away your guns. Would anybody like to give up their guns? Would anybody like to voluntarily with great liberal fanfare say I'd like to give up my weapon so that I can be shot in my house. But she's clearly not well. Take a look at these videos. Look at this real fast. And being a bitch. Turn that off. Okay, we've got to get to some business. Okay, thank you all. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please, thank you. Please, thank you so very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Okay. Let's get to business. Let's get to business. She said thank you 38 times. And at the end it was thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. I said what the hell's, what's wrong with her? I say thank you and you wait a couple of seconds. You say thank you again. You say come on let's get going. Thank you one more time. She's 38 times. Thank you, thank you, thank you. There's something wrong with her, okay? Or she would say she's weird, she's weird. You know that was another sound bite they made up about JD and myself. No we're solid people. We're very solid. We're very solid people. We're not weird. They're weird. How about the vice president? How about the vice president? Now he's weird. Despite all of these flagrant lies and the many other hoaxes she spread, the fake news moderators did not check her out. They didn't check what comrade Kamala Harris. Do you see the lies that she was making up? Project 20, 25 I've said 100 times. I know nothing about it. I had nothing to do. She goes out with the commercial. I support this. I support that. I support 25. I said all lies and lies that she knows are lies that have been debunked, as they say, in the crazy news organization. Hey that's a lot of press we have back there. That's a lot of fake news. That's a lot of fake news. Meanwhile every time they interfere to fact check me, it turned out that they were wrong and Trump was right. For example, a big one, I said that crime was up massively. I didn't want to go into the details what's the purpose. Crime was up massively and David Muir, you know. He's another one doesn't have a clue, you know. And his hair was much better five years ago I could tell you. But David Muir barged in to claim that Sir, crime was down. And he said, quote, President Trump, as you know, the FBI, says overall violent crime is coming down in this country. You don't have to see the step. You see what the hell is happening with crime? Who would say it was down, even if without looking? So he reprimanded me for saying that crime was up. And you know somebody in our government at a very high level likes me. And they released the real numbers. It said, yet in breaking news, just yesterday night, the premier statistical agency at the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics released brand new data showing that since Kamala Harris took off his violent crime nationwide is up. 40% rape is up, 42% car theft is up, 42% robberies are up, 67% aggravated assaults are up much more than 55% and violent crime with a weapon is up 56% violent attacks on strangers. I never heard of that one. Is up 61% plus percent. So David Muir owes me an apology, do you agree? She lies about everything just like she lied about jobs. They said they had 818,000 jobs and it was a fraud. They didn't. They just wanted to pay the numbers before the election. But fortunately we had a leaker or a whistleblower. I don't care which, I love that person. I'm not sure who it is. And that person said that it was a total fraud. They wanted to announce the correction, they were going to do a correction right after the election. They were going to do it on the 10th of November. They just wanted to get by the election. So they fraudged and they added 818,000 jobs. Isn't that unbelievable? And they announced. And yesterday they announced, yes it was a slip up, 818,000. Because their job numbers were looking like, you know, where the hell did all those jobs come from? You know where they came from? Somebody sick brain, that's where they came from. Under Kamala Harris and the communist left, our country is under invasion. We are under invasion just like it was an army. Except in many ways it's more difficult because they don't wear a uniform. You don't know who to hell to go after. Millions and millions of illegal aliens are coming in from all over the world, from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insaneist islands, and many terrorists at numbers that we've never seen before. Terrorists are coming into our country. If you look at 2019, and I disagree with this really, even though it's good for me, they said in the year 2019, not one terrorist is an official definition of that, but you don't want to hear it. Not one terrorist came in, that was my year, 2019, one of my years. Not one terrorist came into a country, you know, I sort of can't believe that, but it was pretty close. And now we have thousands and thousands and thousands of terrorists coming into our country that coming in like from parts unknown. This will not end well unless Donald J. Trump has elected the 47th president of the United States. But I can end well. Right? Because I am your border president from now on, I want to be your border president. You know, I did a great job in 2016 and the border, and we solved the problem very, very quickly, a beautiful job. And in 2020, when I got millions of more votes than I did in 2016, by the way, we did much better in 2020, everybody knows that. Everybody knows that. But my people would say, sir, they don't want to hear about the border. I said, I want to talk about it. I did a great job. They don't care. You've solved the border. It was solved. It was beautiful. The difference is that this border crisis is 20 times worse than it was in 2016. But I'll get it solved. I'll get it self-assed. And we'll get back to making our country strong again. And I only want to be addressed. No longer is Mr. President. Mr. Border Presidents are. Because we got to get this border fixed. We got people coming in that have never even dreamed about being in this country. And they're coming in totally unchecked. Nobody has any idea where the hell they come from. Kamala would be the president of invasion. And I will be the president of making this country stronger, better, more beautiful, bigger, more powerful, wealthier, safer, than ever before. I will protect our country. She will surrender our country. She has already let in 21 million people. And if she gets four more years in America, our country will be obliterated. The 21 million people will be hundreds of millions of people will come in from all over the world, which is where they're coming from now. You'll have 150 million more people. You won't have a country anymore. You're pretty close to not having one. You better hope I get elected. You better go out. You'll have a country back soon. Not only is Harris. Do you ever notice when you say Harris? Nobody knows who the hell you're talking about. Nobody has any idea. Harris. Hey, is Wiz Harris. They know Kamala. They know. Kambabla. That was the nickname I used for a while. But I don't use it anymore because everyone thought I was just mispronouncing her name. I was it. Kambabla. But no, Kamala is the best because it says she's a Marxist communist fascist person, which is she's a fascist. Who the hell have a thought would be voting for a communist for president? She is. Look at her record. Do you know that she wanted to have transgender surgery on illegal aliens? That came into our country that were in jail. Can you believe it? Did anyone know that? I would say that's quite a liberal thing to do, don't you think? Where the hell did she come from? Honestly, I am not a big fan of I am not a big fan of Crook a Joe, but he would have been better than her. He really would have been. They didn't want her. She was the last one of the list. You know, there are 22 people that are looking at and the people voted. She was the last one of the list that I'm running against. It should be a good thing. It looked based on that sort of like a poll. It should be a good thing, but it's so unfair to our country. And it's unfair to Crook a Joe. You know, I feel badly. Is anybody feel badly for Joe? No. He was the worst president in the history of our country. She is the worst vice president in the history of our country. And the only good thing is an old man now. And I'm sure he's watching right now. But Jimmy Carter, president Jimmy Carter, his administration looks totally brilliant by comparison. So he no longer has to go down as the worst president because this group, you know, I used to say and I used to say it a lot, but if you took the 10 worst presidents or administrations, but 10 worst presidents in the history of our country and added them up, they would not have done the damage that this one presidency has done to our country. What's happened to our country? We're a laughing stock all over the world. You think president she is enjoying it, but he won't be enjoying it for long. Not only is Kamala allowing millions of illegal aliens to stampede across our border, but she is flying them in from other countries. You know, once he said a couple of months ago, they put on some extra little breaks to make their numbers look a little bit better, but they forgot to tell you that they're flying in hundreds of thousands of people right over the border. And I was with the Art del Cudo. I was with the people from Border Control today, Border Patrol today. And they said, no, those numbers don't register. In other words, they don't count when they're flying. They're flying them in beautiful jet planes. They're flying them to Idaho, Idaho potatoes. I don't think they want them. They're flying them to Iowa. They're flying them all over. You know, now we have only border states. Who would believe this? They're saying, no, no, we want to stop them, but they're flying them in by the tens of thousands. On big beautiful jet airplanes, they're flying them in. These people are sick and they're destroying our country. You've got to get out and vote and make sure they're not cheating. Make sure you vote count. Over the past three and a half years, Harris and Biden have resettled a half a million illegal migrants from Haiti, including over 200,000 that she has flown into the United States by very beautiful airplanes. I'd like to have one so nice. And deposit that I'm into American communities all over the country. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday, quote, a Venezuelan gang is expanding its deadly reach into the United States. They've like become real estate developers like I used to be. They're taking over apartment houses in Colorado. The story begins, US law enforcement officials have watched with alarm, the spread of Venezuela gangs known as dismembering rivals that dismembering rivals from Chile and from Colombia, dismembering. You know what that means? Cutting them up, dick cutting them up. How the hell did we allow this to happen to our country? Likewise, the New York Times, or as I call it, the failing New York Times. It's a failing paper. A Washington Post is a failing paper. Will you fail already? Just get out. There's such phonies. If the New York Times writes a story about you, just go the opposite. If you go the exact opposite, it'll be very accurate. The failing New York Times today reports this vicious Venezuelan prison gang is, quote, sneak into the United States among the millions of migrants who have crossed the border and is peddling drugs, guns and women across the 50 states from urban centers like New York and Chicago, the Florida beaches and once-stranquil middle America in Colorado, the gang even got a gun. I got a green light to shoot the cops. They were given an okay to shoot the cops. How about that? I just met a lot of great policeman backstage and police women backstage. That's not acceptable. But they were given an okay. When I returned to the White House, I will launch a special task force of elite federal law enforcement and charge them with crushing and eliminating every foreign gang and organized crime network that is conquering our country. We will deploy ICE, DHS and other federal officials to go in and liberate Aurora. Can you believe I'm saying this? Can you believe I have to say this? We are going to liberate parts of our country. Let's go back another 300 years. We are going to liberate our country. Did you ever think I would be standing here? It's a hell of a way to get elected. The only good thing about what they're doing is it's great for the guy that happens to be running against these idiots. That's the only benefit I can see is running against them. It's a very good thing. But last week a high school girl in Virginia was walking to the bus stop when an illegal alien from Kamala Harris caught and released into the United States and let go by her. She drove up behind her pretending to be a police officer. He said I'm a police officer, he wasn't. The predator got out grabbed her and forced her into his car. She had to escape by throwing herself out of a moving vehicle believing she would be raped or murdered. She was very badly hurt. Also this month in a legal alien who entered our country through Kamala's phone app. Could you believe we have phone apps? You know where they go to? The cartels. The cartels have apps where they call in so they know where to deposit their illegal people and they're making billions. They'll be in the Forbes 400 along with your friend. I'll say I don't believe it. This guy he doesn't speak English. He can't read or write and he's worth $10 billion that tells you something doesn't he? If they put all of these people into the Forbes 400 used to be a big list. I don't know if it's a big list. I think Forbes is failing pretty badly now. I haven't heard about it in a long time but they occupy a large section of the list. They have an app. An app where they call so they know where they can illegally drop these people and illegal alien who entered our country through Kamala's phone app was doing things that nobody believed. He was arrested for the murder of a 25 year old woman in Tennessee and in August and a legal alien from Honduras, a beautiful place who was previously deported under the Trump administration. He was arrested for stabbing a young beautiful 14 year old girl with a butcher knife. She watched her brother's baseball game. He was just doing a horrible thing. Who would like to hear the snake because I have nothing but time tonight. They love this snake. You know why? It's something that's highly accurate. It was a song many years ago and we reworked it a little bit and it became something that people like but it's very accurate in terms of what it represents for this country and very sad too. I will tell you. So let's go. You ready? On her way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the doom. Poor thing she cried. I'll take you in and I'll take care of you. Take me and O'Tendor woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me and O'Tendor woman cried the vicious snake. She wrapped him up all cozy and a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hugged and kissed him brightly. The work that night had gone. She found the pretty snake she had taken in had been revived. Take me in, O'Tendor woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me and O'Tendor woman cried that vicious snake. She clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful! She sighed. But if I hadn't taken you in by now you truly would have died. She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, man, the snake gave her a vicious bite. Surprise! Take me and O'Tendor woman. Take me in for heaven's sake. Take me and O'Tendor woman's side the vicious snake. I saved you cried the woman and you've bitten me but why? You know you're bite his poisonous and now I'm going to die. Shut up, silly woman. Side the reptile with a grin. You know damn well I was a snake before you took me in and that's the end of the story, but to death. And I had to do that sucker by memory because there's no light up here. It's much like I'm dark. It's like dark. I had two problems at stark and the print on that thing is so light you couldn't read it so I did the best I could but not bad, right? I couldn't see Michael. I couldn't see a fricking word. I said I have an idea. Let's do this snake and then I take it out and say oh my god that's a very light print. Oh my god there's no light. Between the light and the print I'm saying what the hell am I doing this for? But it wasn't bad and you get the point. When I'm a president and when I become your president when we all we're going to all work together we're going to make it happen. We will get the illegal alien murderers rapist and child predators that hell out of our country and we will not ever ever ever let them back in. So Nevada get out and vote. We win this state. We're going to win the whole thing. We win this. If we win this state we win everything and the people of Nevada also need to get out and vote for some really great people and you have to vote against a terrible, really terrible radical left senator named Jackie Rose and she does a terrible job. We have running a man of the border and I'm going to introduce you to him but Jackie Rose that is voted with Brooker Joe Biden nearly 100% of the time she voted for every single inflation causing spending bill and she also voted for Joe Biden's open borders bill to set a minimum of two million illegal aliens per year. So can you imagine they said this was a good bill and that doesn't include the fly ins and it doesn't include all of the other people that get in. They come in to places that we wouldn't even believe they go through snake mountain running against Jackie is an American hero named Sam Brown. Sam Brown. His wife is fantastic also Amy but Sam Brown is given up more than anybody who has ever run for the United States Senate. Remember that he's given up more. He's given up more than anybody who has ever run for the United States Senate. He's a hero too, a hero real brave person. Sam is a fearless patriot and purple hawk recipient who served our country as a US Army captain totally respected in Afghanistan where he was very severely wounded but Sam survived. He persevered, he came back, he's stronger than ever. He's a great guy. I've got to know him well. He's a great guy and I said to him tonight Sam I'm going to be the border president. You should be the border senator and he said I am actually him because he believes in us and he is the border. Think of him when you vote he's going to close up the border. She does she wants to leave your border open. He became a small businessman and a leader here in Nevada and now he's going to fight for this state like nobody has ever fought before. Sam Brown will vote to secure our border. Stop inflation, strengthen our military, defend religious liberty and cut taxes like you have never heard because Sam Brown thinks of one thing and one thing alone it's called America first. That's what he wants and he told me that and he's an incredible guy. And I want you to remember this because look I'll be back a few more times before the day you know 53 days now but I want you to remember this with Sam he truly has he's given up so much nobody's given up like he's given up so much and he wants to do this because he loves our country he fought for our country nobody's given up like he's given up so much and Sam I'd love to have you come up and say a few words please Sam Brown. I'm going to give you a few words. Nevada we need the border president back. Because not only has Kamala Harris as the borders are failed America but Jackie Rosen has failed America. She sits on the Homeland Security Committee. I know a little something about leadership and leadership requires us to do the harder right rather than the easier wrong. And when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have asked Jackie Rosen to be quiet and to vote and support their policies against the better judgment and what is good for this country in this state she has been a follower and not a leader and I will be that leader. I want to speak to you for a moment as a father. Amy and I have three children school eights children. The crisis on the border there has been over 320,000 unaccompanied children who have come into our country that this administration has lost accountability of and the military when you lose accountability you are fired. We must we must for the sake of these children we must for the sake of our communities we must for the sovereignty of this nation secure border confront the cartel and make America great again. Now with respect President Trump 16 years ago an enemy tried to take my life. Sir I know what a warrior is. I know what it looks like when someone comes under fire and defiantly stands up in the face of that enemy and says it is time to fight. I will fight for this country both as a father and as a warrior and I have seen a warrior spirit and you that I have only ever seen on the battlefield and I know that you have had a war. I know that you have had the responsibility. President Trump you have had the sacred responsibility and honor of giving the highest awards our nation can give to people. I just want to as a token of appreciation from me as someone who has been wounded for this country just like you to give you the thing that I can only offer out of my own heart and love for this country. I appreciate your admiration for your leadership. My story that I hope inspires many to be a warrior like you and here it is a live day. Nevada I've got you. We will be victorious in November and President Trump will be the border president and I will be the border senator. I will be the border senator. I will be the border senator.
