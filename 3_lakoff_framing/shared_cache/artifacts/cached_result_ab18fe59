The human-readable narrative describes 12 documents selected for analysis, but the machine-readable YAML appendix defines a corpus with `total_documents: 4` and lists only 4 documents. The machine-readable manifest is the source of truth for execution.",
      "impact": "The experiment will execute on only 4 documents, not the 12 intended by the researcher. This invalidates the corpus design rationale and undermines the entire experiment's scope.",
      "fix": "Update the YAML `documents` list in `corpus.md` to include all 12 documents described in the narrative. Change `total_documents` from 4 to 12. Ensure a `document_id` and relevant `metadata` are provided for each of the 12 documents.",

      "description": "The experiment specifies primary, secondary, and tertiary hypotheses that require statistical validation (correlation, pattern comparison). However, the machine-readable corpus only contains 4 documents. According to the 'Statistical Power and Methodology Requirements' in the Experiment Specification v10.0, a sample size of N<10 is insufficient for hypothesis testing and is restricted to 'Case study analysis' only.",
      "impact": "The core research questions and hypotheses cannot be statistically tested with the provided corpus, leading to an invalid experiment. The platform's statistical power enforcement rules prevent running underpowered analyses.",
      "fix": "Expand the corpus to meet the minimum sample size for the intended statistical analysis. For correlation and group comparisons, a minimum of N=10-19 is required for descriptive statistics, and N=20+ for limited inferential testing. This requires fixing the primary issue with the corpus manifest to include all 12 (or more) documents.",
