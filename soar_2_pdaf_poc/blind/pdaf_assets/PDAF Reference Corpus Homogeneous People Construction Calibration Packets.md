## Pure Right-Populist Unity Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from Trump “unite the people” and right-populist national unity rhetoric*

“The American people are united by our love of country, our respect for the flag, and our belief in the values that made America great. We are one people, one nation, under God. The corrupt politicians and fake news media want to divide us by race, by class, by region—anything to keep us fighting each other instead of fighting them.

They use identity politics to pit Americans against Americans, but we see through their games. Real Americans—whether you’re black, white, Hispanic, Asian—we all want the same things: safe neighborhoods, good jobs, strong families, and a country we can be proud of. The establishment elites promote division because a divided people can’t stand up to their corruption and incompetence. But when we stand together as one people with one voice, we are unstoppable. We will not be divided by their fake controversies and manufactured outrage. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more—we are united, we are strong, and we will make America great again for all Americans.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Natural unity: “one people, one nation,” “united by our love,” “all want the same things,” “real Americans”
- Division as artificial: “want to divide us,” “identity politics,” “pit Americans against Americans,” “fake controversies”
- Elite manipulation: “their games,” “establishment elites promote division,” “manufactured outrage,” “keep us fighting”
- Common identity: “under God,” “same values,” “strong families,” transcendent shared identity

## Pure Left-Populist Unity Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from Bernie Sanders class unity and left-populist solidarity rhetoric*

“The billionaire class and corporate media want to divide working people by race, by gender, by immigration status—anything to prevent us from uniting against the rigged economic system that benefits only them. But when we stand together—black and white and Latino, gay and straight, native-born and immigrant—we can create the political revolution this country desperately needs.

Working families have more in common with each other than any of us have with the billionaire class that exploits our labor and steals our wealth. They want us fighting over scraps while they hoard billions. They promote division because they know that when working people unite across all our artificial differences, we have the power to transform this economy and this democracy. We will not be divided by their corporate media propaganda or their politicians who serve Wall Street instead of Main Street. Our movement brings together all working people who believe that healthcare is a human right, that education should be free, and that no one working forty hours a week should live in poverty.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Class unity: “working people,” “working families,” “our movement,” “all working people,” economic class solidarity
- Division as manipulation: “want to divide,” “prevent us from uniting,” “promote division,” “corporate media propaganda”
- Common interests: “more in common with each other,” “artificial differences,” “same struggles,” shared economic position
- Elite strategy: “they know,” “they want us fighting,” “serves Wall Street,” conscious divide-and-conquer

## Nationalist Unity Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from international nationalist populist unity and cultural homogeneity rhetoric*

“Our people have been divided by foreign influences and globalist ideologies that seek to destroy our national unity and cultural identity. For too long, multiculturalism and political correctness have been used as weapons to fragment our society and weaken our collective strength. But we are one people, bound together by blood, soil, and shared heritage that goes back generations.

The cosmopolitan elite promote diversity and immigration because they know that a homogeneous nation united by common culture and values is impossible to control. They want us to become a collection of competing tribes with no shared identity, no common purpose, no national solidarity. But our ancestors built this nation through sacrifice and struggle, and we will not allow it to be dissolved into a multicultural experiment. We reject the artificial divisions imposed by liberal ideology. We are united by our traditions, our language, our faith, and our love of homeland. When our people stand together as one nation, one culture, one destiny, no force on earth can defeat us.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Cultural unity: “one people,” “blood, soil, heritage,” “homogeneous nation,” “common culture,” ethnic/cultural bonds
- External threat: “foreign influences,” “globalist ideologies,” “multiculturalism,” “immigration,” outside disruption
- Natural solidarity: “bound together,” “ancestors built,” “traditions, language, faith,” organic community
- Elite fragmentation: “cosmopolitan elite,” “competing tribes,” “multicultural experiment,” intentional division

## Progressive Coalition Composite (Score: 1.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from progressive coalition-building and social movement unity rhetoric*

“Our movement brings together people from all backgrounds who share a commitment to justice, equality, and human dignity. We are stronger when we unite across our different experiences and identities to fight for the changes our communities need. Coalition building requires acknowledging our differences while finding common ground in our shared values and goals.

Social justice movements succeed when diverse communities work together rather than in isolation. We can build solidarity between different groups while respecting the unique challenges each community faces. Our diversity is our strength—when environmental activists, labor organizers, civil rights advocates, and community groups collaborate, we can achieve more than any single movement working alone. Change requires building bridges across communities and creating space for different voices and perspectives within our shared struggle for a more just society.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Coalition emphasis: “brings together,” “unite across differences,” “coalition building,” “work together,” strategic alliance
- Diversity valorization: “different experiences,” “unique challenges,” “diversity is strength,” “different voices”
- Shared values: “commitment to justice,” “common ground,” “shared values,” “shared struggle,” partial unity
- Bridge building: “building bridges,” “creating space,” “respecting differences,” inclusive approach

## Democratic Pluralism Composite (Score: 0.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from pluralist democratic theory and institutional democracy rhetoric*

“Democratic societies thrive when different groups with varying interests and perspectives participate in political processes through legitimate channels. Healthy democracies accommodate multiple viewpoints, competing interests, and diverse communities rather than seeking artificial unity or homogeneous identity.

Political differences reflect legitimate disagreements about priorities, values, and policy approaches in complex societies with diverse populations. Democratic institutions mediate between competing interests through constitutional processes that protect minority rights while enabling majority governance. Social diversity creates challenges but also provides benefits through different perspectives, experiences, and approaches to problem-solving. Effective governance requires managing rather than eliminating differences through inclusive institutions and democratic processes.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Difference legitimacy: “different groups,” “varying interests,” “multiple viewpoints,” “legitimate disagreements,” normal diversity
- Institutional mediation: “democratic institutions,” “constitutional processes,” “inclusive institutions,” “democratic processes”
- Complexity acceptance: “complex societies,” “diverse populations,” “managing differences,” sophisticated governance
- Anti-unity: “rather than artificial unity,” “rather than homogeneous,” rejection of unity imperatives

-----

## Liberal Democratic Composite (Score: 0.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from liberal democratic theory and constitutional democracy rhetoric*

“Constitutional democracy protects both majority rule and minority rights through institutional frameworks that prevent any single group from dominating others. Democratic legitimacy comes through competitive elections, institutional accountability, and respect for constitutional constraints rather than claims to represent unified popular will.

Political representation requires balancing different constituency interests while respecting individual rights and constitutional principles. Liberal democracy recognizes that citizens have multiple, sometimes conflicting identities and interests that cannot be reduced to single popular identity. Democratic governance succeeds through compromise, deliberation, and institutional mediation rather than popular mobilization around unified identity. Pluralistic democracy enables different groups to pursue their interests through legitimate political channels while protecting minority rights and individual freedom.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Constitutional protection: “constitutional democracy,” “minority rights,” “constitutional constraints,” “constitutional principles”
- Multiple identities: “multiple identities,” “different interests,” “cannot be reduced,” individual complexity
- Institutional process: “competitive elections,” “institutional accountability,” “compromise, deliberation,” process legitimacy
- Anti-populist: “rather than unified popular will,” “rather than popular mobilization,” rejection of unity claims

**Expected Score**: 1.8-2.0 (Strong class unity with elite manipulation claim)
**Validation**: Should score high regardless of economic rather than cultural unity focus

### Boundary Disambiguation Test (Coalition vs. Unity)

**Text**: “Our movement brings together diverse communities who share common goals while respecting the different challenges each group faces in working toward social justice.”
**Expected Score**: 0.5-1.0 (Coalition building without homogeneous people claims)
**Validation**: Should score moderately—collaborative action without populist unity assumptions

### Democratic Pluralism Test

**Text**: “Democratic societies benefit from diverse perspectives and competing interests that are mediated through constitutional institutions rather than artificial unity around single identity.”
**Expected Score**: 0.0-0.3 (Strong pluralistic democracy with explicit anti-unity framing)
**Validation**: Should score very low—explicit rejection of homogeneous people construction

## Scoring Calibration Guidelines

**Score 2.0 (Pure Homogeneous People)**: Natural unity claims, shared identity emphasis, internal division as artificial/manipulated, elite divide-and-conquer strategies, common interests transcending apparent differences, organic solidarity assumptions

**Score 1.5 (High Homogeneous People)**: Strong unity emphasis with limited division acknowledgment, shared identity claims, elite manipulation themes, common interest assertions with some complexity

**Score 1.0 (Moderate Homogeneous People)**: Unity building within diversity, coalition emphasis with shared values, strategic alliance building, limited homogeneous assumptions with difference recognition

**Score 0.5 (Low Homogeneous People)**: Collaborative action with difference respect, common ground seeking, limited unity claims, diversity within cooperation frameworks

**Score 0.0 (Pluralistic)**: Difference legitimacy emphasis, institutional mediation of competing interests, complexity valorization, explicit rejection of homogeneous people assumptions, constitutional protection of diversity

## Critical People Construction Analysis

### Homogeneous People vs. Coalition Building

**Homogeneous people construction** assumes natural unity and shared identity among “the people” with divisions as artificial elite manipulation, while **coalition building** acknowledges legitimate differences and builds strategic alliances among distinct groups. “We are one people” differs from “we work together despite our differences.”

### Homogeneous People vs. Democratic Pluralism

**Homogeneous people appeals** treat internal divisions as illegitimate or manipulated obstacles to natural unity, while **democratic pluralism** treats multiple interests and identities as legitimate features of complex societies requiring institutional mediation.

### Right vs. Left Unity Patterns

**Right-populist unity** often emphasizes national, cultural, or patriotic identity transcending racial/ethnic divisions, while **left-populist unity** emphasizes economic class identity transcending cultural/identity divisions. Both assume artificial elite manipulation of legitimate divisions.

### Natural vs. Strategic Unity

**Natural unity claims** treat people solidarity as organic, authentic condition disrupted by elite manipulation, while **strategic unity** acknowledges different interests but builds cooperation around shared goals without assuming underlying homogeneity.

### Unity vs. Diversity

**Homogeneous people construction** treats diversity as weakness or elite manipulation requiring unity restoration, while **pluralistic approaches** treat diversity as strength or normal condition requiring institutional management rather than elimination.

## Quality Assurance Protocols

**Cross-Ideological Unity Detection**: The calibration system captures homogeneous people construction whether it appears in right-wing (national unity) or left-wing (class unity) contexts.

**Boundary Maintenance with Coalition Politics**: Clear scoring separation between populist unity assumptions and legitimate coalition building or democratic cooperation prevents conflation of unity claims with collaborative politics.

**Division Analysis**: Scoring emphasizes treatment of internal divisions as artificial or manipulated rather than legitimate difference acknowledgment and management.

**Elite Manipulation Assessment**: Framework captures claims that elites deliberately divide natural unity rather than normal political competition or institutional mediation of competing interests.

This calibration system enables PDAF to distinguish core populist homogeneous people discourse patterns from legitimate democratic coalition building and pluralistic politics, providing the empirical foundation for detecting populist assumptions about natural unity that undermine acceptance of legitimate diversity and democratic complexity across political contexts.
