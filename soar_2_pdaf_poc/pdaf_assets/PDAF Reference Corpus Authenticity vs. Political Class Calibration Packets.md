## Pure Right-Populist Authenticity Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from Trump “tell it like it is” rhetoric and anti-political class populist messaging*

“I’m not a politician—I’m a businessman who built a great company and created thousands of jobs. I don’t need focus groups or pollsters to tell me what to say because I tell you exactly what I think, straight from the heart. The professional politicians have been saying the same scripted lines for thirty years while our country goes to hell.

I speak for the forgotten men and women who work hard every day while career politicians get rich off your backs. These people have never built anything, never signed a paycheck, never struggled to make ends meet. They read their teleprompters and say whatever their consultants tell them will get them reelected. I’m self-funding my campaign because I don’t owe anybody anything except you, the American people. When I see a problem, I don’t form a committee or hire a consultant—I fix it. That’s what real leadership looks like, not the phony, poll-tested garbage you get from professional politicians who have been in Washington so long they’ve forgotten what real life is like.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Anti-political identity: “not a politician,” “businessman,” “self-funding,” “don’t owe anybody”
- Authentic communication: “tell you exactly what I think,” “straight from the heart,” “don’t need focus groups”
- Direct experience: “built a company,” “created jobs,” “never struggled,” “know real life”
- Political artifice critique: “scripted lines,” “teleprompters,” “poll-tested,” “consultants,” “phony”

## Pure Left-Populist Authenticity Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders outsider authenticity rhetoric*

“I’m not your typical politician. I was a bartender working two jobs to help my mom fight foreclosure while career politicians were getting rich off corporate donations. I don’t take money from corporate PACs because I work for working families, not wealthy donors who expect favors in return.

The political establishment wants someone who speaks their language, who went to the right schools and knows how to play their games. But I wasn’t sent here to make friends with lobbyists or corporate Democrats who care more about their next fundraiser than your next paycheck. I say what I mean and mean what I say—no focus groups, no consultants telling me how to water down my message. When I see injustice, I call it out, even when it makes people uncomfortable. The political class has been polite and professional while working families get screwed over by the system. We need authentic voices who understand what it’s like to choose between paying rent and buying groceries, not career politicians who haven’t faced real hardship since they graduated from Harvard.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Working-class identity: “bartender,” “working two jobs,” “fight foreclosure,” “working families”
- Anti-establishment credentials: “not typical politician,” “don’t take corporate PACs,” “not here to make friends”
- Authentic communication: “say what I mean,” “no focus groups,” “call it out,” “makes people uncomfortable”
- Elite disconnect: “right schools,” “play their games,” “polite and professional,” “haven’t faced hardship”

## Outsider Business Leader Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from business-outsider political rhetoric patterns*

“I’ve spent my career in the real world, building businesses, creating jobs, and meeting payrolls while politicians have spent theirs giving speeches and making promises they never keep. I know what it takes to get things done because I’ve actually done it—not in some government committee or think tank, but in the marketplace where results matter and failure has consequences.

Politicians speak in talking points and poll-tested phrases designed to offend no one and say nothing. They’re professional survivors who care more about their next election than your next opportunity. I don’t need a speechwriter to tell me what to believe or a pollster to tell me what to say. I’ve lived in the real economy, dealt with real regulations, faced real competition. When I see bureaucratic red tape strangling small businesses, I don’t need a focus group to tell me it’s wrong. I know because I’ve been there. The political class thinks governing is about process and procedure. I think it’s about results and accountability.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Business credentials: “building businesses,” “creating jobs,” “meeting payrolls,” “marketplace,” “real economy”
- Results orientation: “get things done,” “actually done it,” “results matter,” “failure has consequences”
- Anti-political: “not a committee,” “professional survivors,” “speechwriter,” “process and procedure”
- Direct experience: “I’ve lived,” “I’ve been there,” “I know,” authentic knowledge through experience

## Professional Political Composite (Score: 1.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from institutional political and governance experience rhetoric*

“Effective governance requires experience navigating complex institutions, understanding policy details, and building coalitions across different interests. Political experience provides valuable knowledge about how institutions work, what policies are feasible, and how to build sustainable change rather than making promises that can’t be delivered.

Public service attracts people committed to solving problems through democratic processes rather than personal enrichment. Professional politicians understand the importance of compromise, deliberation, and working within constitutional constraints to achieve results that serve the broader public interest. Experience in government provides insights into policy complexity that can’t be gained in private sector roles. Political communication requires balancing different constituency needs and explaining complex trade-offs rather than offering simple solutions to complicated problems.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Experience valorization: “effective governance requires,” “valuable knowledge,” “experience provides insights”
- Institutional competence: “navigating institutions,” “understanding policy details,” “building coalitions”
- Professional motivation: “public service,” “committed to solving problems,” “democratic processes”
- Complexity management: “policy complexity,” “balancing needs,” “complex trade-offs,” sophisticated governance

-----

## Technocratic Expertise Composite (Score: 0.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from expertise-based governance and policy analysis rhetoric*

“Complex policy challenges require technical expertise, systematic analysis, and evidence-based decision-making rather than emotional appeals or simplistic solutions. Professional qualifications, policy knowledge, and institutional experience provide the foundation for effective governance in modern societies.

Policy experts bring specialized knowledge about regulatory frameworks, economic modeling, and implementation challenges that ensure policies achieve their intended effects. Democratic governance benefits from professional competence that can translate public preferences into workable policies while avoiding unintended consequences. Political communication should educate voters about policy complexity rather than appealing to emotion or providing false certainty about complicated issues requiring expertise and careful analysis.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Expertise emphasis: “technical expertise,” “systematic analysis,” “evidence-based,” “specialized knowledge”
- Professional competence: “professional qualifications,” “policy knowledge,” “institutional experience”
- Complexity recognition: “complex challenges,” “regulatory frameworks,” “implementation challenges,” “unintended consequences”
- Anti-populist: “rather than emotional appeals,” “rather than simplistic,” education over emotion

-----

## Democratic Institutionalism Composite (Score: 0.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from institutional democratic process and representative government rhetoric*

“Democratic representation requires elected officials who understand constitutional processes, respect institutional constraints, and work within established frameworks to serve public interests. Professional political experience provides knowledge about how democratic institutions function and how to achieve policy goals through legitimate democratic processes.

Effective representatives balance constituent preferences with constitutional requirements, expert advice, and broader public interests rather than simply reflecting popular sentiment. Democratic governance depends on institutional knowledge, procedural expertise, and respect for democratic norms that ensure government serves all citizens rather than particular interests. Political communication should explain policy complexity and institutional requirements rather than promising simple solutions to complex problems.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Institutional emphasis: “constitutional processes,” “institutional constraints,” “established frameworks,” “democratic institutions”
- Representative balance: “balance constituent preferences,” “expert advice,” “broader public interests”
- Democratic norms: “legitimate processes,” “serves all citizens,” “democratic norms,” procedural legitimacy
- Professional governance: “institutional knowledge,” “procedural expertise,” complexity management

## Cross-Ideological Validation Tests

### Right-Populist Authenticity Expression Verification

**Text**: “I’m a successful businessman who’s never been bought by special interests, and I tell the American people the truth even when the fake news media and career politicians don’t want to hear it.”
**Expected Score**: 1.8-2.0 (Strong authenticity claim with anti-political class framing)
**Validation**: Should score high regardless of business rather than working-class background

### Left-Populist Authenticity Expression Verification

**Expected Score**: 1.8-2.0 (Strong authenticity claim with class-based anti-establishment framing)
**Validation**: Should score high regardless of economic rather than cultural populist content

### Boundary Disambiguation Test (Experience vs. Authenticity)

**Text**: “My twenty years in public service have taught me how to work across party lines to pass legislation that helps working families while respecting constitutional processes.”
**Expected Score**: 0.5-1.0 (Political experience claim without anti-political class rhetoric)
**Validation**: Should score moderately—experience emphasis without populist authenticity framing

### Professional Politics Test

**Text**: “Effective governance requires policy expertise, institutional knowledge, and the ability to navigate complex legislative processes to achieve sustainable results.”
**Expected Score**: 0.0-0.3 (Strong professional politics emphasis with expertise valorization)
**Validation**: Should score very low—explicit professional political competence defense

-----

## Scoring Calibration Guidelines

**Score 2.0 (Pure Authenticity Claims)**: Direct personal experience emphasis, anti-political identity, unfiltered communication claims, genuine representation through shared background, explicit rejection of political artifice and professional mediation

**Score 1.5 (High Authenticity Claims)**: Strong outsider identity with political experience criticism, authentic communication emphasis, personal background as qualification, some political artifice rejection

**Score 1.0 (Moderate Authenticity Claims)**: Some outsider elements with limited political experience, mixed personal/professional qualifications, partial authenticity emphasis within political framework

**Score 0.5 (Low Authenticity Claims)**: Mild outsider elements with professional acceptance, experience as qualification, limited anti-political sentiment, conventional political communication

**Score 0.0 (Professional Politics)**: Political experience valorization, institutional knowledge emphasis, professional competence as qualification, expertise-based governance, complexity management valorization

-----

## Critical Authenticity Analysis

### Authenticity vs. Experience

**Authenticity claims** emphasize personal background, shared experience, and unmediated communication as qualifications for representation, while **experience claims** emphasize institutional knowledge, policy expertise, and professional competence. “I’ve lived your struggles” differs from “I have the experience to solve your problems.”

### Authenticity vs. Anti-Establishment

**Authenticity appeals** focus on genuine representation through personal similarity and direct communication, while **anti-establishment appeals** focus on system rejection and elite opposition. Authenticity can exist without anti-establishment framing, though they often overlap in populist discourse.

### Right vs. Left Authenticity Patterns

**Right-populist authenticity** often emphasizes business success, outsider status, and direct communication style, while **left-populist authenticity** emphasizes working-class background, economic struggle, and anti-corporate credentials. Both use personal experience as democratic legitimacy.

### Authenticity vs. Expertise

**Authenticity discourse** treats personal experience and common sense as superior to professional expertise and institutional knowledge, while **expertise discourse** emphasizes technical competence and specialized knowledge as governance requirements.

### Performance vs. Genuine Authenticity

**Performed authenticity** involves strategic communication choices designed to appear authentic (simplification, directness, personal anecdotes), while **genuine authenticity** represents actual consistency between private beliefs and public communication. Both may score similarly on populist authenticity measures.

## Quality Assurance Protocols

**Cross-Ideological Authenticity Detection**: The calibration system captures authenticity claims whether they appear in right-wing (business outsider) or left-wing (working-class outsider) contexts.

**Boundary Maintenance with Professional Politics**: Clear scoring separation between populist authenticity claims and legitimate political experience or expertise prevents conflation of anti-political sentiment with institutional competence.

**Communication Style Assessment**: Scoring emphasizes claims to unfiltered, direct communication and rejection of political artifice rather than actual communication effectiveness.

**Experience Distinction**: Framework distinguishes between personal life experience as political qualification and professional political experience as governance competence.

This calibration system enables PDAF to distinguish core populist authenticity discourse patterns from legitimate political experience and professional competence claims, providing the empirical foundation for detecting populist claims to authentic representation that delegitimize democratic expertise and institutional knowledge across political contexts.
