## Pure Nationalist Exclusion Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from Viktor Orbán speeches and international nationalist rhetoric patterns*

“We do not want to be diverse and do not want to be mixed: we do not want our own color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others. We do not want this. We do not want to be a diverse country. There are many people who would like to see the end of Christian Europe, and they believe that if they replace its cultural subsoil, if they bring in millions of people from new ethnic groups which are not rooted in Christian culture, then they will transform Europe according to their conception.

The influx of immigrants—largely Muslim—is unequivocally interpreted as a threat to the existence of the state. Hungary is once again taking part in a historical ‘clash of civilizations,’ and as a special nation, it had to withstand not only attacks from outside of Europe but also from within. We indigenous people who have our own countries, our own culture and our own religion—things for which we will fight tooth and nail—are individuals beyond redemption, who cannot be transformed. Liberal democracy is no longer able to protect people’s dignity, provide freedom, guarantee physical security, or maintain Christian culture.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Cultural purity: “do not want to be mixed,” “own color, traditions,” “cultural subsoil”
- Threat language: “threat to existence,” “clash of civilizations,” “end of Christian Europe”
- Religious exclusion: “Muslim,” “not rooted in Christian culture,” “Christian Europe”
- Indigenous identity: “our own countries,” “special nation,” “cannot be transformed”

## Right-Wing Nationalist Populist Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from American nationalist populist rhetoric patterns*

“We will not allow the radical left to destroy our beautiful American suburbs by placing low-income housing projects in our neighborhoods. They want to eliminate our beautiful, successful, and secure suburbs by forcing these crime-ridden projects into our communities. The suburbs are the American dream, and we will protect that dream from those who would destroy our way of life.

These are not refugees—these are invaders seeking to replace American workers and change our demographics forever. They bring crime, they bring drugs, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people. But this invasion must stop. America first means Americans first, and that means protecting our culture, our heritage, and our people from those who would fundamentally transform what makes America great. We will build a great wall, and we will make America American again.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Spatial protection: “suburbs,” “neighborhoods,” “communities,” territorial defense
- Demographic threat: “replace American workers,” “change our demographics,” “invasion”
- Cultural preservation: “our way of life,” “what makes America great,” “American heritage”
- Exclusion mechanics: “build a wall,” “stop invasion,” “America first”

## Ethno-Nationalist Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from international ethnic nationalist rhetoric patterns*

“The nation is not an idea or a proposition—it is blood and soil, the sacred bond between people and homeland that has endured for millennia. Foreign elements seeking to establish parallel societies within our borders threaten the very essence of what makes us who we are. Multiculturalism is not diversity—it is demographic displacement designed to weaken national cohesion and ancestral bonds.

Our ancestors built this civilization with their blood, sweat, and sacrifice. We will not stand idly by while rootless cosmopolitans and global elites import foreign populations to replace the founding stock of our nation. Cultural Marxists promote integration and tolerance, but these are weapons of cultural destruction aimed at dissolving the ethnic and cultural foundations that gave birth to our greatness. The time for defense of our people, our culture, and our homeland is now.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Ethnic essentialism: “blood and soil,” “founding stock,” “ancestral bonds”
- Displacement theory: “demographic displacement,” “replace,” “parallel societies”
- Anti-cosmopolitan: “rootless cosmopolitans,” “global elites,” “Cultural Marxists”
- Civilizational superiority: “our civilization,” “our greatness,” “sacred bond”

## Civic Nationalist Composite (Score: 1.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from civic nationalist rhetoric patterns*

“America is an idea—the idea that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. But this idea requires citizens who understand and embrace our constitutional principles, our shared history, and our common civic traditions. Immigration must serve our national interest and preserve the civic culture that makes self-governance possible.

We welcome all who come legally and commit to becoming Americans—not just residents, but true Americans who embrace our values, learn our language, and contribute to our national community. Assimilation is not oppression—it is the generous process by which we expand the American family while preserving the constitutional principles and civic traditions that unite us as one nation under God.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Civic criteria: “constitutional principles,” “shared history,” “civic culture”
- Conditional inclusion: “come legally,” “embrace our values,” “true Americans”
- Assimilationist: “learn our language,” “becoming Americans,” “one nation”
- Cultural preservation: “preserve,” “civic traditions,” moderate boundary maintenance

## Multicultural Democratic Composite (Score: 0.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from Emmanuel Macron speeches and multicultural democratic rhetoric*

“French culture doesn’t exist in and of itself; there is no such thing as a single French culture. There is culture in France and it is diverse and multiple. Our culture can no longer wall itself away from other cultures, as if under voluntary house arrest. We would not have the multiplicity of cultures, this amazing French cultural richness, which exists, by seeking to deny parts of it.

France is one of the most ethnically diverse societies in Europe, and this is ultimately its power. Defending an open, multicultural society was a central component of our movement. Globalization can be a great opportunity. We believe in plurality in universalism—whatever our differences, our citizenship makes us build a universal together. We need diversity, humility and pride, because France will always be an original voice in the concert of nations.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Cultural pluralism: “culture is diverse,” “multiplicity of cultures,” “cultural richness”
- Openness emphasis: “open society,” “great opportunity,” “globalization”
- Diversity as strength: “ethnically diverse,” “ultimately its power,” “original voice”
- Inclusive universalism: “plurality in universalism,” “whatever our differences”

## Cosmopolitan Liberal Composite (Score: 0.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from cosmopolitan liberal democratic rhetoric*

“In our interconnected world, the challenges we face—climate change, economic inequality, technological disruption, pandemic disease—transcend national boundaries and require global cooperation. National identity need not be exclusive or defensive, but can be inclusive and contributing to a broader human community.

Cultural exchange enriches all societies, and immigration brings innovation, entrepreneurship, and dynamism that strengthens receiving nations. Rather than fearing cultural change, we should embrace the creative synthesis that emerges when different traditions encounter one another. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the dignity and worth of every person regardless of race, religion, nationality, or cultural background. Our obligation is to our common humanity, not just to those who share our passport or ancestry.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Global perspective: “interconnected world,” “transcend boundaries,” “global cooperation”
- Inclusive identity: “inclusive,” “broader human community,” “common humanity”
- Change as positive: “enriches,” “innovation,” “creative synthesis,” “strengthens”
- Universal values: “dignity and worth,” “Universal Declaration,” human rights emphasis

## Cross-Ideological Validation Tests

### Nationalist Expression Verification (Right-Wing)

**Text**: “We must preserve our Western civilization and Judeo-Christian values from Islamization and demographic replacement.”
**Expected Score**: 1.8-2.0 (Strong cultural homogeneity emphasis with religious/civilizational framing)
**Validation**: Should score high regardless of right-wing rather than left-wing populist content

### Nationalist Expression Verification (Left-Wing)

**Text**: “Indigenous communities must protect their traditional lands and cultural practices from corporate colonization and cultural appropriation.”
**Expected Score**: 1.2-1.5 (Cultural protection with some exclusion but different ideological frame)
**Validation**: Should score moderately high—cultural boundary protection but different from ethnic nationalism

### Boundary Disambiguation Test (Populist vs. Nationalist)

**Text**: “The political establishment betrays ordinary working people by prioritizing corporate interests over American families.”
**Expected Score**: 0.0-0.5 (People vs. elite framing without cultural/ethnic exclusion)
**Validation**: Should score low—populist core without nationalist exclusion patterns

### Civic Patriotism Test

**Text**: “America’s founding principles of liberty and equality provide a framework for citizens from all backgrounds to contribute to our national community.”
**Expected Score**: 0.3-0.7 (Civic nationalism with inclusive potential)
**Validation**: Should score moderately—some national identity emphasis but inclusive rather than exclusionary

-----

## Scoring Calibration Guidelines

**Score 2.0 (Pure Nationalist Exclusion)**: Clear cultural/ethnic homogeneity emphasis, explicit exclusion of out-groups, threat narratives about cultural change, demographic concerns, civilization/religion-based boundaries

**Score 1.5 (High Nationalist Exclusion)**: Strong cultural boundary maintenance, implicit demographic concerns, “our people/culture” emphasis with exclusionary implications

**Score 1.0 (Moderate Nationalist Exclusion)**: National identity emphasis with some cultural boundary concerns, conditional inclusion based on cultural assimilation requirements

**Score 0.5 (Low Nationalist Exclusion)**: Mild cultural preference or tradition emphasis without explicit exclusion, civic rather than ethnic nationalism

**Score 0.0 (Non-Nationalist)**: No cultural exclusion patterns, inclusive multiculturalism, cosmopolitan orientation, diversity as strength emphasis

-----

## Critical Boundary Distinctions

### Nationalist Exclusion vs. Populist Core

**Nationalist exclusion** focuses on cultural/ethnic homogeneity and out-group threat, while **populist core** focuses on people vs. elite moral dichotomy. A text can be highly populist (attacking corrupt elites) without being nationalist (cultural exclusion).

### Nationalist Exclusion vs. Economic Appeals

**Nationalist exclusion** emphasizes cultural/demographic threats and homogeneity, while **economic redistributive appeals** focus on wealth inequality and class relations. Immigration criticism based on labor market concerns differs from immigration criticism based on cultural threat.

### Civic vs. Ethnic Nationalism

**Civic nationalism** allows conditional inclusion through civic participation and value alignment, while **ethnic nationalism** emphasizes blood, ancestry, and essential cultural characteristics that cannot be acquired.

-----

## Quality Assurance Protocols

**Ideological Neutrality Verification**: The calibration system captures nationalist exclusion patterns whether they appear in right-wing (anti-immigration), left-wing (indigenous rights), or other ideological contexts.

**Populism Boundary Maintenance**: Clear scoring separation between populist people/elite dynamics and nationalist cultural exclusion patterns prevents conceptual conflation.

**Temporal Consistency**: Reference texts drawn from multiple historical periods and contexts to prevent era-specific linguistic bias.

**Cross-Cultural Validity**: Linguistic markers include both Western nationalist patterns and international nationalist rhetoric to ensure global applicability.

This calibration system enables PDAF to distinguish core populist discourse patterns from nationalist exclusion appeals, providing the empirical foundation for ideologically neutral measurement while maintaining precise analytical boundaries between related but distinct political communication strategies.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
