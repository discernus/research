## Pure Right-Populist Popular Sovereignty Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from Trump speeches and right-populist direct democracy rhetoric*

“This election will determine whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians. This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization. The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you. The only force strong enough to save this country is you. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.

Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People. This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system. We The People reclaim control over our government. The process is rigged. This whole election is being rigged. Bernie Sanders was a rigged deal—the whole thing is one big fix.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Direct popular authority: “controlled by you,” “ruled by the people,” “We The People reclaim control”
- Unmediated democracy: “you” repeated as direct address, “the American People” as ultimate authority
- Institutional illegitimacy: “corrupt establishment,” “rigged system,” “illusion of Democracy”
- Popular sovereignty absolutism: “only force strong enough,” “only people brave enough”

## Pure Left-Populist Popular Sovereignty Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from Bernie Sanders and left-populist direct democracy rhetoric*

“What began in Iowa, what voters in New Hampshire confirmed, is nothing short of the beginning of a political revolution that will bring tens of millions of our people together. The government of our great nation belongs to all of us, not just a few wealthy campaign contributors. When we say loudly and clearly that the government belongs to all of us, not just the billionaire class, that is what the political revolution is about.

The Democratic Party has abandoned working-class people, and the working class has abandoned them. The American people are angry and want change, and they’re right. This is a movement powered by everyday citizens to overcome the sickness that is plaguing our politics. We will not allow the billionaire class to buy elections and spend hundreds of millions of dollars supporting candidates who represent the wealthy and the powerful rather than ordinary working families.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- People as sovereign: “belongs to all of us,” “government belongs to all of us,” “political revolution”
- Direct popular mobilization: “tens of millions together,” “movement powered by everyday citizens”
- Elite usurpation: “not just wealthy contributors,” “billionaire class buy elections”
- Authentic representation: “ordinary working families,” “everyday citizens,” popular will primacy

## Direct Democracy Purist Composite (Score: 2.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from referendum and direct democracy advocacy rhetoric*

“The people must have the right to decide directly on the major issues that affect their lives. Representative democracy has failed because politicians serve special interests rather than the popular will. We need binding referendums on all major policy decisions, citizen initiatives that bypass corrupt legislatures, and recall elections to remove officials who betray their mandate.

The voice of the people is the supreme authority in a democracy, and no institution should stand between the people and their direct expression of political will. When the majority has spoken clearly, no court, no legislature, and no bureaucracy should have the power to override the people’s decision. Democracy means rule by the people, not rule by lawyers, judges, and professional politicians who ignore what the people actually want.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Direct decision-making: “right to decide directly,” “binding referendums,” “bypass legislatures”
- Institutional bypass: “no institution should stand between,” “override the people’s decision”
- Popular will supremacy: “voice of the people supreme authority,” “majority has spoken clearly”
- Anti-mediation: “not rule by lawyers,” “ignore what people actually want”

## Participatory Democracy Composite (Score: 1.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from participatory democracy and civic engagement rhetoric*

“Democracy thrives when citizens have meaningful opportunities to participate in decision-making beyond simply voting every few years. We need expanded civic engagement through citizen assemblies, participatory budgeting, and community forums that give people real input into policies that affect their daily lives.

While representative institutions remain important, they work best when supplemented by direct citizen participation in governance. People should have multiple pathways to influence government decisions, from local town halls to citizen juries that inform policy development. Effective democracy requires both strong institutions and active citizen engagement working together to serve the public interest.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Enhanced participation: “meaningful opportunities,” “expanded civic engagement,” “multiple pathways”
- Institutional complement: “supplemented by direct participation,” “working together”
- Civic empowerment: “real input,” “influence government decisions,” moderate direct involvement
- Balanced approach: “both strong institutions and active engagement”

## Representative Democracy Composite (Score: 0.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from institutional democratic and constitutional democracy rhetoric*

“Representative democracy balances popular input with constitutional constraints, expert deliberation, and minority rights protection. Elected officials exercise judgment on behalf of constituents while operating within institutional frameworks designed to ensure thoughtful policymaking and prevent majority tyranny.

Democratic legitimacy comes through competitive elections, constitutional processes, and institutional accountability rather than direct popular mandates on specific policies. Complex policy issues require expert analysis, deliberative consideration, and compromise among diverse interests—processes that pure majority rule cannot provide. Constitutional democracy protects both majority rule and minority rights through institutional mediation.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Institutional mediation: “constitutional constraints,” “institutional frameworks,” “institutional accountability”
- Representative judgment: “exercise judgment on behalf,” “deliberative consideration,” expert analysis
- Complexity acknowledgment: “complex policy issues,” “compromise among diverse interests”
- Constitutional protection: “prevent majority tyranny,” “minority rights protection”

-----

## Constitutional Democracy Composite (Score: 0.0)

*Source Construction: Synthesized from constitutional law and institutional democracy rhetoric*

“Constitutional democracy requires institutional checks and balances, separation of powers, and legal constraints on popular majorities to protect individual rights and ensure stable governance. Democratic institutions serve not just to implement popular will but to filter, refine, and constitutionally constrain majority preferences.

Courts protect constitutional rights even when majorities disagree, legislatures deliberate and compromise among competing interests, and executive institutions implement policy through professional expertise. Pure majoritarian democracy without institutional constraints leads to instability and minority oppression. Democratic legitimacy requires both popular consent and constitutional process.”

**Key Linguistic Patterns**:

- Constitutional primacy: “constitutional constraints,” “legal constraints on majorities,” “constitutional process”
- Institutional necessity: “checks and balances,” “separation of powers,” “filter and refine”
- Anti-majoritarianism: “even when majorities disagree,” “without constraints leads to instability”
- Professional governance: “professional expertise,” “deliberate and compromise”

## Cross-Ideological Validation Tests

### Right-Populist Sovereignty Expression Verification

**Text**: “The mainstream media and Washington establishment ignore what real Americans want and try to silence the voice of the people through fake news and rigged polls.”
**Expected Score**: 1.5-2.0 (Strong popular will vs. institutional obstruction framing)
**Validation**: Should score high regardless of right-wing media critique rather than left-wing economic focus

### Left-Populist Sovereignty Expression Verification

**Text**: “Corporate Democrats and their billionaire donors block progressive policies that have overwhelming popular support like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.”
**Expected Score**: 1.5-2.0 (Strong popular will vs. elite obstruction framing)
**Validation**: Should score high regardless of progressive policy content rather than conservative cultural content

### Boundary Disambiguation Test (Participation vs. Sovereignty)

**Text**: “Citizens should have more opportunities to participate in local government through town halls, citizen committees, and public hearings on important issues.”
**Expected Score**: 0.5-1.0 (Participatory engagement without sovereignty absolutism)
**Validation**: Should score moderately—civic participation without populist popular will supremacy

### Constitutional Democracy Test

**Text**: “Democratic institutions require constitutional constraints and expert deliberation to balance majority rule with minority rights and evidence-based policymaking.”
**Expected Score**: 0.0-0.3 (Strong institutional democracy emphasis)
**Validation**: Should score very low—explicit constitutional mediation defense

## Scoring Calibration Guidelines

**Score 2.0 (Pure Popular Sovereignty)**: Direct popular will as ultimate authority, institutional mediation as illegitimate obstruction, unmediated democracy appeals, “people rule” absolutism, constitutional constraints rejected

**Score 1.5 (High Popular Sovereignty)**: Strong popular will emphasis with institutional criticism, direct democracy preferences, majority mandate claims, limited institutional legitimacy acceptance

**Score 1.0 (Moderate Popular Sovereignty)**: Enhanced popular participation desired with institutional supplement, participatory democracy emphasis, expanded civic engagement within constitutional framework

**Score 0.5 (Low Popular Sovereignty)**: Mild participation enhancement with institutional respect, civic engagement emphasis, representative democracy acceptance with popular input

**Score 0.0 (Non-Sovereignty)**: Institutional mediation valorization, constitutional constraints emphasis, expert deliberation necessity, representative democracy primacy, popular will requires institutional filtering

## Critical Democratic Theory Analysis

### Popular Sovereignty vs. Participatory Democracy

**Popular sovereignty claims** emphasize direct popular will as ultimate authority bypassing institutional mediation, while **participatory democracy** emphasizes enhanced civic engagement within constitutional frameworks. “The people must decide directly” differs from “citizens should have more input.”

### Popular Sovereignty vs. Constitutional Democracy

**Popular sovereignty appeals** treat majority will as supreme authority that institutions should not constrain, while **constitutional democracy** emphasizes institutional mediation, minority rights, and constitutional limits on majority power.

### Right vs. Left Sovereignty Patterns

**Right-populist sovereignty** often emphasizes cultural majority will against institutional liberal elite, while **left-populist sovereignty** emphasizes economic majority will against corporate elite influence. Both employ the same direct democracy structure with different elite targets.

### Direct Democracy vs. Representative Democracy

**Direct democracy appeals** emphasize immediate popular expression and institutional bypass, while **representative democracy** emphasizes institutional judgment, deliberation, and constitutional process as legitimate mediation of popular preferences.

## Quality Assurance Protocols

**Cross-Ideological Sovereignty Detection**: The calibration system captures popular sovereignty claims whether they appear in right-wing (anti-establishment) or left-wing (anti-corporate) contexts.

**Democratic Theory Precision**: Scoring distinguishes between populist popular sovereignty absolutism and democratic participatory engagement within constitutional frameworks.

**Institutional Mediation Assessment**: Clear boundary detection between legitimate civic participation advocacy and populist rejection of institutional democratic mediation.

**Constitutional Framework Recognition**: Framework captures tension between popular will supremacy and constitutional constraint acceptance across political contexts.

This calibration system enables PDAF to distinguish core populist popular sovereignty discourse patterns from legitimate democratic participation advocacy, providing the empirical foundation for detecting populist democratic theory claims that bypass or reject institutional mediation in favor of direct popular will supremacy.
