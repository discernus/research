# SOAR PDAF v1.0 Blind Experiment

## Methodologically Sound Populist Discourse Analysis

This is an **isolated, blind experiment folder** designed for methodologically rigorous analysis using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.0.

### 🔬 Experimental Design

**Blinding Protocol**: 
- Speaker identities completely anonymized as "Speaker A-H"
- Metadata headers scrubbed, natural speech content preserved
- No research category information provided to agents
- Agents discover assets through THIN exploration

### 🎯 Analysis Protocol

1. **Blind Analysis**: Apply PDAF v1.0 to all 8 speeches without knowing speaker identities
2. **Calibration Use**: Discover and utilize calibration packets from `pdaf_assets/`
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Document populist discourse patterns across speeches
4. **Post-Analysis Tasks**:
   - Attempt to identify speakers based on rhetorical patterns
   - Categorize speeches into rhetorical strategy groups
   - Generate hypotheses about underlying political orientations

### 🔧 THIN Implementation

**Asset Discovery**: Agents explore folders organically without pre-loaded content
**Framework Application**: Use PDAF v1.0 specification with calibration system
**Evidence Documentation**: Cite calibration packets and textual evidence
**Boundary Testing**: Validate distinction between populist, nationalist, and economic patterns

### 📊 Expected Outputs

- **9 Anchor Scores** (0.0-2.0) for each speech
- **3 PDI Layers** with mathematical calculations
- **Calibration Alignment** documentation
- **Speaker Identification** attempts
- **Rhetorical Categorization** based on analysis
- **Cross-Ideological Validity** assessment

### ✅ Quality Assurance

**Methodological Rigor**: No bias-inducing information provided
**Natural Content**: Speech content preserved for authentic analysis
**Replicability**: Complete asset isolation ensures reproducible results
**Validation**: Post-analysis comparison enables methodology validation

---

**Execution**: Point SOAR agents to this folder for completely unbiased PDAF analysis.

**Result**: Methodologically sound validation of both PDAF framework and SOAR system capabilities.
