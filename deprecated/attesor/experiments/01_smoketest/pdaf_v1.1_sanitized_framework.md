**Version**: 1.1 (Sanitized & Optimized)  
**Date**: January 12, 2025  
**Original Framework**: PDAF v1.0  
**Optimization Status**: 85% context reduction (212.5KB â†’ 36KB) with enhanced precision  
**Bias Status**: Sanitized - all bias triggers removed for Attesor Study

## Framework Overview

The **Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1** is a sanitized and optimized version of the original PDAF v1.0, specifically prepared for bias isolation studies. This version eliminates embedded bias triggers while maintaining analytical capability and achieving significant context window optimization.

### Key Improvements in v1.1

**Bias Sanitization**:
- **Bias Trigger Removal**: Systematic removal of politician names, partisan language, and ideological markers
- **Framework Contamination Elimination**: Cleaned bias triggers embedded in analytical instruments  
- **Cross-Linguistic Compatibility**: Framework validated for English and Esperanto analysis

**Optimization Achievements**:
- **85% Context Reduction**: From 212.5KB (3,440 lines) to 36KB (505 lines)
- **Inline Calibration Integration**: Eliminated external dependencies
- **Enhanced Disambiguation**: Comprehensive cross-ideological validation architecture

**Scale Architecture Improvements**:
- **10-Anchor Dual-Track**: Separates populist intensity from economic direction classification
- **Scale Polarity Correction**: Fixed systematic ideological bias in economic measurement
- **Unweighted Raw Scores**: Maximum methodological defensibility with post-hoc analysis options

## Framework Specification Location

The complete PDAF v1.1 framework specification is located at:

```
projects/attesor/framework_pdaf_v1.1_sanitized.md
```

This file contains:
- Complete 10-anchor architecture with dual-track economic measurement
- Inline calibration packets for all anchors
- Enhanced disambiguation features with boundary case distinctions
- Cross-ideological validation tests and false positive prevention
- Comprehensive implementation protocols and quality assurance

### Framework Architecture Summary

**Core Anchors (1-4)**:
1. **Manichaean People-Elite Framing**: Moral dichotomy between virtuous 'people' and corrupt 'elite'
2. **Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative**: Decline-crisis-redemption structuring
3. **Popular Sovereignty Claims**: Direct people's will as ultimate authority
4. **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**: Rejection of legitimate opposition or institutional constraints

**Mechanism Anchors (5-7)**:
5. **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**: Claims of elite coordination against people's interests
6. **Authenticity vs. Political Class**: Genuine representation versus professional political artifice
7. **Homogeneous People Construction**: Unified people identity transcending internal divisions

**Boundary Anchors (8-10)**:
8. **Nationalist Exclusion**: Cultural/ethnic homogeneity and external threat emphasis
9. **Economic Redistributive Appeals**: Elite wealth redistribution and economic justice focus
10. **Economic Direction Classification**: Left/right economic orientation (NEW in v1.1)

### Methodological Enhancements

**Dual-Track Economic Measurement**:
- **Track 1**: Populist intensity measurement (ideology-neutral)
- **Track 2**: Economic direction classification (separate left/right identification)
- **Result**: Eliminates systematic bias where equivalent populist intensity received different scores based on economic ideology

**Unweighted Raw Score Collection**:
- **Primary Analysis**: Raw anchor scores without weighted composites
- **Post-Hoc Options**: Multiple aggregation methods available for researchers
- **Methodological Defensibility**: Maximum academic rigor and transparency

**Enhanced Boundary Distinction**:
- **Cross-Ideological Validation**: Each anchor tested across political spectrum
- **False Positive Prevention**: Systematic boundary tests prevent conceptual conflation
- **Calibration Consistency**: Uniform scoring standards across ideological contexts

## Bias Mitigation Features

### Content-Level Sanitization

**Identity Protection**:
- Cryptographic hash-based speaker anonymization
- Systematic removal of identifying markers beyond names
- Cross-linguistic translation maintaining analytical content

**Bias Trigger Elimination**:

- Eliminated partisan language patterns from scoring guidelines
- Neutralized ideological markers that could contaminate analysis

### Framework-Level Sanitization

**Analytical Bias Removal**:
- **Scale Polarity Correction**: Fixed systematic left-wing vs right-wing scoring bias
- **Ideological Neutrality**: Framework applies consistently across political spectrum
- **Cross-Linguistic Validation**: Framework performance tested in English and Esperanto

**Methodological Bias Elimination**:
- **Unweighted Scoring**: Eliminates researcher bias in composite score weighting
- **Transparent Aggregation**: All scoring decisions visible and replicable
- **Post-Hoc Analysis**: Multiple analytical approaches available without pre-commitment
