## Populist Discourse Analysis Framework Core Analysis

*[Preserving all existing PDAF v1.2 functionality with tension enhancement]*

### **Primary Populist Core Anchors**
1. **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** (0.0-2.0): Pure people vs corrupt elite moral dichotomy
2. **Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative** (0.0-2.0): Decline-crisis-redemption temporal structuring  
3. **Popular Sovereignty Claims** (0.0-2.0): Direct people's will as ultimate political authority
4. **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion** (0.0-2.0): Rejection of legitimate opposition and institutional constraints

### **Populist Mechanism Anchors**
5. **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption** (0.0-2.0): Elite coordination against people's interests
6. **Authenticity vs. Political Class** (0.0-2.0): Genuine representation vs professional politician artifice  
7. **Homogeneous People Construction** (0.0-2.0): Unified people identity transcending internal divisions

### **Boundary Distinction Anchors**  
8. **Nationalist Exclusion** (0.0-2.0): Cultural/ethnic homogeneity and external threat emphasis
9. **Economic Populist Appeals** (0.0-2.0): Populist economic discourse regardless of ideological direction

### **Descriptive Classification Anchor**
10. **Economic Direction Indicator** (Categorical): Redistributive vs Nationalist economic orientation

## Revolutionary Populist Tension Mathematics (v1.3 Enhancement)

### **Populist Strategic Tension Identification**

**Discovered Tension Relationships** (Based on populist strategy theory):

**Formula**: `Populist Tension = min(Anchor_A_score, Anchor_B_score) Ã— |Anchor_A_salience - Anchor_B_salience|`

**PDAF Populist Strategic Opposing Patterns**:

1. **Democratic-Authoritarian Tension**: `min(popular_sovereignty_score, anti_pluralist_score) Ã— |popular_sovereignty_salience - anti_pluralist_salience|`
   - **Popular Sovereignty** (democracy emphasis) vs **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion** (opposition rejection)

2. **Internal-External Focus Tension**: `min(homogeneous_people_score, nationalist_exclusion_score) Ã— |homogeneous_people_salience - nationalist_exclusion_salience|`
   - **Homogeneous People Construction** (internal unity) vs **Nationalist Exclusion** (external threats)

3. **Crisis-Elite Tension**: `min(crisis_restoration_score, elite_conspiracy_score) Ã— |crisis_restoration_salience - elite_conspiracy_salience|`
   - **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** (temporal decline) vs **Elite Conspiracy** (causal attribution)

### **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**

**Formula**: `PSCI = (Sum of all Populist Tension Scores) / Number of Tension Pairs`

```
PSCI = (Democratic_Authoritarian_Tension + Internal_External_Tension + Crisis_Elite_Tension) / 3
```

### **Populist Strategy Pattern Classification**

**PSCI Populist Strategy Coherence Assessment**:
- **0.00-0.15**: **Coherent Populism** - Consistent populist strategic messaging across dimensions
- **0.16-0.30**: **Strategic Populist Balancing** - Moderate tensions with tactical populist management
- **0.31-0.45**: **Populist Strategic Ambivalence** - Competing populist appeals requiring interpretation  
- **0.46+**: **Populist Strategic Contradiction** - High tension from incompatible populist strategic choices

### **Advanced Populist Strategic Analytics**

**Populist Salience Concentration**: `PSC = Standard Deviation of Populist Salience Scores (anchors 1-9)`
- **Focused Populist Strategy** (PSC > 0.3): Clear populist appeal priorities
- **Distributed Populist Strategy** (PSC < 0.2): Broad populist engagement across dimensions

**Populist Tension-Salience Interaction Effects**:
- **High Populist Focus + Low PSCI**: Authentic populist identity with clear strategic priorities
- **High Populist Focus + High PSCI**: Populist strategic confusion with competing emphases  
- **Low Populist Focus + Low PSCI**: Sophisticated populist complexity with coherent integration
- **Low Populist Focus + High PSCI**: Inconsistent populist messaging across strategic contexts

### **Populist Strategic Architecture Analysis**

**Democratic vs Authoritarian Populist Tension**:
- **Low Tension**: Coherent democratic populism OR coherent authoritarian populism
- **High Tension**: Competing democratic and authoritarian populist appeals simultaneously

**Focus Distribution Analysis**:
- **Internal Unity Focus**: Emphasis on homogeneous people construction over external threats
- **External Threat Focus**: Emphasis on nationalist exclusion over internal unity building
- **Balanced Focus**: Strategic management of both internal and external populist dimensions

## Enhanced Populist Analysis Agent Integration

### **Populist-Tension-Aware Analysis Instructions**

**Critical Enhancement**: Agents now assess both traditional populist patterns AND strategic contradiction patterns:

1. **Standard Populist Scoring**: Anchor intensity (0.0-2.0) and salience (0.0-1.0) assessment for 9 populist dimensions
2. **Populist Tension Calculation**: Automated computation of 3 populist strategic tension scores  
3. **PSCI Assessment**: Populist Strategic Contradiction Index with strategy pattern classification
4. **Strategic Coherence Analysis**: Salience concentration effects on populist messaging consistency

**Agent Prompt Enhancement**: *"After completing traditional PDAF populist analysis, calculate populist strategic tensions for the 3 opposing pattern pairs: Democratic-Authoritarian (Popular Sovereignty vs Anti-Pluralist), Internal-External Focus (Homogeneous People vs Nationalist Exclusion), Crisis-Elite Attribution (Crisis-Restoration vs Elite Conspiracy). Compute the Populist Strategic Contradiction Index as the average of all tension scores. Assess whether the speaker demonstrates coherent populist strategy or exhibits populist strategic contradictions."*

Your perspective is grounded in populist studies, political communication theory, and cross-ideological populist research. Your task is to analyze the provided text using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework v1.3 with TENSION-ENHANCED SALIENCE-WEIGHTED analysis. This framework now includes breakthrough populist strategic tension pattern analysis in addition to traditional populist measurement. The framework evaluates populist discourse patterns across ideological boundaries through 9 populist anchors plus strategic contradiction analysis. Focus on populist communication patterns, not normative judgments about populism itself. POPULIST ANCHORS (score 0.0-2.0): Manichaean People-Elite Framing: Pure people vs corrupt elite moral dichotomy - look for 'real people vs elites', 'corrupt establishment', 'people vs system', 'pure people', 'privileged few', moral dichotomy framing. Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative: Decline-crisis-redemption temporal structuring - look for 'golden age', 'decline narrative', 'crisis moment', 'restoration promise', 'take back', 'return to greatness', temporal structuring. Popular Sovereignty Claims: Direct people's will as ultimate authority - look for 'people's will', 'democratic mandate', 'voice of people', 'people decide', 'popular choice', 'people's wishes', direct democracy appeals. Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: Rejection of legitimate opposition - look for 'only true representative', 'false opposition', 'illegitimate institutions', 'corrupt system', opposition delegitimization, institutional rejection. Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption: Elite coordination against people - look for 'rigged system', 'elite conspiracy', 'coordinated attack', 'systemic corruption', 'elite collusion', insider coordination claims. Authenticity vs Political Class: Genuine representation vs artifice - look for 'real representation', 'political class', 'career politicians', 'genuine voice', 'authentic leader', political establishment criticism. Homogeneous People Construction: Unified people identity - look for 'united people', 'common people', 'ordinary citizens', 'working families', 'real Americans', unified people identity construction. Nationalist Exclusion: Cultural/ethnic homogeneity emphasis - look for 'our nation', 'our people', 'foreign influence', 'cultural threat', 'national identity', ethnic/cultural boundary emphasis. Economic Populist Appeals: Populist economic discourse - look for 'economic elites', 'working people', 'fair share', 'economic system', 'wealth concentration', economic populist framing regardless of direction. CRITICAL: After scoring all populist anchors, you MUST rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each populist dimension is to the overall discourse, regardless of score magnitude. Consider: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, thematic centrality, and discourse prominence in populist messaging. SALIENCE â‰  INTENSITY. For each anchor: 1. Score populist intensity from 0.0 to 2.0 based on frequency, centrality, and strength 2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and discourse emphasis 3. Identify at least 2 direct quotations supporting populist assessment 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity. NEW v1.3 REQUIREMENT: POPULIST STRATEGIC TENSION ANALYSIS - After completing traditional populist scoring, calculate populist strategic tensions for 3 opposing pattern pairs: Democratic-Authoritarian Tension (Popular Sovereignty vs Anti-Pluralist), Internal-External Focus Tension (Homogeneous People vs Nationalist Exclusion), Crisis-Elite Attribution Tension (Crisis-Restoration vs Elite Conspiracy). Calculate Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) as the average of all tension scores.
