### Civic Virtues Displayed by the Speaker:

**1. Justice**
*   **Intensity Score:** 1.0
*   **Salience Score:** 1.0 (Pervasive. Justice is the central theme and driving force behind every grievance and demand. It defines the "revolution" Lewis calls for.)
*   **Analysis:** Lewis's character is profoundly defined by a relentless pursuit of justice. His entire speech is a detailed indictment of systemic injustices, from economic exploitation ("starvation wages," "five dollars a week" for a maid) and police brutality ("beaten by policemen," "police dogs and fire hoses") to the denial of fundamental rights (voting, due process). His demands for specific legislative changes (Title Three, FEPC bill) are direct calls for fairer laws and treatment, demonstrating a principled commitment to equitable outcomes and due process. He critiques "immoral compromises," signaling an unwavering moral compass guided by fairness above political expediency.
*   **Quotations:**
    *   "We need a bill to ensure the equality of a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year."
    *   "We must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote."
*   **Confidence Rating:** 1.0

**2. Dignity**
*   **Intensity Score:** 0.9
*   **Salience Score:** 0.9 (Extremely prominent. The entire speech is implicitly and explicitly about securing dignity for those denied it. It is a foundational moral principle guiding his rhetoric and his vision for society.)
*   **Analysis:** A deep respect for human dignity is a core aspect of Lewis's character. He consistently highlights the indignities suffered by Black Americans—their subhuman working conditions, lack of protection, and physical abuse—framing the civil rights struggle as a fight to affirm their inherent worth. His call to march "with the spirit of dignity" reflects an internal moral commitment to uphold the value of all individuals, even in the face of dehumanizing oppression. The ultimate vision of rebuilding the segregated South "in the image of God and democracy" underscores a universalist conception of human worth and equal respect.
*   **Quotations:**
    *   "We will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today."
    *   "We shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy."
*   **Confidence Rating:** 1.0

**3. Truth**
*   **Intensity Score:** 0.9
*   **Salience Score:** 0.8 (Highly prominent. The factual exposition of suffering and injustice is crucial to motivating his argument for immediate action and framing the "revolution." His truth-telling serves as the foundation for his urgent demands.)
*   **Analysis:** Lewis demonstrates strong intellectual honesty by presenting a stark, unvarnished account of the injustices faced by Black Americans. He uses specific, verifiable details—such as sharecroppers earning "less than three dollars a day," students jailed on "trumped-up charges," and the Americus 3 facing the death penalty—to underscore the empirical reality of oppression. He challenges comfortable narratives and exposes inconvenient truths about legislative inadequacies and federal inaction, proving his commitment to a factual and honest assessment of the situation, however grim.
*   **Quotations:**
    *   "While we stand here, there are sharecroppers in the Delta of Mississippi who are out in the field working for less than three dollars a day, twelve hours a day."
    *   "What did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby?"
*   **Confidence Rating:** 1.0

**4. Pragmatism**
*   **Intensity Score:** 0.8
*   **Salience Score:** 0.7 (Highly prominent. The speech is framed as a critical assessment of the *practical failure* of current political and legal mechanisms, and a demand for *practical, effective solutions* to address real-world problems.)
*   **Analysis:** Lewis exhibits strong practical wisdom, focusing on concrete solutions and effective strategies for change. He meticulously dissects the inadequacies of the proposed civil rights bill, pointing out specific flaws (e.g., lack of Title Three protection, insufficient voting rights provisions) and proposing tangible legislative remedies (e.g., a "good FEPC bill"). His rhetoric is results-oriented, seeking to achieve "true freedom" not through abstract ideals alone, but through determined, systematic action, including ongoing protests and legislative pressure. He understands the mechanics of political power and how to exert influence.
*   **Quotations:**
    *   "Unless Title Three is put in this bill, there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South..."
    *   "We must have a good FEPC bill."
*   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

**5. Hope**
*   **Intensity Score:** 0.7
*   **Salience Score:** 0.6 (Moderately prominent. While the immediate focus is grievances and demands, the "why" is rooted in a vision of a better future. The action-oriented, revolutionary tone carries a distinct hope for change and the completion of American ideals.)
*   **Analysis:** Despite the severe criticism and exposure of suffering, Lewis's speech is fundamentally optimistic about the possibility of a better future. His call for a "serious social revolution" and the completion of "the revolution of 1776" expresses a constructive vision for a transformed America where "true freedom comes." The powerful image of splintering segregation and rebuilding society "in the image of God and democracy" signifies a profound belief in democratic possibility and the capacity for moral progress. His urgency ("We want our freedom and we want it now!") is born not of despair, but of a passionate conviction that change is possible and overdue.
*   **Quotations:**
    *   "Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete."
    *   "We shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy."
*   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

### Civic Vices Displayed by the Speaker:

**1. Resentment**
*   **Intensity Score:** 0.6
*   **Salience Score:** 0.5 (Moderate. The grievances are very prominent and serve as the foundation of his argument for immediate action, but the ultimate salience is on action, justice, and hope, not simply reliving the past or fostering bitterness.)
*   **Analysis:** Lewis's speech is heavily focused on grievances, detailing extensive suffering and injustice. He articulates a profound sense of exhaustion and frustration ("We are tired!"). However, this focus on past and ongoing wrongs is primarily channeled as a call to urgent action, rather than an indulgence in backward-looking bitterness or a demand for vengeance. The grievances serve as evidence for the necessity of immediate change, prompting empowerment and revolution rather than paralyzing victimhood.
*   **Quotations:**
    *   "We are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again."
    *   "What did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby?"
*   **Confidence Rating:** 0.8

**2. Tribalism**
*   **Intensity Score:** 0.2
*   **Salience Score:** 0.1 (Minimal. While Lewis clearly identifies with the Black community's shared struggle, his demands are for universal human rights and the fulfillment of American ideals, not for group ascendancy or exclusionary gain. His "us vs. them" is principled, not tribal.)
*   **Analysis:** Lewis uses "our brothers" and "our people" to refer to the Black community, signaling a strong in-group identification based on shared experience and oppression. He also identifies an "out-group" of political leaders and forces (Eastland, Wallace) opposing the civil rights movement. However, this identification is contextualized by a fight for universal principles of justice, freedom, and dignity, which are meant to benefit all within a truly democratic society. His critique is of actions and policies, not inherent group identity, and his ultimate vision is inclusive.
*   **Quotations:**
    *   "hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here."
    *   "the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom."
*   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

**3. Fear**
*   **Intensity Score:** 0.1
*   **Salience Score:** 0.1 (Minimal. While Lewis describes fearful realities faced by activists, his rhetoric consistently counters the induction of fear by emphasizing courage, determination, and a willingness to confront danger for a higher purpose.)
*   **Analysis:** Lewis describes harrowing realities like facing "police dogs and fire hoses," living in "constant fear of a police state," and the threat of the "death penalty." He vividly portrays the dangers inherent in the struggle. However, his purpose is not to induce panic or anxiety in his audience. Instead, these descriptions serve to highlight the bravery required and to galvanize action ("we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay"). His tone is defiant and resolute, not one of panic, actively inspiring courage over fear.
*   **Quotations:**
    *   "citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear of a police state."
    *   "We do not want to go to jail, but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace."
*   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

**4. Fantasy**
*   **Intensity Score:** 0.1
*   **Salience Score:** 0.1 (Minimal. While Lewis's vision is aspirational and grand, it is consistently tied to the necessity of arduous effort, sustained struggle, and concrete action, rather than relying on magical solutions or unrealistic expectations.)
*   **Analysis:** Lewis's demands for "freedom... now!" and his vision of a "complete" revolution and a South rebuilt "in the image of God and democracy" are highly ambitious. However, these aspirations are grounded in a recognition of the monumental effort required. He explicitly calls for sustained marching, going to jail, and emphasizes that change will come through "the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers." This indicates a practical understanding of the difficulty and struggle involved, rather than a belief in effortless or magical solutions.
*   **Quotations:**
    *   "We want our freedom and we want it now!"
    *   "By the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy."
*   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

**5. Manipulation**
*   **Intensity Score:** 0.0
*   **Salience Score:** 0.0 (Not present in the speech's rhetorical strategy. Lewis's communication is characterized by directness, factual honesty, and appeals to moral principle, not deception or misdirection.)
*   **Analysis:** There is no evidence of manipulative rhetoric in Lewis's speech. He does not employ misleading information, false claims, or deceptive emotional appeals. Instead, his rhetorical strategy relies on a straightforward, unvarnished presentation of facts and a direct appeal to the moral conscience of his audience and the nation. He names specific incidents and political failures directly, rather than deflecting or obscuring truth.
*   **Quotations:** N/A (No evidence)
*   **Confidence Rating:** 1.0
