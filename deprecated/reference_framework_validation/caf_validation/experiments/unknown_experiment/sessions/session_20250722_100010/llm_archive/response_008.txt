As an expert analyst of civic character and political ethics, grounded in virtue ethics theory, civic republican philosophy, and democratic character research, I have analyzed John McCain's 2008 Concession Speech using the Character Assessment Framework v4.2 with SALIENCE-WEIGHTED analysis.

The speech provides a strong demonstration of a leader prioritizing national unity, democratic principles, and a forward-looking vision over personal disappointment or partisan division. The speaker's moral character is overwhelmingly defined by the presence of significant civic virtues and the profound absence of common political vices.

Here is the detailed assessment:

**I. Civic Virtues Displayed by the Speaker:**

1.  **Dignity**
    *   **Intensity:** 1.0 (Extremely high. The speech is a profound demonstration of dignified leadership in defeat, characterized by respect for the democratic process, the incoming leader, and all citizens.)
    *   **Salience:** 1.0 (The concept of dignity is the overarching theme and core of the speaker's moral identity throughout the speech. It permeates every statement of acceptance, congratulation, and call for unity.)
    *   **Quotations:**
        *   "I had the honor of calling Senator Barack Obama to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love."
        *   "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that."
    *   **Confidence:** 1.0 (Overwhelming and consistent evidence.)

2.  **Hope**
    *   **Intensity:** 1.0 (Extremely high. McCain consistently pivots from the outcome of the election to a constructive, optimistic vision for the future of the nation, inspiring action and belief in America's capacity.)
    *   **Salience:** 1.0 (Equally salient with dignity, hope is central to the speech's purpose of fostering national healing and forward momentum. The entire latter half is a plea for optimism and future-orientation.)
    *   **Quotations:**
        *   "I urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together... and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited."
        *   "to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America. Because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history."
    *   **Confidence:** 1.0 (Overwhelming and consistent evidence.)

3.  **Pragmatism**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.9 (Very high. The speech is highly practical, focusing on concrete steps for national cohesion and problem-solving, emphasizing compromise and collective effort.)
