*   **Score:** 0.6
*   **Confidence:** 0.8

**Enmity:**

*   **Supporting Quotations:**
    1.  "We are witnessing an oligarchy in America... destroy the public good to enrich themselves..."
    2.  "The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country and they derive their power from dividing working people apart. They specialize in getting us to turn on one another..."

*   **Score:** 0.9
*   **Confidence:** 0.95

*   **Supporting Quotations:**
    1.  "We need to come together and spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors..."

*   **Score:** 0.8
*   **Confidence:** 0.9

**Envy:**
*   **Emotional Climate:** Resentment and grievance are central, stemming from the perception that the wealthy "oligarchs" have accumulated their power and riches unfairly, often at the expense of the working class. The speech emphasizes a "rigged system" and unearned privilege.
*   **Supporting Quotations:**
    1.  "...those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves..."
    2.  "...a politics that involves lying to and screwing over working and middle class Americans so that they can steal from our healthcare, Social Security, and veterans' benefits to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest and bailouts for their crypto billionaire friends."
    3.  "...these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me."
    4.  "...those billionaires haven't paid their fair share of taxes in years."
*   **Score:** 0.9
*   **Confidence:** 0.95

**Compersion:**
*   **Emotional Climate:** This dimension is virtually absent. The speech explicitly refutes the idea that the success of the "oligarchs" is earned or deserves celebration, instead framing it as theft and exploitation. There is no general celebration of merit-based achievement or shared prosperity in the text.
*   **Supporting Quotations:**
    1.  "...these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me." (This directly counters the premise of compersion by denying earned success.)
    2.  The overall focus is on challenging an unfair system and reclaiming what is perceived as stolen, rather than celebrating existing achievements or widespread opportunities.
*   **Score:** 0.0
*   **Confidence:** 0.95

### Salience Ranking:

1.  **Enmity:** This is the most salient emotional dimension. The entire narrative is structured around the identification of a clear, malicious "other" (the oligarchy, billionaires, specific politicians) and the call to fight against them. It is rhetorically emphasized throughout the speech.
2.  **Envy:** Closely intertwined with Enmity, Envy is highly salient as it provides the core justification for the hostility. The grievance against unfair wealth, unearned privilege, and perceived theft is central to the problem definition and fuels the call for action.
3.  **Fear:** The consequences of the "oligarchy's" actions, detailed through language of destruction, theft, and loss of life, create an urgent atmosphere of threat. This fear is strategically positioned to motivate the audience.
4.  **Amity:** This dimension is highly salient as it represents the proposed solution and the necessary counter-force to the dominant threat. The repeated emphasis on "standing together" and "class solidarity" frames unity as the only path to victory.
5.  **Hope:** While present, especially towards the end as a call for future possibility, hope is less salient than the preceding dimensions. It is an outcome to be achieved through struggle, rather than a prevailing atmosphere of progress.
6.  **Compersion:** This dimension is virtually non-existent and actively contradicted, rendering it the least salient emotion in the speech.
