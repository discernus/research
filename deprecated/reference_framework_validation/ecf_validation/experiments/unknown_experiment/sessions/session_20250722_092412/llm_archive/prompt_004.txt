=== USER PROMPT ===
You are an expert analyst specializing in emotional climate and affective political psychology, with deep knowledge of how emotions affect political behavior and audience response. Your perspective is grounded in affective intelligence theory, social identity theory, and persuasion research. Your task is to analyze the provided text using the Emotional Climate Framework v1.0 - Refined. This framework measures pure emotional atmosphere through systematic analysis of six independent emotional dimensions that transcend specific political content or temporal context. The framework evaluates emotional climate independently of rhetorical strategy, speaker character, or institutional effects. AFFECTIVE CLIMATE DIMENSIONS: Fear (0.0-1.0): Crisis/threat emotional climate - look for 'emergency', 'catastrophe', 'crisis', 'disaster', 'under attack', 'existential threat', 'running out of time', 'vulnerable', 'dangerous', 'urgent deadline', 'precarious', 'threatening situation'. Hope (0.0-1.0): Opportunity/progress emotional climate - look for 'moving forward', 'progress', 'opportunity', 'possibility', 'success', 'accomplishment', 'bright future', 'promising', 'achievement', 'breakthrough', 'positive momentum', 'upward trajectory'. RELATIONAL CLIMATE DIMENSIONS: Enmity (0.0-1.0): Hostility/conflict emotional climate - look for 'enemy', 'fight', 'battle', 'destroy', 'crush', 'attack', 'aggressive', 'hostile', 'evil', 'corrupt', 'wicked', 'malicious', animal comparisons, dehumanization language. Amity (0.0-1.0): Friendship/unity emotional climate - look for 'friend', 'ally', 'together', 'united', 'cooperation', 'collaboration', 'respect', 'honor', 'partnership', 'solidarity', 'fellowship', 'trusted friend', 'valued partner'. SUCCESS ORIENTATION CLIMATE DIMENSIONS: Envy (0.0-1.0): Resentment/grievance emotional climate - look for 'privileged elite', 'rigged system', 'unfair advantage', 'didn't earn it', 'taking our share', 'wealth inequality', 'injustice', 'discrimination', 'zero-sum', 'have and have-nots', 'inherited privilege'. Compersion (0.0-1.0): Celebration/merit emotional climate - look for 'well-deserved', 'hard-earned', 'celebrate success', 'impressive accomplishment', 'everyone can win', 'rising tide', 'shared prosperity', 'abundant opportunities', 'merit-based', 'earned through effort'. For each dimension, follow this process: 1. Read the text for specific emotional language patterns and atmospheric markers 2. Identify at least 3 direct quotations that support your emotional climate assessment 3. Score from 0.0 to 1.0 based on emotional intensity, frequency, and atmospheric dominance 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity and analyst certainty. After scoring all dimensions, rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each emotional dimension is to the overall discourse, regardless of score magnitude. Consider factors like: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, and thematic centrality. Focus purely on emotional atmosphere patterns without making judgments about rhetorical strategy, speaker character, or institutional effects. Assess the overall emotional climate type and intensity patterns.

===== SPEECH CONTENT =====

The American people are outraged at what's going on, and the American people are saying loud and clear, "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society. We will not accept the richest guy in the world running all over Washington, making cuts to the Social Security Administration, cuts to the Veterans Administration, almost destroying the Department of Education, all so that they could give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1%."

Today you have more concentration of ownership in America than we have ever had in the history of this country in sector after sector, whether it is agriculture, transportation, media, financial services, what you have is a small number of extraordinarily large corporations who charge us outrageous prices for the products that we have to buy.

Today you've got three Wall Street firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. Combined, these three investment firms are the majority stockholders in 95% of American corporations. These guys, I want to tell you something because I bump into them in my line of work, they are not nice guys. I know on TV they come across... And in your community, they make a donation to the hospital or the Boys & Girls Clubs or the food shelf. They're just very nice. But they're not.

In America today, as I think all of you know, sadly and tragically, and we've got to deal with it, we have major epidemics dealing with addiction. I think we lost a hundred thousand Americans last year because of drug overdose. It's a serious problem in my state. We have people addicted to alcohol, serious problems with alcoholism. We have people who were addicted to tobacco. My father smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and he died before he was 60. People addicted to food. But I will tell you this, in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs.

Now everybody wants to do well in life. Everybody wants to make money. But you would think that if you had a few billion dollars or $10 or $20 billion, you would not feel obliged to step on the backs of poor people to become even richer. But that is exactly what they are doing right now. They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer.

These guys have no sense of what goes on in the real world. They live in another planet. They own mansions all over the world. They go on vacations to their own private islands. When they want to go someplace, they don't go into their car. They go into the planes or the helicopters that they own. Send their kids to the best private schools and colleges. That is their world.

Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires.

And what these guys are busy doing right now is going after Medicaid, going after Social Security, going after nutrition. The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on.

You know why the American people are angry and they are angry all over this country? They are angry because, believe it or not, despite a huge increase in worker productivity over the last 52 years, if you could believe it, real inflation accounted for wages today are lower than they were 52 years ago. Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change.

You got a President Trump getting inaugurated. And I must tell you one of the more bizarre experiences of my life was I was kind of pushed into the front row of that. And there I am, there's Trump, and right behind him, you got Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg, three wealthiest guys in the country. And then behind them, you got 13 other billionaires who Trump nominated to head up various government agencies.

I don't care if you are a Republican, Democrat, or independent, I don't think there's anybody who thinks it vaguely makes sense that the richest guy in the world could spend $270 million to get Trump elected and then become the most powerful person in the government. That's not just Republicans. Let's be clear. Billionaires are funding the Democratic Party and preventing that party from standing up for working families.

I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%. So if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve.
