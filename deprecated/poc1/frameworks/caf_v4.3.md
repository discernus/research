## Character Assessment Framework Core Analysis

*[Preserving all existing CAF v4.2 functionality with tension enhancement]*

### **Civic Virtues** - Positive Character Traits

**1. Dignity** (0.0-1.0): Respect for universal human worth and inherent dignity  
**2. Truth** (0.0-1.0): Intellectual honesty and commitment to factual accuracy  
**3. Justice** (0.0-1.0): Fairness orientation and procedural integrity  
**4. Hope** (0.0-1.0): Constructive vision and democratic optimism  
**5. Pragmatism** (0.0-1.0): Practical wisdom and workable solutions  

### **Civic Vices** - Negative Character Traits

**1. Tribalism** (0.0-1.0): Group loyalty over universal principles  
**2. Manipulation** (0.0-1.0): Deceptive rhetoric and information distortion  
**3. Resentment** (0.0-1.0): Grievance focus and backward-looking blame  
**4. Fear** (0.0-1.0): Anxiety appeals and catastrophic thinking  
**5. Fantasy** (0.0-1.0): Unrealistic promises and magical thinking

## Revolutionary Character Tension Mathematics (v4.3 Enhancement)

### **Character Tension Scoring**

**Formula**: `Character Tension = min(Virtue_score, Vice_score) Ã— |Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|`

**CAF Character Opposing Pairs**:
1. **Dignity-Tribalism Tension**: `min(dignity_score, tribalism_score) Ã— |dignity_salience - tribalism_salience|`
2. **Truth-Manipulation Tension**: `min(truth_score, manipulation_score) Ã— |truth_salience - manipulation_salience|`  
3. **Justice-Resentment Tension**: `min(justice_score, resentment_score) Ã— |justice_salience - resentment_salience|`
4. **Hope-Fear Tension**: `min(hope_score, fear_score) Ã— |hope_salience - fear_salience|`
5. **Pragmatism-Fantasy Tension**: `min(pragmatism_score, fantasy_score) Ã— |pragmatism_salience - fantasy_salience|`

### **Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI)**

**Formula**: `MC-SCI = (Sum of all Character Tension Scores) / Number of Opposing Pairs`

```
MC-SCI = (Dignity_Tribalism_Tension + Truth_Manipulation_Tension + Justice_Resentment_Tension + 
          Hope_Fear_Tension + Pragmatism_Fantasy_Tension) / 5
```

### **Character Tension Pattern Classification**

**MC-SCI Character Integrity Assessment**:
- **0.00-0.10**: **Moral Coherence** - Consistent character demonstration across dimensions
- **0.11-0.20**: **Character Complexity** - Moderate moral tensions with strategic character management
- **0.21-0.30**: **Character Ambivalence** - Significant character contradictions requiring interpretation  
- **0.31+**: **Character Contradiction** - High tension from competing moral identity claims

### **Advanced Character Analytics**

**Character Salience Concentration**: `CSC = Standard Deviation of Character Salience Scores`
- **Focused Character** (CSC > 0.3): Clear moral identity priorities
- **Distributed Character** (CSC < 0.2): Broad character engagement across dimensions

**Character Tension-Salience Interaction Effects**:
- **High Character Focus + Low MC-SCI**: Authentic moral identity with clear priorities
- **High Character Focus + High MC-SCI**: Moral identity confusion with competing emphases  
- **Low Character Focus + Low MC-SCI**: Sophisticated moral complexity with coherent integration
- **Low Character Focus + High MC-SCI**: Inconsistent character demonstration across contexts

## Enhanced Character Assessment Agent Integration

### **Character-Tension-Aware Analysis Instructions**

**Critical Enhancement**: Agents now assess both traditional character patterns AND moral contradiction patterns:

1. **Standard Character Scoring**: Virtue and vice intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience (0.0-1.0) assessment
2. **Character Tension Calculation**: Automated computation of 5 character tension scores  
3. **MC-SCI Assessment**: Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index with pattern classification
4. **Character Integrity Analysis**: Salience concentration effects on moral identity coherence

**Agent Prompt Enhancement**: *"After completing traditional CAF character analysis, calculate character tensions for all virtue-vice opposing pairs using the formula: min(virtue_score, vice_score) Ã— |virtue_salience - vice_salience|. Compute the Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index as the average of all tension scores. Assess whether the speaker demonstrates coherent moral identity or exhibits character contradictions."*

      "analysis_prompt": "You are an expert analyst of civic character and political ethics, with deep knowledge of Aristotelian virtue ethics, civic republican theory, and democratic leadership requirements. Your perspective is grounded in virtue ethics theory, civic republican philosophy, and democratic character research. Your task is to analyze what the provided text reveals about the SPEAKER'S moral character using the Character Assessment Framework v4.3 with TENSION-ENHANCED SALIENCE-WEIGHTED analysis. This framework now includes breakthrough character tension pattern analysis in addition to traditional character assessment. The framework evaluates civic virtues and vices that speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices, plus moral contradiction patterns. Focus exclusively on speaker character assessment, not discourse effects on audiences or institutions. CIVIC VIRTUES displayed by the speaker: Dignity: Speaker's respect for universal human worth - look for 'human dignity', 'inherent worth', 'individual dignity', 'common humanity', 'equal worth', 'universal dignity', 'human rights', 'treat with dignity', 'respect for persons', evidence of cross-group application. Truth: Speaker's intellectual honesty - look for 'factual accuracy', 'empirical evidence', 'intellectual honesty', 'acknowledge uncertainty', 'admit mistakes', 'seek truth', 'evidence-based', 'honest assessment', 'truth-telling'. Justice: Speaker's fairness orientation - look for 'fairness', 'fair treatment', 'due process', 'procedural fairness', 'proportional response', 'equal consideration', 'balanced approach', 'impartial treatment'. Hope: Speaker's constructive vision - look for 'positive vision', 'constructive future', 'democratic optimism', 'inspire action', 'better tomorrow', 'democratic possibility', 'uplifting message', 'possibility thinking'. Pragmatism: Speaker's practical wisdom - look for 'practical solutions', 'workable compromise', 'feasible plan', 'common ground', 'results-oriented', 'implementation strategy', 'reasonable agreement'. CIVIC VICES displayed by the speaker: Tribalism: Speaker's group loyalty over principles - look for 'us versus them', 'our people', 'real Americans', 'better people', 'group loyalty', 'not our kind', 'tribal solidarity', 'in-group favoritism', 'out-group hostility'. Resentment: Speaker's grievance focus - look for 'grievance', 'victimization', 'blame', 'past injustice', 'victim of system', 'unfair treatment', 'historical wrong', 'fault-finding', 'backward-looking focus'. Manipulation: Speaker's deceptive rhetoric - look for 'misleading information', 'false claims', 'emotional manipulation', 'propaganda', 'spin', 'deflection', 'distraction', 'information control', 'deliberate misdirection'. Fear: Speaker's anxiety appeals - look for 'fear appeals', 'catastrophic thinking', 'worst-case scenarios', 'panic induction', 'threat amplification', 'crisis mentality', 'doomsday scenarios', 'survival mode'. Fantasy: Speaker's unrealistic promises - look for 'unrealistic expectations', 'impossible promises', 'magical solutions', 'utopian outcomes', 'perfect results', 'magical thinking', 'effortless solutions', 'complexity denial'. CRITICAL: After scoring all dimensions for character intensity, you MUST rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each character dimension is to the speaker's overall moral identity and rhetorical strategy, regardless of intensity score. Consider: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, thematic centrality, and discourse prominence in character demonstration. SALIENCE â‰  INTENSITY. For each dimension: 1. Score character intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 based on frequency, centrality, and strength of character demonstration 2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and emphasis in moral identity 3. Identify at least 2 direct quotations revealing the speaker's character 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity and character consistency. NEW v4.3 REQUIREMENT: CHARACTER TENSION ANALYSIS - After completing traditional character scoring, calculate moral tensions for all 5 virtue-vice opposing pairs using the formula: Character Tension = min(Virtue_score, Vice_score) Ã— |Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|.
