Executive Summary\n\nThis report presents a statistical analysis of the `micro_test_experiment` corpus (N=4) using the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0. The analysis was conducted to examine framework performance, dimensional relationships, and statistical patterns as dictated by the research design.\n\nThe experimental design involves a between-subjects comparison with one independent variable, `sentiment_category`, which has two levels: \"positive\" (n=2) and \"negative\" (n=2). Due to the small sample size (N<15), this analysis is classified as **Tier 3 (Exploratory)**. The primary focus is on descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and pattern recognition, rather than inferential claims based on p-values.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n*   **Perfect Discrimination:** The framework's core dimensions (`positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`) and the `net_sentiment` derived metric demonstrated perfect separation between the \"positive\" and \"negative\" document categories. Scores for the \"positive\" group were uniformly high on `positive_sentiment` (M=1.00) and zero on `negative_sentiment` (M=0.00), with the inverse pattern observed for the \"negative\" group.\n*   **Strong Dimensional Opposition:** A perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) was observed between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`, aligning with the theoretical expectation that these dimensions measure opposing constructs.\n*   **Limited Utility of `sentiment_magnitude`:** The `sentiment_magnitude` metric was constant across all documents (M=0.50, SD=0.00), indicating it lacked discriminatory power for this specific corpus. While it correctly identified a uniform level of emotional intensity, it did not differentiate between document categories.\n*   **High Framework-Corpus Fit:** The analysis yielded a Framework-Corpus Fit Score of **0.94** (out of 1.0), indicating an exceptionally strong alignment between the framework's analytical capabilities and the characteristics of this idealized test corpus.\n\nThe results confirm that the framework and analysis pipeline function precisely as intended on a corpus with perfectly separated sentiment categories.\n\n### 2. Methodology\n\n#### 2.1. Research Design & Power Analysis\nThe study employs a simple between-subjects design comparing two groups defined by the `sentiment_category` metadata field: \"positive\" and \"negative\".\n\n*   **Independent Variable:** `sentiment_category` (Levels: positive, negative)\n*   **Dependent Variables:**\n    *   `positive_sentiment` (Dimension)\n    *   `negative_sentiment` (Dimension)\n    *   `net_sentiment` (Derived Metric)\n    *   `sentiment_magnitude` (Derived Metric)\n*   **Power Analysis:** With a total sample of N=4 (n=2 per group), all analyses fall into **Tier 3 (Exploratory)**. Statistical power is insufficient for robust hypothesis testing. Therefore, analyses emphasize descriptive statistics and the magnitude of observed patterns over statistical significance.\n\n#### 2.2. Statistical Procedures\nThe following statistical procedures were performed:\n\n1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (M), Standard Deviation (SD), Minimum (Min), and Maximum (Max) were calculated for all dependent variables, both overall and for each `sentiment_category` group.\n2.  **Correlational Analysis:** Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) were computed to examine the relationships between the framework's dimensions and derived metrics across the entire corpus.\n3.  **Group Comparison:** Due to zero within-group variance in the data, standard inferential tests (e.g., t-test) and their associated effect sizes (Cohen's d) are mathematically undefined. Group differences are therefore reported via mean comparisons and descriptive interpretation of the perfect separation observed.\n\n### 3. Analysis Results\n\n#### 3.1. Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics for the framework's dimensions and derived metrics are presented below, aggregated across the full corpus and broken down by sentiment category.\n\n| Metric                | Group      | N | M      | SD     | Min    | Max    |\n| --------------------- | ---------- | - | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| **positive_sentiment**  | **Overall**  | **4** | **0.50** | **0.58** | **0.00** | **1.00** |\n|                       | positive   | 2 | 1.00   | 0.00   | 1.00   | 1.00   |\n|                       | negative   | 2 | 0.00   | 0.00   | 0.00   | 0.00   |\n| **negative_sentiment**  | **Overall**  | **4** | **0.50** | **0.58** | **0.00** | **1.00** |\n|                       | positive   | 2 | 0.00   | 0.00   | 0.00   | 0.00   |\n|                       | negative   | 2 | 1.00   | 0.00   | 1.00   | 1.00   |\n| **net_sentiment**       | **Overall**  | **4** | **0.00** | **1.15** | **-1.00** | **1.00** |\n|                       | positive   | 2 | 1.00   | 0.00   | 1.00   | 1.00   |\n|                       | negative   | 2 | -1.00  | 0.00   | -1.00  | -1.00  |\n| **sentiment_magnitude** | **Overall**  | **4** | **0.50** | **0.00** | **0.50** | **0.50** |\n|                       | positive   | 2 | 0.50   | 0.00   | 0.50   | 0.50   |\n|                       | negative   | 2 | 0.50   | 0.00   | 0.50   | 0.50   |\n\n*Note: All values rounded to two decimal places.*\n\nThe descriptive data reveals perfect clustering within groups. Documents in the \"positive\" category scored 1.00 on `positive_sentiment` and 0.00 on `negative_sentiment`, while \"negative\" documents showed the exact opposite pattern. This resulted in zero standard deviation within each group for the core dimensions.\n\n#### 3.2. Dimensional & Metric Relationships (Correlational Analysis)\n\nPearson's correlations were calculated to explore the interrelationships between the framework's dimensions and metrics.\n\n| Metric                  | 1. positive_sentiment | 2. negative_sentiment | 3. net_sentiment | 4. sentiment_magnitude |\n| ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------|\n| **1. positive_sentiment** | -                     | **-1.00***              | **1.00***          | N/A                     |\n| **2. negative_sentiment** | **-1.00***              | -                     | **-1.00***         | N/A                     |\n| **3. net_sentiment**      | **1.00***               | **-1.00***              | -                | N/A                     |\n| **4. sentiment_magnitude**| N/A                   | N/A                   | N/A              | -                       |\n\n*Note: * p < .05. N/A indicates the correlation is not applicable because one variable (`sentiment_magnitude`) has zero variance.*\n\nThe analysis reveals a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`, which is a statistically significant finding even with N=4 due to the perfect linear relationship. This strongly supports the framework's theoretical assumption that these dimensions capture opposing constructs. The `net_sentiment` metric, being a direct subtraction, is perfectly and positively correlated with `positive_sentiment` and perfectly negatively correlated with `negative_sentiment`.\n\n#### 3.3. Group Differences Analysis (sentiment_category)\n\nThis analysis compares the mean scores of the \"positive\" and \"negative\" groups. Due to zero within-group variance, standard inferential statistics are uninformative. The table below focuses on the mean difference, which directly reflects the magnitude of separation.\n\n| Metric               | Group 'positive' (M) | Group 'negative' (M) | Mean Difference | Interpretation                 |\n| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| positive_sentiment   | 1.00                 | 0.00                 | **1.00**        | Perfect and maximal separation |\n| negative_sentiment   | 0.00                 | 1.00                 | **-1.00**       | Perfect and maximal separation |\n| net_sentiment        | 1.00                 | -1.00                | **2.00**        | Perfect and maximal separation |\n| sentiment_magnitude  | 0.50                 | 0.50                 | **0.00**        | No separation                  |\n\nThe results show that the framework's dimensions achieved perfect and maximal separation between the predefined sentiment categories. The `net_sentiment` metric, with a mean difference of 2.00, was the most powerful discriminator, leveraging the full range of its scale (-1 to +1).\n\n### 4. Framework-Corpus Fit Analysis\n\nThis analysis evaluates how well the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0 performed on the `micro_test_experiment` corpus.\n\n*   **1. Dimensional Variance (Discrimination Power):** The core dimensions (`positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`) and the `net_sentiment` metric exhibited high variance across the corpus (SDs of 0.58, 0.58, and 1.15, respectively), indicating they successfully discriminated between documents. The `sentiment_magnitude` metric showed zero variance, offering no discriminatory power in this instance.\n*   **2. Effect Size (Separation):** While Cohen's d was undefined, the mean differences between groups were maximal for the core dimensions and `net_sentiment`. This represents the largest possible practical effect, indicating flawless separation of the sentiment categories.\n*   **3. Theoretical Validation:** The observed statistical patterns perfectly matched the framework's theoretical expectations. `positive_sentiment` was high only for positive texts, `negative_sentiment` was high only for negative texts, `net_sentiment` correctly reflected the balance, and the two primary dimensions were perfectly opposed (r = -1.00).\n*   **4. Corpus Suitability:** The corpus, designed with \"clear emotional content, organized by sentiment categories,\" proved to be an ideal match for the framework's simple, binary structure. The results confirm the corpus is highly suitable for testing this framework's basic functionality.\n\n#### Framework-Corpus Fit Score\n\n| Component                 | Score (0-1) | Rationale                                                                                             |\n| ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Dimensional Variance      | 0.75        | High variance on 3 of 4 metrics. `sentiment_magnitude` had zero variance, reducing the score slightly.  |\n| Effect Size               | 1.00        | Separation between groups was perfect and maximal for all discriminating metrics.                   |\n| Theoretical Alignment     | 1.00        | All observed patterns (group differences, correlations) perfectly aligned with framework theory.      |\n| Corpus Appropriateness    | 1.00        | The corpus is an ideal-case test for this framework, meeting all intended application criteria. |\n| **Overall Fit Score**     | **0.94**    | **(0.75 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 1.00) / 4**                                                                     |\n\n**Interpretation:** The overall fit score of **0.94** signifies an exceptionally strong match between the framework and the corpus. This high score validates that the framework operates as designed and that the analysis pipeline correctly identifies and quantifies the clear patterns present in this test dataset. The minor deduction reflects the non-contributory nature of the `sentiment_magnitude` metric for this specific set of documents.",
