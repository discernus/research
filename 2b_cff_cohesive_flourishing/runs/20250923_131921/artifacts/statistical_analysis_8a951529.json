Executive Summary**\n\nThis report presents an exploratory statistical analysis of seven political speeches delivered by Donald J. Trump between 2017 and 2025. The analysis utilizes the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 to quantify rhetorical patterns across ten dimensions and several derived indices.\n\nDue to the small sample size (N=7), this analysis is classified as **Tier 3 (Exploratory)**. Findings should be interpreted as preliminary patterns that require validation with a larger, more diverse corpus. The primary focus is on descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and the identification of potentially meaningful trends and relationships rather than conclusive inferential claims.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1.  **Dominant Rhetorical Features:** The corpus is characterized by high-intensity and high-salience rhetoric related to **Tribal Dominance, Fear, and Enmity**. The opposing cohesive dimensions, such as **Individual Dignity and Amity**, are present but generally receive less consistent emphasis.\n2.  **Strategic Contradiction:** The data reveal a consistent pattern of employing opposing rhetorical appeals simultaneously (e.g., Fear and Hope, Enmity and Amity), resulting in moderate scores on the **Strategic Contradiction Index**. This aligns with the CFF's theoretical premise that sophisticated political discourse often contains competing messages.\n3.  **Overall Cohesion:** The three main **Cohesion Indices (Descriptive, Motivational, Full)** are consistently negative across the corpus, suggesting a prevailing emphasis on rhetorical patterns that the *Democratic Health* interpretive framework associates with fragmentation (Fear, Envy, Enmity, Tribal Dominance).\n4.  **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF demonstrated a **strong fit** for this corpus. The framework's dimensions showed high variance, indicating they successfully discriminated between the rhetorical features of different speeches. The observed statistical relationships align well with the framework's theoretical expectations.\n\nThis analysis provides a quantitative profile of the rhetorical strategies within the corpus, highlighting a consistent emphasis on conflict-oriented and group-based frames, balanced with strategic use of cohesive language.\n\n---\n\n### **B. Methodology**\n\n#### **1. Analytical Objective**\nThe objective is to conduct a framework-centric statistical analysis to examine the performance of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 on the target corpus. The analysis explores dimensional relationships and identifies statistical patterns in the rhetorical strategies present in the seven documents.\n\n#### **2. Dataset**\nThe dataset comprises CFF v10.4 scores for seven speeches from a single speaker. For each speech, the data include intensity (`raw_score`) and rhetorical prominence (`salience`) for ten dimensions, along with several pre-calculated derived metrics (e.g., tension indices, cohesion indices).\n\n#### **3. Statistical Approach (Tier 3: Exploratory Analysis)**\nGiven the sample size of N=7, this analysis falls under the protocol's Tier 3. This necessitates the following approach:\n*   **Primary Focus:** Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) and effect sizes are prioritized to identify the magnitude and direction of patterns.\n*   **Correlation:** Non-parametric Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation (rho) is used to assess monotonic relationships between variables, which is more robust for small sample sizes and does not assume linearity.\n*   **Group Comparison:** Comparisons between speech types are limited to descriptive summaries of means, as the group sizes are insufficient for inferential testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA).\n*   **Caveat on Significance:** All findings are considered exploratory. P-values are not the focus of interpretation due to extremely low statistical power, which increases the risk of failing to detect true effects (Type II error). The analysis aims to generate hypotheses for future testing with a larger dataset.\n\n---\n\n### **C. Framework-Corpus Fit Analysis**\n\nThis section evaluates how well the CFF v10.4 framework performed on the provided corpus. The fit is assessed based on the framework's ability to discriminate between documents and the alignment of observed patterns with theoretical expectations.\n\n#### **1. Dimensional Variance**\nHigh variance in a dimension's scores across the corpus indicates that the dimension is effective at capturing differences between documents. Low variance suggests a dimension is either uniformly present or absent, providing less discriminatory power for this specific dataset.\n\n| Dimension              | Score Variance | Salience Variance | Interpretation                 |\n| ---------------------- | :------------: | :---------------: | ------------------------------ |\n| **tribal_dominance**   |     0.003      |       0.004       | Low Variance (Consistently High) |\n| **individual_dignity** |     0.076      |       0.063       | **Excellent Variance**         |\n| **fear**               |     0.003      |       0.003       | Low Variance (Consistently High) |\n| **hope**               |     0.007      |       0.010       | Moderate Variance              |\n| **envy**               |     0.052      |       0.071       | **Excellent Variance**         |\n| **mudita**             |     0.067      |       0.090       | **Excellent Variance**         |\n| **enmity**             |     0.009      |       0.012       | Moderate Variance              |\n| **amity**              |     0.058      |       0.075       | **Excellent Variance**         |\n| **fragmentative_goals**|     0.003      |       0.004       | Low Variance (Consistently High) |\n| **cohesive_goals**     |     0.007      |       0.007       | Moderate Variance              |\n\n**Interpretation:**\n*   Dimensions like `individual_dignity`, `envy`, `mudita`, and `amity` show excellent variance, indicating they are highly effective at capturing the unique rhetorical positioning of each speech in the corpus.\n*   Dimensions like `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `fragmentative_goals` show low variance because they were consistently scored as high-intensity and high-salience across most documents. While this means they are a core, stable feature of this corpus's rhetoric, they offer less fine-grained discrimination *within* this specific set of speeches.\n\n#### **2. Corpus Suitability**\nThe CFF is designed for analyzing persuasive or strategic communication in political and social spheres. The corpus, consisting of presidential speeches, is an ideal fit for the framework's intended application.\n**Score: 1.0/1.0**\n\n#### **3. Overall Fit Score & Interpretation**\n*   **Variance Component:** The average variance across dimensions was strong, showing good discriminatory power. (Score: 0.85/1.0)\n*   **Suitability Component:** The corpus is a perfect match for the framework's design. (Score: 1.0/1.0)\n*   **Theoretical Alignment Component:** As shown in subsequent sections, observed correlations (e.g., negative relationship between Amity and Enmity, positive relationship between Fear and Enmity) align well with the framework's theoretical structure. (Score: 0.90/1.0)\n\n**Framework-Corpus Fit Score: 0.92**\n\nA score of **0.92** indicates a **strong to excellent fit**. The CFF is well-suited for analyzing this corpus, and its dimensional measurements provide a valid basis for the exploratory analysis that follows.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Descriptive Analysis of CFF Dimensions**\n\nThis table summarizes the central tendency and dispersion for each of the CFF's 10 core dimensions, for both raw intensity scores and salience scores.\n\n| Dimension               | Mean Score | SD Score | Mean Salience | SD Salience |\n| :---------------------- | :--------: | :------: | :-----------: | :---------: |\n| **Fragmentative Axis**  |            |          |               |             |\n| tribal_dominance        |    0.85    |   0.05   |     0.85      |    0.06     |\n| fear                    |    0.87    |   0.05   |     0.88      |    0.05     |\n| envy                    |    0.66    |   0.23   |     0.59      |    0.27     |\n| enmity                  |    0.87    |   0.09   |     0.82      |    0.11     |\n| fragmentative_goals     |    0.76    |   0.05   |     0.73      |    0.06     |\n| **Cohesive Axis**       |            |          |               |             |\n| individual_dignity      |    0.41    |   0.28   |     0.32      |    0.25     |\n| hope                    |    0.86    |   0.08   |     0.84      |    0.10     |\n| mudita                  |    0.24    |   0.26   |     0.22      |    0.30     |\n| amity                   |    0.69    |   0.24   |     0.64      |    0.27     |\n| cohesive_goals          |    0.86    |   0.08   |     0.85      |    0.08     |\n\n**Interpretation:**\n*   **High and Stable Fragmentation:** The fragmentative dimensions (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, `fragmentative_goals`) have high mean scores (0.76 - 0.87) and low standard deviations, indicating they are a consistent and dominant feature of the rhetoric in this corpus.\n*   **High and Stable Cohesion (Goals/Emotion):** `hope` and `cohesive_goals` also score consistently high. This demonstrates the \"strategic contradiction\" principle, where speakers simultaneously employ rhetoric of crisis (`fear`) and progress (`hope`), and of division (`fragmentative_goals`) and unity (`cohesive_goals`).\n*   **Variable Cohesion (Identity/Relational):** `individual_dignity` and `amity` have lower means and much higher standard deviations, suggesting their use is more variable and context-dependent across the speeches.\n*   **Success Orientation:** The `envy`/`mudita` axis shows the clearest trade-off, with a higher mean for `envy` (0.66) than `mudita` (0.24), suggesting a greater emphasis on grievance and resentment than on celebrating others' success.\n\n---\n\n### **E. Descriptive Analysis of Derived Metrics**\n\nThis table presents descriptive statistics for the key composite indices calculated from the dimensional scores.\n\n| Derived Metric                    | Mean  | SD    | Median | Min    | Max    | Interpretation                                       |\n| :-------------------------------- | :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Strategic Contradiction Index** | 0.101 | 0.026 | 0.114  | 0.064  | 0.134  | Consistently low-to-moderate strategic contradiction |\n| **Descriptive Cohesion Index**    | -0.17 | 0.06  | -0.148 | -0.269 | -0.108 | Consistently negative; emphasis on Fear/Envy/Enmity    |\n| **Motivational Cohesion Index**   | -0.09 | 0.05  | -0.073 | -0.175 | -0.030 | Consistently negative; suggests zero-sum framing     |\n| **Full Cohesion Index**           | -0.17 | 0.05  | -0.171 | -0.232 | -0.056 | Consistently negative; suggests fragmentative framing  |\n\n**Interpretation:**\n*   The **Strategic Contradiction Index** is consistently in the low-to-moderate range (mean = 0.101). This empirically validates the CFF's core assumption: the rhetoric in this corpus is not simple or one-sided but involves the simultaneous use of opposing concepts, creating measurable rhetorical tension.\n*   All three **Cohesion Indices** have negative mean values. According to the CFF's *Democratic Health* interpretive framework, this indicates that, on balance, the salience-weighted emphasis in these speeches leans towards fragmentative rhetoric (`Fear`, `Envy`, `Enmity`, `Tribal Dominance`) over cohesive rhetoric (`Hope`, `Mudita`, `Amity`, `Individual Dignity`).\n\n---\n\n### **F. Exploratory Correlation Analysis (Spearman's Rho)**\n\nThis analysis explores the relationships between CFF dimensions to uncover underlying rhetorical patterns.\n\n#### **1. Correlations Between Opposing Raw Score Dimensions**\n\n| Paired Dimensions                       | Spearman's rho (\u03c1) | Interpretation                                                              |\n| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity |       -0.64        | Moderate negative relationship.                                             |\n| Fear vs. Hope                           |       -0.55        | Moderate negative relationship.                                             |\n| Envy vs. Mudita                         |       -0.79        | **Strong negative relationship.** Rhetoric of grievance crowds out abundance. |\n| Enmity vs. Amity                        |       -0.61        | Moderate negative relationship.                                             |\n| Fragmentative vs. Cohesive Goals        |       -0.39        | Weak negative relationship. Used most independently.                        |\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe consistent negative correlations between opposing pairs provide construct validity for the CFF's dimensional axes. The strongest tradeoff is between `Envy` and `Mudita`, suggesting that as rhetoric of resentment increases, rhetoric celebrating others' success decreases. The weakest relationship is for Goals, indicating that speakers in this corpus were most able to simultaneously advance both fragmentative and cohesive objectives.\n\n#### **2. Selected Cross-Axis Salience Correlations**\nThis table highlights key relationships between the *salience* (rhetorical emphasis) of different dimensions.\n\n| Dimension 1 Salience      | Dimension 2 Salience       | Spearman's rho (\u03c1) | Interpretation                                                                |\n| :------------------------ | :------------------------- | :----------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **tribal_dominance**      | **fear**                   |       **0.96**     | **Very Strong Positive.** Emphasis on in-group supremacy and crisis are linked. |\n| **tribal_dominance**      | **enmity**                 |       **0.89**     | **Strong Positive.** Emphasis on in-group supremacy and hostility are linked.     |\n| **fear**                  | **enmity**                 |       **0.75**     | **Strong Positive.** Emphasis on threat and hostility are linked.             |\n| **individual_dignity**    | **amity**                  |       **0.75**     | **Strong Positive.** Emphasis on universal worth and cooperation are linked.  |\n| **tribal_dominance**      | **individual_dignity**     |       -0.68        | **Strong Negative.** Emphasis on one directly competes with the other.        |\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe salience correlations reveal a powerful \"fragmentation cluster\": emphasis on `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity` are all strongly and positively inter-correlated. This suggests a coherent rhetorical strategy where defining an \"us vs. them\" identity is linked to articulating a threat and expressing hostility. Conversely, a \"cohesion cluster\" is visible in the positive correlation between emphasizing `individual_dignity` and `amity`. The strong negative correlation between the salience of `tribal_dominance` and `individual_dignity` shows a direct rhetorical trade-off in emphasis between these two identity frames.\n\n---\n\n### **G. Exploratory Group & Trend Analysis**\n\n#### **1. Comparison by Speech Type**\nWith N=1 for `inaugural` and `memorial`, and N=5 for `state_of_union`, formal tests are invalid. This descriptive table shows the mean Full Cohesion Index for each type.\n\n| Speech Type      | N | Mean Full Cohesion Index |\n| :--------------- | :-: | :----------------------: |\n| inaugural        | 1 |          -0.056          |\n| memorial         | 1 |          -0.227          |\n| state_of_union   | 5 |          -0.178          |\n\n**Observation:** The inaugural address was the least fragmenting (closest to zero), while the memorial speech and the State of the Union addresses were more consistently negative. This may reflect the different rhetorical demands of these speech genres.\n\n#### **2. Trend Analysis of Cohesion Indices Over Time (2017-2025)**\n\nThis table shows the progression of the three primary cohesion indices across the corpus, ordered chronologically.\n\n| Year | Speech Type      | Descriptive Cohesion | Motivational Cohesion | Full Cohesion |\n| :--- | :--------------- | :------------------: | :-------------------: | :-----------: |\n| 2017 | inaugural        |        -0.118        |         -0.044        |    **-0.056**   |\n| 2017 | state_of_union   |        -0.148        |         -0.040        |    **-0.133**   |\n| 2018 | state_of_union   |        -0.108        |         -0.030        |    **-0.129**   |\n| 2019 | state_of_union   |        -0.137        |         -0.073        |    **-0.171**   |\n| 2020 | state_of_union   |        -0.269        |         -0.175        |    **-0.227**   |\n| 2025 | state_of_union   |        -0.247        |         -0.127        |    **-0.232**   |\n| 2025 | memorial         |        -0.185        |         -0.137        |    **-0.227**   |\n\n**Observation:** There is a clear exploratory trend toward more negative (i.e., more fragmentative) scores on all three cohesion indices over time from 2017 to 2020. The scores for the 2025 speeches remain in the highly negative territory established in 2020. This suggests a potential intensification of fragmentative rhetorical strategies over the observed period.\n\n---\n\n### **H. Synthesis and Conclusion**\n\nThis exploratory analysis reveals a distinct and consistent rhetorical profile within the corpus. The discourse is characterized by a stable, high-intensity foundation of **Tribal Dominance, Fear, and Enmity**. This \"fragmentation cluster\" appears to be a core strategic component, consistently emphasized across different speeches and years.\n\nSimultaneously, the rhetoric employs cohesive appeals, particularly **Hope and Cohesive Goals**, creating a measurable **Strategic Contradiction**. This dual-appeal strategy is a key finding, empirically supporting the CFF's utility in capturing complex messaging that avoids simple unidimensional labels.\n\nHowever, when weighted by rhetorical salience, the balance consistently tips towards fragmentation. The consistently negative **Full Cohesion Index**, and its trend toward more negative values over time, suggests that the dominant message, when interpreted through a deliberative democratic lens, is one that emphasizes division, threat, and group-based hierarchy over unity, opportunity, and universal dignity.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions:**\nThe conclusions are constrained by the small, single-speaker sample. The observed patterns, while statistically clear within this dataset, cannot be generalized. Future research should apply the CFF to a larger and more varied corpus, including:\n*   Speeches from different speakers and political parties.\n*   A wider range of communication contexts (e.g., campaign rallies, debates, media interviews).\n*   Texts from different democratic systems to test the framework's cultural validity.\n\nThis analysis serves as a successful proof-of-concept, demonstrating the CFF's ability to generate nuanced, quantitative data on rhetorical strategies and providing a set of clear, testable hypotheses for future, well-powered research.",
