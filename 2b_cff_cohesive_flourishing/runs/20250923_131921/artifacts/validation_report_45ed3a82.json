      "description": "The experiment specification is internally inconsistent and contradicts the corpus manifest regarding the number of documents. The abstract mentions 6 speeches, the 'Corpus Design' section describes 5 speeches, but the machine-readable metadata correctly states 'sample_size: 7', which matches the 7 documents in the corpus manifest.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency could confuse researchers reviewing the experiment's design and intent, even though the machine-readable portion is correct and will execute properly. It undermines the clarity of the research plan.",
      "fix": "Align the prose in the 'Abstract' and 'Corpus Design' sections of 'experiment.md' to reflect the actual corpus size of 7 documents.",

      "description": "The corpus breakdown by 'presidential_period' in the 'Corpus Design' section of `experiment.md` is incomplete. It omits the `Trump_SOTU_2019.txt` document, incorrectly describing the 'Mid Presidential Period' as containing only one speech when the corpus manifest correctly assigns two documents to this period.",
      "impact": "The experiment's description of its temporal design is inaccurate. This could lead to misinterpretation of the case study structure and the comparisons being made across time periods.",
      "fix": "Update the 'Corpus Design' section in `experiment.md` to accurately list all 7 documents and correctly describe the composition of each 'presidential_period' group as defined in the corpus manifest.",

      "description": "The `corpus.md` overview states it was prepared for analysis using 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.0', while the experiment is using 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.4'.",
      "impact": "This is a minor version mismatch that is unlikely to cause execution failure but indicates the corpus documentation is slightly out of date. The corpus may not have been curated with the latest framework refinements in mind.",
