### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary, framework-driven analysis of rhetorical patterns within a corpus of seven presidential speeches delivered by a single speaker (Donald J. Trump) between 2017 and 2025. The analysis employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4, a computational methodology designed to quantify complex discourse dimensions. Given the small sample size (N=7), this study is exploratory in nature (Tier 3), and its findings should be interpreted as indicative patterns that warrant further investigation with a larger, more diverse dataset, rather than as conclusive results.

The central finding of this analysis is the identification of a consistent and sophisticated rhetorical strategy characterized by a dual-layered structure. The data reveal a stable and highly salient foundation built upon a "fragmentation cluster"—a tight, positive correlation between the rhetorical emphasis on `tribal_dominance` (ρ = 0.96 with `fear`; ρ = 0.89 with `enmity`), `fear`, and `enmity`. This suggests that appeals to in-group supremacy, crisis mentality, and adversarial positioning form the core of the communicative approach in the analyzed texts. Layered upon this foundation are significant, co-existing appeals to `hope` and `cohesive_goals`, creating measurable rhetorical tension and demonstrating a pattern of strategic contradiction, a phenomenon the CFF is specifically designed to measure.

Despite the presence of these cohesive elements, the framework's salience-weighted composite metrics consistently indicate a rhetorical balance tilted towards fragmentation. The mean `Full Cohesion Index`, the most comprehensive measure of discourse health within the CFF's deliberative democratic lens, was consistently negative (M = -0.17, SD = 0.05). Furthermore, an exploratory trend analysis suggests an intensification of this fragmenting emphasis over the 2017-2020 period. The analysis confirms the CFF's high utility for this type of corpus (Framework-Corpus Fit Score: 0.92), demonstrating its capacity to move beyond simplistic labels and provide nuanced, empirical data on complex political communication strategies.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This exploratory analysis yielded several preliminary insights into the rhetorical patterns of the corpus, as measured by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **A Dominant "Fragmentation Cluster" Forms the Rhetorical Core:** The analysis reveals a powerful and statistically robust positive correlation between the salience of `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity`. The correlation between the emphasis on `tribal_dominance` and `fear` is exceptionally strong (Spearman's ρ = 0.96). This suggests a coherent rhetorical strategy where appeals to in-group identity are intrinsically linked with messages of threat and hostility toward out-groups.
*   **Strategic Contradiction is a Consistent Feature:** The data show the simultaneous use of high-intensity fragmentative dimensions (e.g., `fear`, M = 0.87) and high-intensity cohesive dimensions (e.g., `hope`, M = 0.86). This pattern of employing opposing appeals is empirically captured by the `Strategic Contradiction Index` (M = 0.101), validating the CFF's theoretical premise that sophisticated discourse often contains competing messages.
*   **Salience-Weighted Analysis Reveals a Net Fragmentative Emphasis:** While cohesive themes are present, the framework's salience-weighted cohesion indices are consistently negative across all seven documents. The `Full Cohesion Index` ranged from -0.056 to -0.232 (M = -0.17), indicating that when rhetorical emphasis is accounted for, the discourse consistently prioritizes themes of division, threat, and conflict over those of unity, opportunity, and cooperation.
*   **A Potential Intensification of Fragmentative Rhetoric Over Time:** An exploratory trend analysis of the `Full Cohesion Index` from 2017 to 2025 suggests a pattern of increasing rhetorical fragmentation. The index value declined from -0.056 in the 2017 inaugural address to -0.227 in the 2020 State of the Union, a level maintained in the 2025 speeches. This preliminary finding points to a potential strategic shift that requires further study.
*   **The Framework Demonstrates Strong Construct Validity and Corpus Fit:** The CFF proved highly effective for this analysis. Opposing dimensions, such as `Envy` and `Mudita`, showed a strong negative correlation (ρ = -0.79), supporting the framework's theoretical structure. The overall Framework-Corpus Fit score was 0.92, indicating excellent discriminatory power and suitability for analyzing strategic political communication.
*   **Success Orientation is Skewed Towards Grievance:** The `Envy`/`Mudita` axis, which measures attitudes toward others' success, showed a clear imbalance. The mean score for `envy` (M = 0.66) was substantially higher than for `mudita` (M = 0.24), suggesting a rhetorical focus on resentment, zero-sum thinking, and grievance over celebrating merit or an abundance mindset.

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This analysis is grounded in the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4, a measurement methodology rooted in the deliberative democracy tradition (Gutmann & Thompson, 1996; Habermas, 1996). This tradition posits that the quality of public discourse is fundamental to democratic legitimacy and social cohesion. The CFF operationalizes this by quantifying rhetorical patterns that theoretical frameworks associate with discourse quality. Its core innovation is the independent scoring of conceptually opposing dimensions (e.g., `Fear` vs. `Hope`), a direct response to the information loss problem in traditional content analysis that forces artificial binary choices (Krippendorff, 2004).

The framework's dimensions are informed by established social science theories. The **Identity Axis** (`Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`) draws from Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999), which explain the dynamics of in-group favoritism and group-based hierarchies. The **Emotional Climate** axis (`Fear` vs. `Hope`) is informed by research on emotional appeals in political communication (Brader, 2006; Marcus et al., 2000), which demonstrates the influence of affect on political judgment. The **Relational Climate** axis (`Enmity` vs. `Amity`) connects to scholarship on political polarization and deliberative norms (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008).

A key feature of the CFF is its use of salience-weighting, where each dimension's score is multiplied by its rhetorical prominence. This approach is empirically justified by research showing that context-dependent weighting provides more accurate results than fixed schemes (Laver et al., 2003). The framework produces several derived metrics, most notably the **Cohesion Indices**, which provide a summative, salience-weighted measure of the discourse's balance between fragmenting and cohesive rhetoric. This study primarily interprets these indices through the CFF's default **Democratic Health Framework**, which views dimensions like `individual_dignity`, `hope`, and `amity` as positive indicators and `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity` as indicators of concern. However, the CFF specification acknowledges that alternative theoretical lenses, such as Competitive Politics or Agonistic Democracy (Mouffe, 2000), could lead to different interpretations of the same empirical data.

### 4. Methodology

This study conducted a framework-driven statistical analysis of a corpus of seven presidential speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. The objective was to explore the framework's performance and identify preliminary rhetorical patterns based solely on the generated quantitative data.

#### 4.1 Framework Description and Analytical Approach
The CFF measures discourse along ten dimensions, organized into five opposing pairs: Identity (`Tribal Dominance`/`Individual Dignity`), Emotional Climate (`Fear`/`Hope`), Success Orientation (`Envy`/`Mudita`), Relational Climate (`Enmity`/`Amity`), and Goal Orientation (`Fragmentative Goals`/`Cohesive Goals`). For each dimension, the analysis generates two scores: `raw_score` (intensity, 0.0-1.0) and `salience` (rhetorical prominence, 0.0-1.0). From these, derived metrics are calculated, including Tension Indices, a Strategic Contradiction Index, and three salience-weighted Cohesion Indices (Descriptive, Motivational, Full) that range from -1.0 (maximally fragmenting) to +1.0 (maximally cohesive).

#### 4.2 Data Structure and Corpus Description
The dataset consists of CFF v10.4 analysis results for seven public speeches delivered by Donald J. Trump. The corpus includes one inaugural address (2017), five State of the Union addresses (2017-2020, 2025), and one memorial speech (2025). This selection provides temporal coverage and includes different formal presidential communication contexts.

#### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints
Given the small sample size (N=7), this study is classified as a **Tier 3 (Exploratory) analysis**. The statistical approach was chosen to reflect this limitation, prioritizing descriptive statistics and effect sizes over inferential claims.
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Means (M), standard deviations (SD), medians, and ranges were calculated for all dimensional scores and derived metrics to describe central tendency and dispersion.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Non-parametric Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation (rho, ρ) was used to assess monotonic relationships between variables. This method is more robust for small sample sizes and does not assume a linear relationship, making it appropriate for this exploratory context.
*   **Group Comparison:** Comparisons between speech types were limited to descriptive summaries of means, as the small and unequal group sizes (e.g., N=1 for inaugural) preclude valid inferential testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA).
*   **Claim Strength:** All analytical claims are presented as preliminary, suggestive, or indicative. The low statistical power inherent in a small sample size means that the absence of a statistically significant finding cannot be interpreted as the absence of an effect. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and generating hypotheses for future, well-powered research. All numerical results are reported with precision consistent with APA 7th edition standards.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

#### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics for the ten core CFF dimensions reveal a distinct rhetorical profile for the corpus. As shown in Table 1, the fragmentative dimensions of `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity`, along with `fragmentative_goals`, exhibit high mean intensity and salience scores coupled with low standard deviations. This indicates they are a consistent and dominant feature of the discourse. Conversely, cohesive dimensions like `hope` and `cohesive_goals` also score consistently high, pointing to the simultaneous use of opposing appeals. Other cohesive dimensions, such as `individual_dignity` and `mudita`, have lower mean scores and higher variability, suggesting their application is more context-dependent.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Dimensional Scores and Salience (N=7)**
| Dimension | Mean Score | SD Score | Mean Salience | SD Salience |
| :---------------------- | :--------: | :------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| **Fragmentative Axis** | | | | |
| tribal_dominance | 0.85 | 0.05 | 0.85 | 0.06 |
| fear | 0.87 | 0.05 | 0.88 | 0.05 |
| envy | 0.66 | 0.23 | 0.59 | 0.27 |
| enmity | 0.87 | 0.09 | 0.82 | 0.11 |
| fragmentative_goals | 0.76 | 0.05 | 0.73 | 0.06 |
| **Cohesive Axis** | | | | |
| individual_dignity | 0.41 | 0.28 | 0.32 | 0.25 |
| hope | 0.86 | 0.08 | 0.84 | 0.10 |
| mudita | 0.24 | 0.26 | 0.22 | 0.30 |
| amity | 0.69 | 0.24 | 0.64 | 0.27 |
| cohesive_goals | 0.86 | 0.08 | 0.85 | 0.08 |

#### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a higher-level view of the discourse's strategic structure. Table 2 summarizes the key indices. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` (M = 0.101) is consistently in the low-to-moderate range, providing empirical evidence for the CFF's premise that political discourse often involves the strategic co-deployment of contradictory appeals.

Most significantly, all three Cohesion Indices show consistently negative mean values. The `Full Cohesion Index`, which incorporates all ten dimensions, has a mean of -0.17. Interpreted through the CFF's default *Democratic Health* lens, this negative balance indicates that the salience-weighted rhetorical emphasis of the speeches leans more heavily toward patterns associated with social fragmentation (`Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Enmity`) than those associated with social cohesion (`Individual Dignity`, `Hope`, `Amity`).

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Derived Metrics (N=7)**
| Derived Metric | Mean | SD | Median | Min | Max |
| :-------------------------------- | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Strategic Contradiction Index | 0.101 | 0.026 | 0.114 | 0.064 | 0.134 |
| Descriptive Cohesion Index | -0.170 | 0.060 | -0.148 | -0.269 | -0.108 |
| Motivational Cohesion Index | -0.090 | 0.050 | -0.073 | -0.175 | -0.030 |
| Full Cohesion Index | -0.170 | 0.050 | -0.171 | -0.232 | -0.056 |

#### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

Spearman's rank-order correlation was used to explore relationships between CFF dimensions, revealing the underlying structure of the rhetorical strategy.

##### 5.3.1 Construct Validity of Opposing Dimensions
As shown in Table 3, the analysis of raw scores for opposing dimensional pairs generally shows the expected negative relationships, which serves as a preliminary validation of the framework's construct validity. The strongest opposition was observed between `Envy` and `Mudita` (ρ = -0.79), suggesting that as rhetoric of grievance increases, rhetoric celebrating others' success systematically decreases. The weakest opposition was between `Fragmentative Goals` and `Cohesive Goals` (ρ = -0.39), indicating that speakers in this corpus were most able to advance both types of goals simultaneously without a direct trade-off.

**Table 3: Spearman's Rho Correlations Between Opposing Raw Score Dimensions**
| Paired Dimensions | Spearman's rho (ρ) |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------: |
| Envy vs. Mudita | -0.79 |
| Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity | -0.64 |
| Enmity vs. Amity | -0.61 |
| Fear vs. Hope | -0.55 |
| Fragmentative vs. Cohesive Goals | -0.39 |

##### 5.3.2 Identification of Rhetorical Clusters
Analysis of the correlations between the *salience* scores of different dimensions reveals two distinct rhetorical clusters (Table 4). A powerful "fragmentation cluster" emerges from the very strong, positive correlations between the emphasis placed on `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity`. This suggests a coherent meta-strategy where these three appeals are deployed in concert. A corresponding, though less statistically dominant, "cohesion cluster" is suggested by the strong positive correlation between the salience of `individual_dignity` and `amity`. The strong negative correlation between the salience of `tribal_dominance` and `individual_dignity` (ρ = -0.68) highlights a direct rhetorical competition for emphasis between these two opposing identity frames.

**Table 4: Selected Spearman's Rho Correlations Between Dimension Salience Scores**
| Dimension 1 Salience | Dimension 2 Salience | Spearman's rho (ρ) |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------- | :----------------: |
| **tribal_dominance** | **fear** | **0.96** |
| **tribal_dominance** | **enmity** | **0.89** |
| **fear** | **enmity** | **0.75** |
| **individual_dignity** | **amity** | **0.75** |
| **tribal_dominance** | **individual_dignity** | -0.68 |

#### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns suggest a clear temporal trend. As displayed in Table 5, all three cohesion indices show a general decline toward more negative values over the 2017-2020 period. The `Full Cohesion Index` for the 2017 inaugural address was -0.056, whereas the index for the 2020 State of the Union was -0.227. The scores for the 2025 speeches remain in this highly negative range. This exploratory finding suggests a possible intensification of the salience-weighted fragmentative rhetoric over time. While this trend is visually apparent, the small number of data points means this should be treated as a hypothesis for future, more extensive longitudinal research.

**Table 5: Exploratory Trend of Cohesion Indices Over Time (2017-2025)**
| Year | Speech Type | Descriptive Cohesion | Motivational Cohesion | Full Cohesion |
| :--- | :--------------- | :------------------: | :-------------------: | :-----------: |
| 2017 | inaugural | -0.118 | -0.044 | **-0.056** |
| 2017 | state_of_union | -0.148 | -0.040 | **-0.133** |
| 2018 | state_of_union | -0.108 | -0.030 | **-0.129** |
| 2019 | state_of_union | -0.137 | -0.073 | **-0.171** |
| 2020 | state_of_union | -0.269 | -0.175 | **-0.227** |
| 2025 | state_of_union | -0.247 | -0.127 | **-0.232** |
| 2025 | memorial | -0.185 | -0.137 | **-0.227** |

#### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CFF demonstrated high effectiveness in analyzing this corpus, validating its methodological design for capturing complex political rhetoric.

*   **Discriminatory Power Analysis:** The framework's dimensions showed varied levels of variance. Dimensions like `individual_dignity` (Score Variance = 0.076), `envy` (0.052), `mudita` (0.067), and `amity` (0.058) exhibited excellent variance, indicating they were highly effective at discriminating between the rhetorical nuances of the different speeches. Conversely, dimensions like `tribal_dominance` (0.003), `fear` (0.003), and `fragmentative_goals` (0.003) showed low variance because they were consistently scored high across the corpus, identifying them as stable, foundational elements of this specific rhetorical style rather than points of variation within it.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation:** The statistical agent calculated an overall **Framework-Corpus Fit Score of 0.92**, indicating a strong to excellent match. This high score is justified by three factors: (1) **High Suitability**, as the corpus of formal presidential speeches is the ideal type of strategic communication the CFF is designed to analyze; (2) **Good Discriminatory Power**, as evidenced by the high variance in several key dimensions; and (3) **Strong Theoretical Alignment**, as the observed statistical patterns (e.g., negative correlations between opposing dimensions, clustering of related dimensions) align well with the framework's theoretical underpinnings. This score suggests the results are a valid representation of the corpus's features as defined by the CFF.

### 6. Discussion

This exploratory study, despite its sample size limitations, offers significant preliminary insights into both the rhetorical strategy present in the corpus and the utility of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework. The primary theoretical implication is the empirical identification of a multi-layered rhetorical structure. The data suggest a strategy that does not rely on a single emotional or ideological appeal but rather on a stable base of fragmenting rhetoric (the `tribal_dominance`-`fear`-`enmity` cluster) that creates a sense of crisis and in-group/out-group conflict. This foundation appears to create the rhetorical space for the simultaneous deployment of cohesive appeals (`hope`, `amity`, `cohesive_goals`), which may function to broaden the message's appeal or to frame the speaker as the solution to the articulated crisis.

This finding challenges unidimensional models of political discourse that might label a speech as simply "populist" or "unifying." The CFF's ability to measure `Strategic Contradiction` (M=0.101) and produce salience-weighted indices (e.g., `Full Cohesion Index`, M=-0.17) provides a more nuanced, data-driven picture. It suggests that the cohesive elements, while present and intense, are not given the same rhetorical emphasis as the fragmenting ones, resulting in a net negative balance. The potential trend of this negative balance intensifying over time is a critical hypothesis generated by this pilot study, suggesting a possible evolution in strategy that prioritizes mobilization through conflict-oriented frames.

The broader significance for the field of computational social science lies in the validation of the CFF's methodological approach. The framework's success in identifying theoretically consistent patterns (e.g., the fragmentation cluster) in a very small dataset speaks to its sensitivity and analytical power. It demonstrates that a well-designed, theory-informed framework can extract meaningful, quantitative signals from complex, qualitative data.

The primary limitation is the N=7 sample, which is drawn from a single speaker. The findings are therefore descriptive of this specific corpus and cannot be generalized to presidential discourse as a whole, nor to other speakers or political contexts. The observed trends are suggestive and require a much larger longitudinal dataset to be confirmed. Future research should apply the CFF to a diverse corpus including different speakers, parties, and time periods to test the generalizability of the identified "fragmentation cluster" and the dual-layered rhetorical strategy.

### 7. Conclusion

This report detailed an exploratory statistical analysis of seven presidential speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.4. The analysis successfully demonstrated the framework's capacity to generate nuanced, quantitative insights into complex rhetorical strategies. The key contribution is the empirical characterization of a dual-layered communicative approach within the corpus, defined by a foundational "fragmentation cluster" of tribalism, fear, and enmity, which is strategically combined with cohesive appeals.

Methodologically, the study serves as a successful proof-of-concept for the CFF. The framework's constructs behaved as theoretically expected, with opposing dimensions showing negative correlations and related dimensions clustering together. The high Framework-Corpus Fit score (0.92) confirms its suitability for analyzing strategic political communication.

The research implications are primarily generative. This pilot study produces a clear, data-driven hypothesis for future, well-powered research: that a prevalent strategy in this form of political discourse involves leveraging a highly salient, fragmenting core message while tactically employing cohesive language, with a potential trend toward intensifying the fragmenting emphasis over time. By moving beyond simple categorical analysis, this framework-driven approach provides a robust empirical basis for the future study of discourse and its relationship to social cohesion.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The statistical analysis was conducted on a dataset (N=7) generated by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. Due to the small sample size, the analysis was designated as **Tier 3 (Exploratory)**, prioritizing descriptive statistics and non-parametric methods. Central tendency and dispersion (mean, median, standard deviation) were calculated for the ten primary CFF dimensions (both intensity and salience scores) and for derived metrics, including the Strategic Contradiction Index and three Cohesion Indices (Descriptive, Motivational, Full). To assess relationships between variables, Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation (rho) was employed, as it is suitable for small sample sizes and does not assume linear relationships. Group comparisons by speech type were limited to descriptive summaries of means due to insufficient power for inferential tests. A Framework-Corpus Fit score was calculated based on dimensional variance, corpus suitability, and the alignment of observed statistical patterns with the framework's theoretical expectations. All analytical claims were framed as preliminary and suggestive, in accordance with the exploratory nature of the study.
