      "description": "The narrative section of the experiment specification describes a 6-document corpus, omitting `Trump_SOTU_2019.txt` and `trump_kirk_funeral_2025.txt`. However, the experiment's machine-readable appendix correctly specifies `sample_size: 7`, and the `corpus.md` manifest lists 7 documents.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency could cause confusion for human researchers reviewing the experiment design. The platform will execute the analysis on all 7 documents from the corpus, ignoring the incorrect narrative description.",
      "fix": "Update the Abstract and \"Corpus Design\" sections in `experiment.md` to accurately reflect the 7 documents present in the `corpus.md` manifest.",

      "description": "The experiment has a sample size of N=7. While this is sufficient for the designated `analysis_type: \"case_study\"` and for generating descriptive statistics, it is insufficient for robust inferential statistical analyses like factorial ANOVA, which is alluded to by the mention of \"Factorial Design Validation\".",
      "impact": "The results of any formal inferential statistical tests would have very low power and should be interpreted with extreme caution. The primary value will be in descriptive and case-study insights, as correctly specified by the `analysis_type`. This does not block execution.",
      "fix": "Acknowledge the statistical limitations in the experiment's 'Expected Outcomes' or 'Methodology' sections. Reframe analysis goals to focus on descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and qualitative case-study comparisons rather than formal hypothesis testing. For robust inferential statistics, a larger corpus would be required (e.g., N>30).",
