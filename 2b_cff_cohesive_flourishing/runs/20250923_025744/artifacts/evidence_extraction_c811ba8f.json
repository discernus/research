From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.\",\n  \"Thanks to our America First policies we\u2019re putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks.\",\n  \"We\u2019ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.\",\n  \"And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.\",\n  \"I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country.\",\n  \"In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country.\",\n  \"Last year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley... was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden\u2019s open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration.\",\n  \"America\u2019s momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back. And the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.\",\n  \"This is a time for big dreams and bold action.\",\n  \"With God\u2019s help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.\",\n  \"Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying.\",\n  \"Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it\u2019s our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada... charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It\u2019s very unfair.\",\n  \"We\u2019ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada... they\u2019ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families.\",\n  \"None\",\n  \"In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country.\",\n  \"We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me.\",\n  \"All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken\u2019s murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations.\",\n  \"So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let\u2019s work together and let\u2019s truly make America great again.\",\n  \"If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.\",\n  \"I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country.\",\n  \"We\u2019ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.\",\n  \"I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women\u2019s sports... schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding.\"\n]\n```",
