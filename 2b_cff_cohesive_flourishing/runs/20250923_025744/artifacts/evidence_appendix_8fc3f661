**Curated Evidence:**

1.  **Document Index:** 6
    **Exact Quote Text:** "I'm not here to fight them. I want to know them and love them, and I want to reach them and try and lead them into a great way of life in our country.' In that private moment on his dying day, we find everything we need to know about who Charlie Kirk truly was. He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry."
    **Statistical Relevance:** This quote provides **direct and explicit evidence for balanced contradiction on the Relational Axis (enmity vs. amity)**, showcasing the speaker's personal admission of hatred ("I hate my opponent") immediately following a description of Charlie Kirk's amity ("He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them"). It also highlights **rhetorical tension on the Identity Axis (tribal_dominance vs. individual_dignity)**, as the speaker's tribalistic hatred directly contrasts with Kirk's more universalist, dignified approach. This passage is crucial for explaining the **negative full_cohesion_index** by demonstrating how overt enmity can undermine cohesive appeals.

    **Exact Quote Text:** "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country."
    **Statistical Relevance:** This quote exemplifies **high-intensity appeals to fragmentation (tribal_dominance, fear, enmity)**. It demonizes a political opponent ("worst president"), an out-group ("murderers, drug dealers, gang members, people from mental institutions"), and evokes strong fear ("released into our country"). This strong "us vs. them" framing and the explicit threat to the in-group are key pieces of **evidence explaining the negative full_cohesion_index**.

3.  **Document Index:** 5
    **Exact Quote Text:** "Last year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley... was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden’s open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration."
    **Statistical Relevance:** This passage is a powerful example of **high-intensity appeals to fragmentation (fear, enmity, tribal_dominance)**. It uses a specific, tragic narrative to evoke fear ("horrifically murdered"), demonize an out-group ("savage illegal alien gang member"), and blame a political opponent ("heartless policies of that failed administration"). The phrase "stolen from us" reinforces in-group victimhood and **tribal_dominance**, directly contributing to the **negative full_cohesion_index**.

    **Exact Quote Text:** "We've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay."
    **Statistical Relevance:** This quote provides strong **evidence explaining the negative full_cohesion_index** by illustrating how **tribal_dominance** (prioritizing "American industry," "our military," "our own borders") is framed against an out-group ("foreign industry," "other countries," "other nations' borders"). It uses **enmity** ("at the expense of," "refusing to defend our own") to highlight perceived injustices and resource drain, fostering fragmentation.

5.  **Document Index:** 4
    **Exact Quote Text:** "Tonight I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards."
    **Statistical Relevance:** This quote demonstrates **high-intensity appeals to fragmentation (fear, enmity, tribal_dominance)** and directly addresses the **rhetorical tension on the Identity Axis**. It frames border defense as an act of "love and devotion" to the in-group ("fellow citizens," "our country") while simultaneously creating an internal "us vs. them" divide between "America's working class" and "America's political class." The accusation of hypocrisy ("living their lives behind walls") fuels **enmity** and reinforces **tribal_dominance**, explaining the **negative full_cohesion_index**.

    **Exact Quote Text:** "We’ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada... they’ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families."
    **Statistical Relevance:** This quote powerfully combines **high-intensity appeals to fragmentation (enmity, fear, tribal_dominance)**. It uses strong **enmity** ("ripped off," "allowed fentanyl") against foreign nations and evokes intense **fear** ("killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens," "destroying families"). The focus on protecting "our citizens" from external threats is a clear manifestation of **tribal_dominance**, directly contributing to the **negative full_cohesion_index**.

It uses an "us vs. them" narrative, contrasting defending "other nations" with neglecting "our own borders." The imagery of "drugs to pour in at an unprecedented rate" evokes **fear** and **enmity**, serving as strong **evidence explaining the negative full_cohesion_index** by portraying the in-group as vulnerable due to external threats and internal failures.

    **Exact Quote Text:** "[For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.]"
    **Statistical Relevance:** This quote is a prime example of **high-intensity appeals to fragmentation (fear, enmity, tribal_dominance)**. It evokes **fear** ("drugs and gangs," "loss of many innocent lives"), creates **enmity** against "low-wage workers" who "compete against the poorest Americans," and reinforces **tribal_dominance** by focusing on "our most vulnerable communities" and "poorest Americans." This directly explains the **negative full_cohesion_index** by framing immigration as a direct threat to the in-group.

The use of "invasion" evokes strong **fear** and **enmity** against those crossing the border, while the deployment of military forces to "repel" them underscores a defensive, **tribal_dominance** posture.

It frames DEI policies as a "tyranny," creating **enmity** against an ideological out-group ("woke"). The declaration that "our country will be woke no longer" is a strong assertion of **tribal_dominance**, defining the in-group's identity by rejecting an opposing ideology, which explains the **negative full_cohesion_index**.

    **Exact Quote Text:** "All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken’s murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations."
    **Statistical Relevance:** This quote is a powerful example of **high-intensity appeals to fragmentation (enmity, fear, tribal_dominance)**. It uses dehumanizing language ("savages," "bloodthirsty") and evokes **fear** through association with "murders" and "toughest gang." The official designation as "foreign terrorist organizations" reinforces the **tribal_dominance** narrative of identifying and combating external threats, directly contributing to the **negative full_cohesion_index**.

    **Exact Quote Text:** "One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery."
    **Statistical Relevance:** This quote demonstrates the **co-occurrence of fragmentation appeals (fear, enmity) and cohesion appeals (individual_dignity)**, but framed within a context of **tribal_dominance**. It evokes strong **fear** ("sexually assaulted," "slavery") and **enmity** ("smugglers," "traffickers"). While it appeals to **individual_dignity** by highlighting the suffering of women and children, this is used to justify stricter border control and protect "our laws" and "our country," thus reinforcing **tribal_dominance** and contributing to the **negative full_cohesion_index**.
