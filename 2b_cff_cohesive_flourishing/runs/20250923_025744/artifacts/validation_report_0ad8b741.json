      "description": "The corpus includes a 'memorial' speech ('trump_kirk_funeral_2025.txt'), while the framework's 'Intended Application & Corpus Fit' section states it is designed for 'persuasive or strategic communication' and is 'less suited for' other genres. The rhetorical structure of a memorial speech may differ significantly from political addresses like the SOTU or Inaugural.",
      "impact": "Including a document that may not fit the framework's ideal profile could lower the overall framework-corpus fit score and may complicate direct comparisons of analytical results between the memorial speech and the strategic political speeches.",
      "fix": "Acknowledge this potential genre mismatch in the analysis. Consider either analyzing the memorial speech separately or explicitly justifying its inclusion as a comparative case of rhetoric in a different context.",

    "The experiment is correctly identified as a 'case_study' given the sample size of N=7. This allows for qualitative pattern analysis and descriptive statistics but is insufficient for robust inferential statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA). This approach is sound and compliant with platform guidelines."
