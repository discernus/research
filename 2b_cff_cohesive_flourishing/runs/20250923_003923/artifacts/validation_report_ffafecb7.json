      "description": "The experiment's human-readable description of the corpus is inconsistent with the corpus manifest and the experiment's own machine-readable metadata. The abstract mentions '6 presidential speeches' and the 'Corpus Design' section details only 5. However, the experiment's 'sample_size' metadata is 7, and the corpus manifest correctly lists 7 documents.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency can confuse human readers about the scope and composition of the experiment, potentially leading to misinterpretation of the results. The machine execution will proceed with 7 documents, but the research documentation is inaccurate.",
      "fix": "Update the abstract and 'Corpus Design' section in 'experiment.md' to accurately reflect the corpus size of 7 documents. Ensure all 7 documents from 'corpus.md' are listed and described.",

      "impact": "A strict, spec-compliant parser may fail to locate the derived metric definitions, which would prevent the calculation of all tension and cohesion indices. While a lenient system might find it, it violates the specification.",

      "description": "The experiment's sample size is small (N=7). While appropriate for the specified 'case_study' analysis type, robust inferential statistical conclusions (e.g., from ANOVA or t-tests) would be underpowered. The planned analyses like 'temporal pattern analysis' and 'speech context analysis' are suitable, but should be interpreted as descriptive or exploratory.",
      "impact": "Overstating the statistical significance of findings could lead to invalid conclusions. The current setup is valid for generating qualitative insights and descriptive patterns.",
      "fix": "No fix is required to run the experiment. However, it is recommended to explicitly state in the research write-up that the small sample size limits the analysis to descriptive statistics and qualitative pattern identification, and that any observed differences should be interpreted with caution.",
