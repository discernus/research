**Curated Evidence for Rhetorical Divergence (2017 vs. 2025 SOTU)**

**2017 SOTU (Index 1)**

1.  **Document index:** 1
    **Exact quote text:** "Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms."
    **Statistical relevance:** Shift Towards Fragmentation (contrast: 2017 shows less fragmentation by explicitly calling for unity despite policy divisions); Erosion of Bridging Rhetoric (contrast: 2017 demonstrates Amity/Dignity by emphasizing shared condemnation of hate).
    **Strength rating:** 5

2.  **Document index:** 1
    **Exact quote text:** "True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future."

    **Strength rating:** 5

3.  **Document index:** 1
    **Exact quote text:** "We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is—division. It's pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify."
    **Statistical relevance:** Shift Towards Fragmentation (contrast: 2017 explicitly advocates for unity and against division, using the metaphor of "building bridges"); Erosion of Bridging Rhetoric (contrast: 2017 demonstrates Amity by calling for cooperation and trust).
    **Strength rating:** 5

4.  **Document index:** 2
    **Exact quote text:** "On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people."
    **Statistical relevance:** Shift Towards Fragmentation (contrast: 2017 makes a direct appeal for bipartisan unity); Erosion of Bridging Rhetoric (contrast: 2017 exemplifies Amity by urging political opponents to "get together and unite").
    **Strength rating:** 5

5.  **Document index:** 1
    **Exact quote text:** "I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart."

    **Strength rating:** 4

6.  **Document index:** 2
    **Exact quote text:** "Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope."
    **Statistical relevance:** Shift Towards Fragmentation (contrast: 2017 offers an inclusive, optimistic vision of collective healing and problem-solving, reducing fragmentation); Erosion of Bridging Rhetoric (contrast: 2017 shows Individual Dignity by addressing "every hurting family").
    **Strength rating:** 4

7.  **Document index:** 2
    **Exact quote text:** "America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found."

    **Strength rating:** 4

9.  **Document index:** 2
    **Exact quote text:** "My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America."
    **Statistical relevance:** Increased Rhetorical Consistency (contrast: 2017 shows higher strategic contradiction, as this "America First" stance can conflict with broader appeals to global cooperation or even internal unity if it implies a zero-sum game).
