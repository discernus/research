### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary, data-driven analysis of rhetorical patterns within a pilot sample of presidential discourse, utilizing the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. The analysis is strictly a quantitative comparison of two State of the Union (SOTU) addresses from 2017 and 2025 (N=2). Due to the extremely limited sample size, this study is exploratory in nature; its findings describe specific differences between these two documents and are not generalizable. All claims are presented as suggestive patterns requiring further investigation with a larger dataset.

The central finding of this analysis is the documentation of a significant and measurable evolution in rhetorical strategy between the two observed time points. The data indicates a shift from a complex, internally contradictory rhetorical posture in 2017 to a more coherent but starkly more fragmentative and adversarial strategy in 2025. This transformation is most clearly captured by the **Full Cohesion Index**, a comprehensive measure of discourse orientation, which declined sharply from a near-neutral value of -0.060 in 2017 to a strongly negative value of -0.371 in 2025. This suggests a move away from discourse that, however weakly, gestures towards social solidarity and towards discourse that is quantitatively measured as promoting fragmentation. For instance, in 2017, the President explicitly called for unity, stating: "We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is—division. It's pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify." (Source: 2017 SOTU). This contrasts sharply with the 2025 address, where the President declared: "I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry." (Source: 2025 SOTU), exemplifying the pronounced shift towards explicit enmity.

This shift is underpinned by a structural change in the use of competing appeals. The 2017 address balanced high levels of both `Enmity` (hostility) and `Amity` (friendship), a classic strategy of identifying enemies while calling for unity. In contrast, the 2025 address shows a near-total collapse of cohesive language: `Amity` scores dropped by 87.5% (0.80 to 0.10) and `Individual Dignity` (universal human worth) scores were eliminated entirely (0.40 to 0.00). Concurrently, fragmentative dimensions such as `Enmity`, `Envy`, and `Fragmentative Goals` intensified. Paradoxically, this more divisive rhetoric was also more internally consistent, as the **Strategic Contradiction Index** decreased from 0.120 to 0.042. This suggests the abandonment of mixed messaging in favor of a more focused, albeit polarizing, rhetorical framework. While preliminary, these findings demonstrate the CFF's capacity to quantify nuanced shifts in political communication strategy.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Marked Shift Towards Rhetorical Fragmentation:** The most significant finding is the dramatic decline across all three composite cohesion indices. The **Full Cohesion Index**, the framework's most comprehensive metric, fell from -0.060 to -0.371, indicating a substantial move from a rhetorically mixed message to one that is strongly oriented towards fragmentation according to the framework's measurement criteria. This is evident when comparing the 2017 call for collective advancement, as the President stated: "True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future." (Source: 2017 SOTU), with the 2025 rhetoric that demonizes political opponents and immigrants, as seen when the President claimed: "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country." (Source: 2025 SOTU).

*   **Collapse of Bridging and Unifying Rhetoric:** The data reveals a near-complete erosion of language associated with social cohesion between the two speeches. The raw score for `Amity` (friendship appeals) plummeted from 0.80 to 0.10, while its rhetorical `salience` fell from 0.70 to 0.05. Similarly, `Individual Dignity` (universal human worth) was present in 2017 (score: 0.40) but absent in 2025 (score: 0.00). In 2017, the President appealed for bipartisan cooperation, stating: "On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people." (Source: 2017 SOTU). Furthermore, the 2017 address emphasized universal well-being, as the President noted: "Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job." (Source: 2017 SOTU). This inclusive language stands in stark contrast to the explicit rejection of amity in 2025, where the President unapologetically declared: "I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry." (Source: 2025 SOTU).

*   **Intensification of Adversarial and Grievance-Based Appeals:** The decline in cohesive language was met with a corresponding intensification of fragmentative themes. The raw score for `Enmity` (hostility) increased from 0.80 to 0.95, `Envy` (resentment) rose from 0.60 to 0.75, and `Fragmentative Goals` (divisive objectives) jumped from 0.60 to 0.90. This suggests a strategic pivot towards a more adversarial and zero-sum worldview. The 2025 speech frequently demonized opponents, with the President stating: "Every single American should take a long, hard look at the twisted soul and dark spirit of anyone who would want to kill a young man as good as Charlie..." (Source: 2025 SOTU). This was further amplified by portraying political adversaries as threats, as when the President mentioned: "The Department of Justice is also investigating networks of radical left maniacs who fund organized fuel and perpetrate political violence." (Source: 2025 SOTU). International relations were also framed through a lens of grievance and blame, with the President asserting: "We’ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada... they’ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families." (Source: 2025 SOTU).

*   **Increased Rhetorical Coherence Through Polarization:** Counterintuitively, the more divisive 2025 speech was more rhetorically consistent. The **Strategic Contradiction Index**, which measures the use of competing appeals, decreased from 0.120 to 0.042. This indicates the 2017 speech's strategy of balancing cohesive and divisive messages was replaced by a more uniform, less contradictory, and thus more singularly polarizing rhetorical approach in 2025. While the 2017 speech contained elements of `Enmity` alongside calls for unity, as when the President stated: "I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer." (Source: 2017 SOTU), the 2025 address demonstrated a consistent, ideologically aligned policy direction, with the President listing actions such as: "Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying." (Source: 2025 SOTU).

*   **Sustained High Levels of Exclusionary Identity:** The `Tribal Dominance` dimension, measuring in-group supremacy rhetoric, remained at a maximum intensity of 0.90 in both speeches. However, the disappearance of the countervailing `Individual Dignity` dimension in 2025 suggests a shift from a mixed identity frame to a purely exclusionary one. In 2017, the President articulated a nationalistic stance, stating: "My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America." (Source: 2017 SOTU). By 2025, this exclusionary identity was reinforced through the creation of highly partisan hero narratives, as the President declared: "He's a martyr now for American freedom. I know I speak for everyone here today when I say that none of us will ever forget Charlie Kirk and neither now will history because while Charlie has been reunited with his creator in heaven his voice on earth will echo through the generations and his name will live forever in the eternal chronicle of America's greatest patriots, he will live forever." (Source: 2025 SOTU).

*   **Framework's Discriminatory Utility:** Despite the severe data limitations, the CFF demonstrated its capacity to generate discriminating measurements. The framework detected an average absolute difference of 0.205 across the ten primary dimensions, successfully quantifying the substantial rhetorical divergence between the two documents.

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) is grounded in established theories of political communication, social psychology, and democratic theory. Its findings can be interpreted through several theoretical lenses, primarily the deliberative democracy tradition (Gutmann & Thompson, 1996; Habermas, 1996), which posits that discourse quality is fundamental to democratic legitimacy. From this perspective, positive scores on dimensions like `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals` are indicators of healthy democratic discourse, while high scores on `Tribal Dominance`, `Enmity`, and `Fragmentative Goals` are cause for concern.

The framework's Identity Axis (`Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`) is explicitly rooted in Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). These theories explain how group-based hierarchies and in-group/out-group dynamics are constructed and maintained through communication. The observed data, showing consistently high `Tribal Dominance` but a disappearance of `Individual Dignity`, provides a quantitative illustration of a rhetorical shift towards reinforcing social categorization and out-group distinction, a core concept in this literature. The collapse of `Individual Dignity` rhetoric signifies a move away from appeals to a superordinate "human" identity, which Brewer (1999) suggests is key to mitigating intergroup conflict.

Furthermore, the framework's measurement of `Enmity` and `Amity` relates to research on political polarization (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008). The observed shift from a state of high tension between `Enmity` and `Amity` in 2017 to one of dominant `Enmity` in 2025 can be interpreted as a move from a rhetorical strategy that acknowledges conflict while calling for unity, to one that centers conflict as the primary relational mode. The framework's novel contribution is its ability to quantify this structural shift, moving beyond a simple "more negative" assessment to show *how* the relationship between opposing appeals has been reconfigured. The decrease in the `Strategic Contradiction Index` alongside the increase in fragmentation provides empirical data for analyzing the coherence and focus of polarizing communication strategies.

### 4. Methodology

#### 4.1 Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4, a computational discourse analysis methodology designed to quantify rhetorical patterns in persuasive texts. The CFF's core innovation is its independent measurement of ten conceptual dimensions organized into five opposing pairs: Identity (Tribal Dominance/Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear/Hope), Success Orientation (Envy/Mudita), Relational Climate (Enmity/Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative/Cohesive Goals). For each dimension, the framework assesses both `raw_score` (intensity, 0.0-1.0) and `salience` (rhetorical prominence, 0.0-1.0), allowing for a nuanced analysis of not only what is said but how much it is emphasized.

The framework calculates several derived metrics. **Tension Indices** quantify the degree of strategic contradiction within each dimensional pair. These are aggregated into a **Strategic Contradiction Index**, which measures the overall rhetorical coherence of a text. Finally, three salience-weighted **Cohesion Indices** (Descriptive, Motivational, Full) provide composite scores ranging from -1.0 (fragmentative) to +1.0 (cohesive), offering a holistic evaluation of the discourse's orientation.

#### 4.2 Data Structure and Corpus Description

The source corpus for this experiment consists of seven presidential speeches from 2017-2025. However, the statistical analysis provided for this report was conducted on a pilot subset of only two documents (N=2): the 2017 State of the Union (SOTU) address and the 2025 SOTU address. This corpus of persuasive political speeches represents an ideal application for the CFF, which is designed to analyze strategic communication in political contexts.

#### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis is severely constrained by the sample size of N=2. This limitation precludes the use of any standard inferential or descriptive statistical methods, such as t-tests, correlation analysis (e.g., Pearson's r, Spearman's rho), or the calculation of meaningful measures of central tendency and dispersion (e.g., means, standard deviations) for the corpus.

Consequently, the analytical method employed is a **direct quantitative comparison**. The CFF scores (raw scores, salience, and all derived metrics) for the 2017 document were compared directly to the scores for the 2025 document. The "Change" column in the results table represents a simple arithmetic difference between the two data points. All interpretations are therefore confined to describing the observed differences between these two specific texts and are explicitly positioned as exploratory and preliminary. No claims of statistical significance or generalizability are made.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

#### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

No formal hypotheses (e.g., H₁, H₂) were specified in the experiment configuration. The analysis was conducted as an exploratory pilot study to assess the CFF's performance and identify potential patterns in the data worthy of future investigation.

#### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics

The following table presents a direct comparison of the CFF metrics for the two analyzed documents. Given the sample size of N=2, standard descriptive statistics (mean, SD) and significance indicators are not applicable. The "Change" column is provided to highlight the magnitude and direction of difference between the two speeches. All numerical values are reported to three decimal places, consistent with APA 7th edition standards for precision.

| Metric Type | Dimension / Index | 2017 SOTU (Index 1) | 2025 SOTU (Index 5) | Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Raw Score** | **Tribal Dominance** | 0.900 | 0.900 | 0.000 |
| | **Individual Dignity** | 0.400 | 0.000 | **-0.400** |
| | **Fear** | 0.800 | 0.900 | +0.100 |
| | **Hope** | 0.900 | 0.950 | +0.050 |
| | **Envy** | 0.600 | 0.750 | +0.150 |
| | **Mudita** | 0.100 | 0.000 | -0.100 |
| | **Enmity** | 0.800 | 0.950 | +0.150 |
| | **Amity** | 0.800 | 0.100 | **-0.700** |
| | **Fragmentative Goals** | 0.600 | 0.900 | **+0.300** |
| | **Cohesive Goals** | 0.900 | 0.800 | -0.100 |
| **Salience** | **Tribal Dominance** | 0.950 | 0.900 | -0.050 |
| | **Individual Dignity** | 0.300 | 0.000 | -0.300 |
| | **Fear** | 0.750 | 0.900 | +0.150 |
| | **Hope** | 0.900 | 0.950 | +0.050 |
| | **Envy** | 0.500 | 0.700 | +0.200 |
| | **Mudita** | 0.100 | 0.000 | -0.100 |
| | **Enmity** | 0.700 | 0.900 | +0.200 |
| | **Amity** | 0.700 | 0.050 | **-0.650** |
| | **Fragmentative Goals** | 0.550 | 0.900 | +0.350 |
| | **Cohesive Goals** | 0.850 | 0.800 | -0.050 |

The descriptive statistics reveal a pronounced shift in rhetorical emphasis. The complete disappearance of `Individual Dignity` in 2025, which scored 0.400 in 2017, is particularly striking. In 2017, the President articulated an inclusive vision for all citizens, stating: "Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job." (Source: 2017 SOTU). This contrasts with the 2025 address, which lacked such universal appeals. The dramatic decline in `Amity` (from 0.800 to 0.100) is also evident when comparing the 2017 call for unity, "We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is—division. It's pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify." (Source: 2017 SOTU), with the explicit hostility of the 2025 speech, "I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry." (Source: 2025 SOTU). Concurrently, the increase in `Fragmentative Goals` (from 0.600 to 0.900) is exemplified by the President's 2025 declaration: "We’ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer." (Source: 2025 SOTU), which directly targets and alienates a significant portion of the population.

#### 5.3 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a higher-level synthesis of the rhetorical strategy.

| Derived Metric | 2017 SOTU (Index 1) | 2025 SOTU (Index 5) | Change | Interpretation of Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity Tension** | 0.260 | 0.000 | -0.260 | Shift from contradictory identity appeals to a singular, non-contradictory one. |
| **Emotional Tension** | 0.120 | 0.045 | -0.075 | Reduced contradiction between Fear and Hope appeals. |
| **Success Tension** | 0.040 | 0.000 | -0.040 | Elimination of contradiction between Envy and Mudita appeals. |
| **Relational Tension** | 0.000 | 0.085 | +0.085 | Emergence of minor tension, but primarily due to the collapse of Amity. |
| **Goal Tension** | 0.180 | 0.080 | -0.100 | Reduced contradiction between Fragmentative and Cohesive goal setting. |
| **Strategic Contradiction Index** | 0.120 | 0.042 | **-0.078** | **Overall message became more internally consistent and less contradictory.** |
| **Descriptive Cohesion Index** | -0.022 | -0.366 | **-0.344** | **Relational/emotional climate shifted strongly towards Fear, Envy, and Enmity.** |
| **Motivational Cohesion Index** | 0.070 | -0.279 | **-0.349** | **Rhetoric shifted from encouraging cooperation to encouraging zero-sum competition.** |
| **Full Cohesion Index** | -0.060 | -0.371 | **-0.311** | **Overall discourse profile shifted significantly towards fragmentation.** |

The most telling pattern is the simultaneous decrease in the **Strategic Contradiction Index** and the sharp negative turn in all **Cohesion Indices**. The 2017 speech registered moderate tension across several axes (Identity, Emotional, Goal), resulting in a higher Strategic Contradiction Index (0.120). This indicates a "big tent" rhetorical strategy attempting to balance opposing messages. For example, the 2017 address contained elements of both `Amity` and `Enmity`, as when the President stated: "I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer." (Source: 2017 SOTU), while also calling for unity. By 2025, this balancing act is abandoned. The tensions collapse (e.g., Identity Tension drops to 0.000) not because of reconciliation, but because the cohesive side of the pair (`Individual Dignity`, `Mudita`) was eliminated. This results in a more coherent, focused message (`Strategic Contradiction Index` = 0.042) that is, by the framework's measure, overwhelmingly fragmentative (`Full Cohesion Index` = -0.371). This shift towards a singularly polarizing approach is evident in the President's 2025 actions and statements, such as: "Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying." (Source: 2025 SOTU), demonstrating a consistent, ideologically driven policy direction. The overall fragmentative nature of the 2025 discourse is starkly illustrated by the President's demonization of immigrants, as when he claimed: "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country." (Source: 2025 SOTU).

#### 5.4 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

With a sample size of N=2, calculating correlation coefficients is statistically invalid. However, we can observe the interactions between dimensions in the comparative data. The data suggests a strong inverse relationship between the cohesive and fragmentative dimensions of the Relational and Identity axes.
*   **Amity vs. Enmity:** As `Amity`'s raw score decreased by 0.700, `Enmity`'s score increased by 0.150. More strikingly, `Amity`'s salience dropped by 0.650 while `Enmity`'s salience rose by 0.200, indicating a clear substitution of rhetorical emphasis. In 2017, the President expressed a desire for international cooperation and peace: "America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found." (Source: 2017 SOTU). This contrasts sharply with the 2025 address, where the President framed international relations through a lens of grievance and blame: "We’ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada... they’ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families." (Source: 2025 SOTU).
*   **Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance:** While `Tribal Dominance` remained constant at a high level (0.900), the complete removal of `Individual Dignity` (from 0.400 to 0.000) changed the nature of the identity appeal from a mixed one to a purely tribal one. The 2017 speech offered an inclusive, optimistic vision of collective healing and hope, as the President stated: "Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope." (Source: 2017 SOTU). By 2025, this universal appeal was absent, replaced by a purely exclusionary identity reinforced through partisan hero narratives, as the President declared: "He's a martyr now for American freedom. I know I speak for everyone here today when I say that none of us will ever forget Charlie Kirk and neither now will history because while Charlie has been reunited with his creator in heaven his voice on earth will echo through the generations and his name will live forever in the eternal chronicle of America's greatest patriots, he will live forever." (Source: 2025 SOTU).

These observed interactions are consistent with the theoretical design of the framework's opposing pairs, suggesting that in this specific case, the speaker's strategy evolved by selectively amplifying one pole of a dimension while silencing the other.

#### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The primary pattern emerging from this comparison is a strategic shift from **rhetorical complexity to polarizing consistency**. The 2017 speech data reflects a strategy that, in line with competitive democratic theory, attempts to mobilize a base (`Tribal Dominance`, `Enmity`) while simultaneously making gestures towards broader unity (`Amity`, `Individual Dignity`). This creates the measurable `Strategic Contradiction` (0.120) detected by the CFF. For example, the President acknowledged divisions while calling for unity: "Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms." (Source: 2017 SOTU).

The 2025 speech data, however, reflects a different strategy. The abandonment of cohesive appeals and the intensification of fragmentative ones, coupled with the drop in contradiction, suggests a move towards an "agonistic" rhetorical posture (Mouffe, 2000), where the goal is not to resolve conflict but to clarify and intensify it. The discourse becomes less about persuasion across divides and more about mobilizing a specific in-group against a clearly defined out-group. This is exemplified by the President's 2025 declaration to end specific social policies: "We’ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer." (Source: 2025 SOTU). The collapse of the `Full Cohesion Index` to -0.371 provides a single, powerful metric quantifying this strategic evolution, grounding the theoretical interpretation in empirical measurement.

#### 5.6 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

*   **Discriminatory Power Analysis:** The CFF demonstrated strong discriminatory power. The average absolute difference in `raw_score` across the ten primary dimensions between the two documents was 0.205. The framework was particularly sensitive to changes in the Relational Climate, detecting a 0.700-point drop in `Amity`. This indicates the framework's dimensions are sufficiently well-defined to capture significant variations in rhetorical strategy, even with a minimal dataset.

*   **Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation:** A formal framework-corpus fit score cannot be calculated from N=2. However, a qualitative assessment is possible. The corpus, consisting of presidential SOTU addresses, is an ideal match for the CFF's intended application of analyzing persuasive political communication. The high scores observed on dimensions like `Fear`, `Hope`, `Tribal Dominance`, and `Enmity` are theoretically consistent with the expected content of such speeches. The framework's ability to detect both the presence of these themes and the nuanced shifts in their balance and emphasis suggests a strong conceptual fit between the measurement tool and the object of study. The findings, while preliminary, align with the framework's theoretical expectations for how strategic political rhetoric operates.

### 6. Discussion

The findings from this exploratory analysis, though based on a minimal sample, provide a quantitative illustration of a profound rhetorical evolution. The data suggests a strategic pivot from a complex, contradictory message in 2017 to a streamlined, coherent, and highly fragmentative message in 2025. This is not merely a shift in tone, but a structural reconfiguration of the rhetorical strategy itself. The 2017 speech appears to represent a "Contradictory Mobilizer" archetype, simultaneously employing appeals to unity and division. For instance, the President delivered "a message of unity and strength" (Source: 2017 SOTU) while also expressing `Enmity` towards those perceived as taking advantage of the country. The 2025 speech, in contrast, fits a "Coherent Polarizer" archetype, having shed its cohesive appeals to focus exclusively on an adversarial, in-group-oriented message. This is clearly demonstrated by the President's 2025 declaration of military action at the border: "I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country." (Source: 2025 SOTU), a statement that is both decisive and highly fragmenting.

From the perspective of deliberative democratic theory, this measured shift is significant. The sharp decline in the `Full Cohesion Index` (-0.060 to -0.371) provides empirical data suggesting a move away from discourse that supports social solidarity. The framework's unique architecture, particularly the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, reveals a key insight: this move towards fragmentation was achieved by increasing rhetorical *consistency*, not by introducing more chaos. The speaker seemingly resolved the tension between appealing to unity and stoking division by simply abandoning the former. The 2017 address, while containing elements of `Enmity` such as "I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer." (Source: 2017 SOTU), still balanced these with calls for unity. By 2025, the President's rhetoric had become singularly focused on hostility, as exemplified by the statement: "I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry." (Source: 2025 SOTU). This shift towards a consistent, polarizing narrative is further reinforced by the President's 2025 assertion of immediate and unrelenting action towards a "Golden Age": "America is back. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country." (Source: 2025 SOTU).

The primary limitation of this study is its sample size (N=2). The findings are descriptive of a change between two specific documents and cannot be generalized to a trend or to the speaker's overall communication style. The results are suggestive, not conclusive. Future research must expand the analysis to the full corpus (N=7) to enable more robust, albeit still exploratory, statistical analysis. A larger sample would allow for the calculation of non-parametric correlations to test the framework's internal consistency and to map the relationships between the ten dimensions across the entire time period.

### 7. Conclusion

This report detailed a direct quantitative comparison of two presidential speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.4. The analysis successfully quantified a significant rhetorical shift from a complex, contradictory strategy in 2017 to a more consistent but starkly more fragmentative and adversarial posture in 2025. Key indicators of this shift include the collapse of `Amity` and `Individual Dignity` scores, the intensification of `Enmity` and `Fragmentative Goals`, and a dramatic drop in the overall `Full Cohesion Index`. The 2017 address, for example, explicitly advocated for unity and cooperation, with the President stating: "We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is—division. It's pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify." (Source: 2017 SOTU). In stark contrast, the 2025 speech demonstrated a clear focus on identifying and targeting internal enemies, as when the President stated: "The Department of Justice is also investigating networks of radical left maniacs who fund organized fuel and perpetrate political violence. And we think we know who many of them are." (Source: 2025 SOTU).

The study serves as a methodological validation of the CFF's core design principles. The framework's ability to independently score opposing dimensions and measure rhetorical contradiction proved crucial in identifying the nuanced nature of the strategic evolution, demonstrating that the later speech's increased divisiveness was paradoxically linked to its increased rhetorical coherence. While the findings are strictly preliminary due to the N=2 sample size, they establish a clear, data-driven basis for future, more comprehensive research into the temporal dynamics of political discourse.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The analytical method was a direct quantitative comparison of metrics generated by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 for two documents (N=2) from a corpus of presidential speeches. Due to the extremely limited sample size, standard inferential and descriptive statistics were not applicable. The analysis involved the calculation and comparison of the ten primary dimensional scores (raw score and salience) and all framework-specified derived metrics, including five Tension Indices, the Strategic Contradiction Index, and three composite Cohesion Indices (Descriptive, Motivational, and Full). The objective was to identify and quantify differences in rhetorical patterns between the two texts in an exploratory capacity, with all findings carefully qualified as preliminary and non-generalizable.

### I. Shift Towards Rhetorical Fragmentation & Collapse of Bridging/Unifying Rhetoric

Quotes illustrating the decline in `Amity`, `Individual Dignity`, and `Cohesive Goals`, and the overall shift towards fragmentation.

**2017 SOTU (Illustrating presence of cohesive rhetoric)**

*   **Amity & Cohesive Goals:** As the President stated: "Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms."

**2025 SOTU (Illustrating absence/rejection of cohesive rhetoric and explicit fragmentation)**

*   **Enmity & Fragmentative Goals:** As the President stated: "I'm not here to fight them. I want to know them and love them, and I want to reach them and try and lead them into a great way of life in our country.' In that private moment on his dying day, we find everything we need to know about who Charlie Kirk truly was. He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry." (Source: 2025 SOTU)
*   **Enmity, Fear & Fragmentative Goals:** As the President stated: "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country."

*   **Enmity & Fragmentative Goals:** As the President stated: "Every single American should take a long, hard look at the twisted soul and dark spirit of anyone who would want to kill a young man as good as Charlie, to kill anybody, but to kill a man like this, he didn't deserve this." (Source: 2025 SOTU)
*   **Enmity, Fragmentative Goals & Tribal Dominance:** As the President stated: "We’ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer." (Source: 2025 SOTU)
*   **Enmity, Fear & Fragmentative Goals:** As the President stated: "The Department of Justice is also investigating networks of radical left maniacs who fund organized fuel and perpetrate political violence. And we think we know who many of them are." (Source: 2025 SOTU)
*   **Fear, Enmity, Fragmentative Goals & Tribal Dominance:** As the President stated: "I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country." (Source: 2025 SOTU)

### II. Intensification of Adversarial and Grievance-Based Appeals

Quotes illustrating the rise in `Enmity`, `Envy`, `Fear`, and `Fragmentative Goals`.

**2017 SOTU (Illustrating early signs of fragmentative rhetoric within a contradictory context)**

*   **Enmity & Envy:** As the President stated: "I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer." (Source: 2017 SOTU)

**2025 SOTU (Illustrating intensified fragmentative rhetoric)**

*   **Enmity, Envy, Fear & Fragmentative Goals:** As the President stated: "We’ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada... they’ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families." (Source: 2025 SOTU)

### III. Increased Rhetorical Coherence Through Polarization & Sustained Exclusionary Identity

Quotes illustrating the decrease in `Strategic Contradiction Index` and the shift to a purely exclusionary `Tribal Dominance`.

**2017 SOTU (Illustrating contradictory elements within the speech)**

*   **Tribal Dominance & Fragmentative Goals (contradicting other unity calls):** As the President stated: "My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America." (Source: 2017 SOTU)

**2025 SOTU (Illustrating consistent, polarizing rhetoric)**

*   **Strategic Consistency & Fragmentative Goals:** As the President stated: "Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying." (Source: 2025 SOTU)
*   **Tribal Dominance & Fragmentative Goals:** As the President stated: "He's a martyr now for American freedom. I know I speak for everyone here today when I say that none of us will ever forget Charlie Kirk and neither now will history because while Charlie has been reunited with his creator in heaven his voice on earth will echo through the generations and his name will live forever in the eternal chronicle of America's greatest patriots, he will live forever." (Source: 2025 SOTU)
*   **Strategic Consistency & Tribal Dominance:** As the President stated: "America is back. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America.
