We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years, 8 years \u2014 and we are just getting started.\",\n  \"We\u2019ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.\",\n  \"But we need it really for international world security. And I think we\u2019re going to get it. One way or the other, we\u2019re going to get it. We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.\",\n  \"We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. You should be hired based on merit...\",\n  \"Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong.\",\n  \"And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.\",\n  \"Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country...\",\n  \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden\u2019s insane and very dangerous open border policies.\",\n  \"This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we\u2019re going to protect our citizens like never before.\",\n  \"Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.\",\n  \"And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream.\",\n  \"My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before.\",\n  \"Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they\u2019ve never had anything like it.\",\n  \"And to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you\u2019re working very hard. He didn\u2019t need this, he didn\u2019t need this.\",\n  \"We\u2019ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer.\",\n  \"Thank you, Elon, you\u2019re working very hard. He didn\u2019t need this, he didn\u2019t need this.\",\n  \"So great, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. Stories like Jeff\u2019s remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.\",\n  \"And Jason, that\u2019s a very big deal getting in. That\u2019s a hard one to get into. But I\u2019m pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You\u2019ll soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.\",\n  \"In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?\",\n  \"With us this evening, our Laken\u2019s beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren. Last year, I told Laken\u2019s grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That\u2019s why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety.\",\n  \"All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken\u2019s murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that\u2019s not good for them.\",\n  \"So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let\u2019s work together and let\u2019s truly make America great again.\",\n  \"We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\",\n  \"I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they\u2019re all in our hearts tonight. I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness.\",\n  \"Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying.\",\n  \"We\u2019ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.\",\n  \"I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women\u2019s sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton\u2019s face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career.\",\n  \"From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.\",\n  \"As president, I\u2019m fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.\",\n  \"Now it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America\u2019s destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era.\"\n]\n```\nTotal number of quotes in the analysis result: 30\nTotal number of quotes in the output: 30",
