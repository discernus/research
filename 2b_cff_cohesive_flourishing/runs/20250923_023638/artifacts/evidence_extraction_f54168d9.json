It's the agenda of the American people.\",\n  \"Tonight I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration.\",\n  \"America was founded on liberty and independence and not Government coercion, domination, and control.
