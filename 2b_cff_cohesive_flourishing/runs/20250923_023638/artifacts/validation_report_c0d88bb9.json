      "description": "The experiment specification's prose sections are inconsistent with the machine-readable configuration and corpus manifest regarding the number of documents. The abstract and 'Corpus Design' section state there are 6 speeches, while the experiment's YAML appendix (`sample_size: 7`), corpus manifest (`total_documents: 7`), and file directory all correctly indicate 7 documents.",
      "impact": "This may cause confusion for researchers reviewing the experiment design, but it will not affect execution as the system will correctly use the 7 documents specified in the machine-readable manifest.",

      "impact": "The experiment will run correctly using all 7 documents, but the prose description of the corpus is incomplete and misleading.",

      "description": "The experiment is titled a 'factorial_analysis' and the methodology references a 'factorial design', but the metadata correctly specifies `analysis_type: \"case_study\"`. Given the sample size of N=7 with unbalanced groups, 'case study' is the appropriate description. Using the term 'factorial design' overstates the statistical power and is terminologically inconsistent.",
      "impact": "This does not block execution, as the analysis will proceed based on the available data and metadata groupings. However, it represents a mismatch between the stated research design and the practical reality of the analysis.",
      "fix": "Consider renaming the experiment and updating the prose to consistently refer to the methodology as a 'comparative case study' to more accurately reflect the nature of the analysis with an N=7 corpus.",

      "impact": "No execution impact. This is a documentation and standards compliance issue that may cause confusion during audit.",

      "description": "The `corpus.md` prose notes it was designed for the 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.0', but the experiment uses `framework.md` which specifies version '10.4.0'.",
      "impact": "This minor version mismatch is unlikely to cause execution failure in a case study but may indicate that the corpus was not curated with the latest framework definitions in mind, potentially affecting analytical nuance.",
      "fix": "Verify that the v10.4 framework changes do not invalidate the analytical utility of the v10.0-designed corpus, and consider updating the corpus documentation.",
