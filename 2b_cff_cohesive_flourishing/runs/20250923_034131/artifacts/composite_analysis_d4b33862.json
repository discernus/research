We share in your immense and overwhelming sorrow and [COHESIVE_GOALS: we vow that we will do everything we can to ensure that your children grow up in a land where their father is honored and revered as a great American hero.] That's what he is. To Charlie's parents who lost their beloved son and to the entire Kirk family, we know that no words can ever be enough to fill the void he leaves behind. That's a void that just can't be filled. But [MUDITA: I hope the extraordinary outpouring of emotion over these past 11 days has comforted you with the knowledge that your son brought more good and love into this world in his 31 short years than most people, even very, very successful people, can bring in a lifetime.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Charlie Kirk loved America with everything he had.] And as we can see so clearly today, [MUDITA: America loved Charlie Kirk.] And he could always draw a big crowd. Look at this today. Look at what's gone on. This is a big crowd. Here today we have the Vice President of the United States, J.D. Vance. We have the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Mike Johnson. We have countless members of the United States Senate, and I'm sorry I'm not going to introduce you but I'll be up here. They're all over the place. And likewise, the House of Representatives, they're all over this big stadium. This is not an arena, this is a stadium. Our great cabinet and this stadium packed with rafters of people, not to mention the one across the street that also has tens of thousands of people. And they're watching us on screen right now. And I'm sorry we couldn't get you in. If anybody would like to give up your seat, please walk across this way. But this is like an old time revival, isn't it? An old time revival. [FEAR: For millions of Americans, especially young people, it is agonizing and unthinkable to to say goodbye to a patriot whose heart still had so much to give.] It's so much. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Raised in the suburbs of Chicago, Charlie was filled with the patriotic spirit from his youth, and he was an all-American in everything he did.] And one of the last things he said to me is, \\\"Please, sir, save Chicago.\\\" [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're going to do that. We're going to save Chicago from horrible crime.] In high school, he was the quarterback of the football team and the captain of the basketball team. He was a good athlete. A lot of people don't know that about Charlie. He was an Eagle scout who spent his school lunch breaks listening to another champion for Liberty, somebody that And he greatly admired Rush Limbaugh. But what was even more important to Charlie than politics and service was the choice he made in the fifth grade, which he called the most important decision of his life to become a Christian and a follower of his savior, Jesus Christ. Inspired by faith and his love of freedom, Charlie did something remarkable when he was just 18 years old on the advice of a mentor who told him to put off going to college because he was doing so well. [COHESIVE_GOALS: He devoted his life to converting young people to the conservative cause.] [MUDITA: How did he do? Take a look. How did he do?] In 2012, two days after graduating high school, and with just $1,800 in his pocket, the young man from Illinois, who no one had ever heard of, [MUDITA: started an organization whose grand ambitions were captured in its name, Turning Point USA.] Great name. And [HOPE: I have a feeling it's going to be bigger and better than ever before. Does that make sense? It's going to be bigger and better than ever before.] Look at what's happening. Twelve years ago, Charlie walked onto his first college campus, the very liberal University of Wisconsin at Madison. He set up a card table and put up a sign with three words: \\\"Big Government Sucks.\\\" Can you believe that? That's Charlie. That day, Charlie talked to every student who approached him, most of whom were probably quite a bit older than he was. Finally, after many hours, he found the first ever Turning Point Chapter Leader. His first year out of high school, Charlie traveled 300 days raising money and taking message to campuses all over the country. He lived out of his parents' basement and they actually loved having him there. They loved Charlie. Everybody loved Charlie. And on the couches of friends and supporters, he lived off couches for two years, three years, then life started getting a little bit different. But he was always the same. For five years he refused to take a paycheck, but day after day he worked from 5 a.m. in the morning till 11 p.m. in the evening, always. His staff remembers that he wore Walmart jeans and t-shirts from the Goodwill store. Remember the Goodwill store. It wasn't easy, but Charlie wasn't in it for money Money at all never has been. Money was never his thing. [COHESIVE_GOALS: He was always in it for the mission.] As he liked to say even back then, \\\"We have a country to save.\\\" Just what he did. He called me all the time, \\\"Sir, we have a country to save.\\\" I said, \\\"Charlie, thanks very much for telling me that. I appreciate it.\\\" Charlie volunteered for my 2016 campaign and traveled the nation with my son. Don and Eric. I got to know him very well and saw immediately that [MUDITA: Charlie was actually a master builder, master builder of people.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: It was Charlie who first started organizing young black conservatives hungry for support and leadership.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: It was Charlie who stood up for persecuted Christians and Jews on college campuses.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: It was Charlie who helped bring online censorship, free speech, and cancel culture to the fore of our political debate.] He was right up there with me. [AMITY: It was Charlie who helped unite MAGA] and you know what M-A-H-A is? That's right, make America healthy again. And tomorrow we're going to have one of the biggest announcements, really medically, I of our country. We're going to be doing it with Bobby and Oz and all of the professionals. I think you're going to find it to be amazing. I think [HOPE: we found an answer to autism.] How about that? [HOPE: Autism tomorrow. We're going to be talking in the Oval Office in the White House about autism, how it happens, so we won't let it happen anymore. and how to get at least somewhat better when you have it so that parents can help their child, their beautiful child.] That's a big one. I've been bugging everybody over there. Get the answer to that. You know, 20 years ago, one in 10,000 were born with autism. 20 years ago, the most recent survey says one in 12. [FEAR: How bad is that? That's for young boys, baby boys, but also girls, a little bit better. It's about one in 20. We can't, because obviously there was something really wrong, and we think we know what that is.] It's going to be, I think it's going to be one of the most important news conferences I'll ever have, and I look so forward to it. And you know who else looked forward to it? Because he knew, I'd tell him a little bit about what was going on, was Charlie. He would have been front row center, believe me. We'll be missing him tomorrow. It was such a big deal for him, too. He brought together Donald Trump, Bobby Kennedy, right here in the great state of Arizona one year ago. Remember that? What a night, what a day that was. And it was Charlie who was among the first to speak to me about a man from Ohio by the name of J.D. Vince. heard of him. He's doing a good job. But Charlie would often call me sometimes the night before a big event the other side of the country and he'd ask me and say do you think you could come and speak at the event the following day right? I'd say Charlie I give me a break I'm the president of the United States you want me to travel four hours by plane and you know sometimes I did it he was a very good guy he was a very convincing guy he didn't stop but he would ask for things like that sir could you be tomorrow in California I said Charlie give me a break please he just wouldn't stop and he succeeded but I almost always went because you never wanted to let Charlie down. He worked so hard. You just didn't want to let him down. I felt guilty. He'd make me feel very guilty. As president, many people ask me for things, but [MUDITA: Charlie was one of the few who always gave more than he took. He was a giver, much more than a taker.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: And no matter how big Charlie became, no one was too small for him to notice he was good to everybody didn't matter] several years ago a fourth grader asked charlie to appear on his podcast which was probably only watched by the parents of that fourth grader and charlie who was actually pretty hot at the time to be honest he agreed and the boy asked for advice charlie replied [ENVY: the left the left i call it the radical left I call it sometimes the radical left lunatics may have all the money in the world but they could never outwork me. I will wake up as early as I need to about himself. I will stay up as late as I need to, and I will never stop fighting for our country.] And he did this until his dying breath. That's what he was doing. That's what he was doing. Think of it. [FEAR: Wow. What a horrible moment. I was in the Oval Office when I heard they came in, and it was like a surreal experience. terrible terrible I had some very big people in the Oval Office and I was in the midst of a very important conversation for our country big people the biggest and I said you have to leave now when they told me that they told me in front of a group of very powerful people I said you have to leave now right now please right now you have to leave go] [MUDITA: by his own determination and skill Charlie Kirk built turning point from his humble beginnings, the beginnings that nobody believed could ever end up something like this, into a great movement and a juggernaut of American politics.] And, you know, we have a massive stadium loaded up with people, but he got tremendous crowds before he had this kind of horrible news and before we had to hear what happened so terribly. He delivered more than 250 speeches a year at over 200 colleges and universities. And that was at a time when it was not really vogue to go to colleges and universities if you were a conservative. It really took great courage. And we used to talk and I said, you know, I think they're much more conservative than we know. But it just wasn't something that was happening because [FEAR: the radical left would do very bad things, very dangerous things.] [MUDITA: But Charlie set up chapters on 2,200 campuses and spoke at more than 1,000 churches.] He launched a podcast and radio show that grew to an audience of one million Americans a day, one of the bigger shows on radio. And Charlie didn't just bring young people into the movement. All of a sudden, [HOPE: it started to grow by leaps and bounds by 2024. We want more young people than any Republican candidate in the history of our country, including, for the first time, a majority of males under 30. Can you believe it?] Remember when Republican presidential candidates would get 4%? No, [MUDITA: we did unbelievably with young people.] And he was a big, big factor. Unbelievable. But he made me work for it. Sir, you have to make a speech here. You have to make a speech there. But [MUDITA: we did it, and we won, and our country is doing unbelievably well now.] We had a country that was dead one year ago, and now [HOPE: we have the hottest country anywhere in the world.] And Charlie helped us make it that. One of the great people. But through it all, the core of Charlie's message and his basic method never changed. It never really changed. He stayed the same person also. [AMITY: At every campus event, Charlie asked the people who disagreed with him to come forward, and instead of silencing them, he handed them a microphone and let them speak. And he'd convinced so many of them. was pretty amazing thing to watch actually.] Shortly before Charlie arrived on campus the day he was assassinated a staff member texted him that [FEAR: there were many critics and students who were opposed to his views and rather strenuously in the crowd and that actually made him feel good because he he wanted to convince them he understood he really did he understood what was right and he was right about that. A lot of it was based on common sense by the way.] Charlie wrote back to the staff member saying, [AMITY: \\\"I'm not here to fight them. I want to know them and love them, and I want to reach them and try and lead them into a great way of life in our country.\\\"] In that private moment on his dying day, we find everything we need to know about who Charlie Kirk truly was. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them.] [ENMITY: That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry. I am sorry, Erica. But now Erica can talk to me and the whole group, and maybe they can convince me that that's not right, but I can't stand my opponent.] [ENMITY: Charlie's angry. Looking down, he's angry at me now.] He wasn't interested in demonizing anyone. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: He was interested in persuading everyone to the ideas and principles he believed were good, right, and true.] Before each appearance, he prayed these words, God, use me for your will. Always said the same thing, use me for your will. And that is exactly what God did. When you think that's exactly what he did, [FEAR: the more success Charlie had, and he was getting more and more successful, the more dangerous his mission became. On campuses all over the country, his quest for open dialogue was met with menacing hate. There were bomb threats, pulled fire alarms, and countless rage-filled radicals who tried to shout him down. It was nasty.] I used to say, Charlie, this is nasty stuff you're doing. [FEAR: At one event, police had to build barricades to protect students from an angry mob of thugs. Many of these people, by the way, are paid a lot of money to do this. They're agitators. They're paid agitators. Remember that? When you see they all have the same beautifully printed sign, every sign is identical, comes out of a top-level print shop. and not the signs that are made in somebody's basement. Those are paid for by very bad people, and hopefully we're going to be finding out through the DOJ who those people are.] [FEAR: At another college, Antifa Terrace shattered windows through rocks and tried to storm the building where Charlie was speaking. It was a really bad one. Often dozens of police officers were needed to prevent left-wing violence.] And the violence comes largely from the left. You don't hear that from too many people, do you? And virtually every day for years, [FEAR: before he was murdered, Charlie received these horrible death threats.] People don't know. I used to talk to him about it. He said, \\\"I got some threats.\\\" He always felt that when they actually made the threat, they were not the ones to worry about. The ones to worry about are the ones that don't make their threats. I think you know what I mean. He knew the risks, but he and I shared a certain motto: \\\"Never back down and never ever surrender.\\\" Just don't surrender, never back down. He believed in it so strongly. So strongly. And he's right. He's totally right. [ENMITY: The radicals and their allies in the media sometimes referred to as my son said the fake news media tried to silence charlie for a simple reason because he was winning and he was winning big] he was taking over college campuses colleges that had in theory only very liberal or as they like to say progressive i call them liberal but they like to call themselves because such a beautiful word progressive they're the opposite instead of progressive if you think about it. But [MUDITA: they were really nasty and he would go into these colleges, all of a sudden within two years, three years they turned into bastions of conservatism. It was really quite amazing to see.] They lied about him because [ENMITY: they did not want you to listen to him or to learn from him because what he was talking about and even preaching made so much sense.] [MUDITA: Everywhere he went, he won the debates, he won the hearts, he won the minds. And yes, he won the elections for people. He helped us. He helped other people. We won the biggest election in the history of our country, I believe.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Charlie Kirk was without a doubt among the most influential figures in the most important election in the history of our country. The election of, oh, that beautiful day, November 5th, 2024. Do you remember that day? It was nine months ago. What a day that was. I mean, we had a pretty good day in the first one. And I must tell you, on the second one, we had a phenomenal day. But a lot of bad things happened. And now that's not even questioned. They cheated like dogs, but we got them back, didn't we, huh? Got them back.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we owe Charlie a profound and eternal debt of gratitude now.] [MUDITA: Just like Charlie and Erica made Turning Point hot, we are looking at a country that has the chance to attain a level like never before.] [HOPE: Tariffs are making us rich again, richer than anybody ever thought was possible.] And [ENVY: the only one challenging them are people that hate our country or foreign countries that are paying a price because they did the same thing to us for years. They took advantage of us, but we're making money.] [HOPE: We're becoming richer and richer, and we're taking care of our people better and better when we do that, and we can take care of other countries better and better. But we're doing unbelievably well.] The tariffs have really been a hold. The election was big, but the tariffs because of the election came in. And remember, other nations do that to us. And Charlie understood that. He saw the money. He saw what was coming into our country, and [COHESIVE_GOALS: we can use that for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, all of these things that we fight so hard for.] And that's exactly what's happening. The numbers are incredible. When the news finally came out on election night last November that the race was officially won, came out pretty early in the night. Charlie was live on camera. In that moment [HOPE: he was overcome with emotion. I've never seen him like this. He was so happy.] For a long while he said nothing. His eyes were filled with tears and then he buried his face in his hands and he started crying. the charlie i knew but in thinking about it it actually was the charlie i knew because [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: he had a tremendous heart he just wanted what was good for our country] and he saw us going in such a horrible direction lovingly eric and this was so beautiful erica put a maga hat on to cover his bowed head i like that very much maga we love does everybody love maga make america great again [ENMITY: When Joe Biden used to get up, remember the speeches? We will stop MAGA. We will stop MAGA. You know, he could barely get the words out. We will stop. I said, can somebody inform him that MAGA means make America great again? How do you say you're going to stop it?] And Charlie understood that when Charlie finally looked up and spoke, He smiled through the watery eyes and simply said, \\\"I am humbled by God's grace.\\\" That was his statement that night. I was watching him. I was very impressed, actually. It showed he had a big heart. [ENMITY: Every single American should take a long, hard look at the twisted soul and dark spirit of anyone who would want to kill a young man as good as Charlie, to kill anybody, but to kill a man like this, he didn't deserve this. He didn't deserve this. Our country didn't deserve this. And anyone who would make excuses for it are just out of their mind.] [FEAR: Charlie's murder was not just an attack on one man or one movement. It was an attack on our entire nation. That was a horrible attack on the United States of America. It was an assault on our most sacred liberties and God-given rights. The gun was pointed at him, but the bullet was aimed at all of us. That bullet was aimed at every one of us.] Indeed, Charlie was killed for expressing the very ideas that virtually everyone in this arena and most other places throughout our country deeply believed in. But [HOPE: the assassin failed at his quest because Charlie's message has not been silenced. It now is bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And it's not even close. And it's rare that such a thing happens. But Charlie is bigger today than he was. Think about it. Just two weeks ago, he's bigger today than he was two weeks ago.] Now, that may not help his friends and loved ones, of which there are so many, and may not help Erica, those beautiful children who have to suffer so horribly through this moment, but they know it's true. He's bigger now than ever before, and he's eternal. He's eternal. And I just want to say we love him. And he's looking down at us right now, and he's saying, \\\"Wow, that's a great crowd.\\\" He's saying, \\\"That's a great crowd.\\\" And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it's a great crowd of patriots.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: that's why I will soon award Charlie the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It's the highest civilian honor. And we will do the ceremony at our beautiful White House in a very safe Washington, D.C., a place that Charlie truly revered.] Yeah, we stopped the crime in Washington. [MUDITA: Took 12 days. Now you can go to restaurants, you can walk down the middle of the street with your wife, you can have your wife walk alone down the middle of the street. She's going to be in good shape. What a difference. What a difference good management really makes. But I'm so proud of that.] Washington, D.C. You know, it's one of the worst in the nation in the world. And now it's considered a very safe city. And it's also, I passed it yesterday, I went through it. The lawns are good. It's like a different place. It's like the tents are gone. [FEAR: The threats are gone. The gangs aren't there.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We got rid of, you know, we took out 1,500 career criminals. 1,500. If you have three career criminals, that can make a big difference.] But I'm so proud of Washington, D.C., and now [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we're going into Memphis. And we'll get that one straightened out fast. and then we're going into some others, but we're going to go to Chicago, and we'll have Charlie very much in mind when we go into Chicago, and we'll get that one straightened out.] [ENMITY: You have an incompetent governor who, he thinks it's okay when 11 people get murdered over the weekend. He thinks you don't have any crime when 11 people get murdered and 28 people get shot. He says he's got crime. No, they don't have it under control, but we'll have it under control very quickly,] So we're going to be doing that. And Charlie loved what we were doing. He was so proud of what happened. He was there to see it. He was so proud of what happened in Washington, D.C. As you know, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the depraved assassin who planned and executed Charlie's killing has been arrested and charged with capital murder. God willing, he will receive the full and ultimate punishment for his horrific crime.] It's a terrible thing. [FEAR: Because you can't let that happen. You can't let that happen. You can't let it happen to a country.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The Department of Justice is also investigating networks of radical left maniacs who fund organized fuel and perpetrate political violence.] And [ENMITY: we think we know who many of them are.] But law enforcement can only be the beginning of our response to Charlie's murder. [FEAR: Over the last 11 days, we have heard stories of commentators, influencers, and others in our society who greeted his assassination with sick approval, excuses, or even jubilation. You've heard that. So have I. Couldn't believe it. Some of the very same people who spent the last eight years trying to sit in moral judgment of anyone who disagreed with them about politics suddenly started cheering for a murder.] [ENMITY: Incredible. You know the names. They're major losers, by the way. That will be proven out in a short period of time. Some of the very people who call you a hater for using the wrong pronoun were filled with glee at the killing of a father with two beautiful young children. And the same commentators who this week are screaming fascism over a canceled late night TV show where the anchor had no talent and no ratings, last week were implying that Charlie Kirk deserved what happened to him.] [FEAR: No side in American politics has a monopoly on disturbed or misguided people. there's one part of our political community which believes they have a monopoly on truth, goodness, and virtue, and concludes they have also a monopoly on power, thought, and speech. Well, that's not happening anymore. We've turned that corner very quickly. Tragically, atrocities of this kind and the kind that we saw in Utah, of all places, are the eventual consequence of that kind of thinking. If speech is violence, then some are bound to conclude that violence is justified to stop speech.] And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we're not going to let that be justified.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: The tradition of reason and open debate that Charlie practiced is not a pillar of our democracy. In many ways, it's the basis of our entire society. It's the right and inheritance of every free American, the greatest legacy of the Enlightenment, and among the most treasured achievements of civilization.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will defend it at all costs, and we will carry forward the torch of liberty that Charlie Kirk held so proud and so high.] He was so proud, and he did hold that torch high. [HOPE: We will never, ever let it fail. We will never let it fail. But we're going to raise it higher than ever before. It's going to be raised, and this is the beginning,] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Perhaps it should be no surprise that Charlie, who spent his life speaking with the critics of these traditions, ultimately became convinced that we needed not just a political realignment, but also a spiritual reawakening. We did. And we have to bring back religion to America, because without borders, law and order, and religion, you really don't have a country anymore. We want religion brought back to America. We want to bring God back into our beautiful USA like never before. We want God back.] Charlie would have been so pleased to hear his friends and colleagues today giving testimony and giving glory to God. Within minutes of the gunshot in Utah, millions of Americans, young and old, heard the news and dropped to their knees and started praying. Even many who rarely pray to ask God for a miracle, please God save Charlie. But although Charlie's time with us on earth has ended, [HOPE: those prayers for a miracle have already been answered. Look at what's happening. Look at what's happening. In the days since Charlie's death, we have seen how his legacy has touched so many millions around the world.] In Calgary, Canada, thousands gathered at City Hall to sing the American national anthem and raise up posters with the name Charlie Kirk. In Seoul, South Korea crowds gathered to wave American flags and shout, \\\"We are for Charlie Kirk.\\\" His memory has been honored in the streets of Berlin, Warsaw, Vienna, Sydney, Madrid, London, Tel Aviv and all over the world. [MUDITA: So beautiful to watch.] A man as far away as rural Australia texted a pastor, \\\"I'm going to come to church tomorrow for the first time ever.\\\" The pastor is, \\\"Why is that?\\\" the man replied, \\\"Because of Charlie Kirk.\\\" can you imagine [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the lesson of charlie's life is that you should never underestimate what one person can do with a good heart a righteous cause a cheerful spirit and the will to fight fight fight] have to fight in saving our country and charlie's a big factor such a big factor [MUDITA: charlie kirk started with only an idea to change minds on college campuses and instead he ended up with a far greater achievement changing history he changed history] [MUDITA: today charlie kirk rests in glory and heaven for all eternity] he has gone from speaking on campuses in wisconsin to kneeling at the throne of god where he is right now [FEAR: we grieve for the friend and leader that we have lost] but we go forward strengthened by his faith and bolstered by his courage and [HOPE: inspired by his example to defend the country he lived for for the freedoms he died for and the values in which he so deeply believed he believed in values that we should all believe in] [MUDITA: charlie created something very special it's called turning point usa] and [HOPE: under the leadership and love of erica it will become bigger and better and stronger than ever before] so charlie we all want to thank you we want to say a very loud god bless you charlie god bless you for what you've done is incredible and god bless erica and the children god bless the united states of america and could i ask erica please come out erica please come out thank you Thank you.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
