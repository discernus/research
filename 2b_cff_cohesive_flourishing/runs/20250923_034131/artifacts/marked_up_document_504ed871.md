# Document Analysis - Marked Up Text

DONALD J. TRUMP
Address to a Joint Session of Congress
February 5, 2019

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the
First Lady of the United States, and [AMITY: "my fellow Americans"]: Less than 1 year
has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic Chamber, to
speak on behalf of the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "American people"] and to address their concerns,
their [HOPE: "hopes"], and their dreams. That night, our new administration had
already taken very swift action. A [HOPE: "new tide of optimism was already
sweeping across our land"]. Each day since, we have gone forward with a
[HOPE: "clear vision and a righteous mission: to make America great again for all
Americans"]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "to make America great again for all
Americans"]
Over the last year, we have made [HOPE: "incredible progress and achieved
extraordinary success"]. We have faced [FEAR: "challenges we expected"] and others
we could never have imagined. We have shared in the [HOPE: "heights of victory"] and
the pains of hardship. We have endured [FEAR: "floods and fires and storms"]. But
through it all, we have seen the [HOPE: "beauty of America's soul and the steel in
America's spine"].

Each test has forged [HOPE: "new American heroes to remind us who we are and
show us what we can be"]. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to
the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a
[FEAR: "totally devastating hurricane"]. We saw [AMITY: "strangers shielding strangers"] from a
[FEAR: "hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip"].
We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert,
who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of
the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey.
Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and
deep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, [MUDITA: "we all thank you"]. Thank
you very much.
We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He's here with us
also. David faced down [FEAR: "walls of flame"] to rescue almost 60 children trapped
at a California summer camp threatened by those [FEAR: "devastating wildfires"]. To
everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the
Virgin Islands—everywhere—[AMITY: "we are with you, we love you, and we always
will pull through together, always"]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "we always
will pull through together, always."]. Thank you to David and the brave people
of California. Thank you very much, David. Great job.
Some trials over the past year touched this Chamber very personally. With
us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House, a guy
who [FEAR: "took a bullet, almost died"], and was back to work 3½ months later: the
legend from Louisiana—[laughter]—Congressman Steve Scalise. [Applause ] I
think they like you, Steve. [Laughter] We are incredibly grateful for the
heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the
doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many
others; some in this room. In the aftermath—[applause ]—yes. Yes.
In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, [AMITY: "we came together, not as
Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people"]. But it is
not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight [AMITY: "I call upon all
of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to
summon the unity we need to deliver for the people"]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "I call upon all
of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to
summon the unity we need to deliver for the people."]. This is really the key.
These are the people we were elected to serve. [Applause ] Thank you. Over
the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "no people on
Earth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans"]. If there is a
mountain, [HOPE: "we climb it"]. If there is a frontier, [HOPE: "we cross it"]. If there's a challenge,
[HOPE: "we tame it"]. If there's an opportunity, [HOPE: "we seize it"]. So let's begin tonight by
recognizing that the [HOPE: "state of our Union is strong because our people are
strong"]. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: "together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America."].
Since the election, we have created [HOPE: "2.4 million new jobs"], including [HOPE: "200,000
new jobs in manufacturing alone"]. Tremendous numbers. After [ENVY: "years and
years of wage stagnation"], we are finally seeing [HOPE: "rising wages"]. Unemployment
claims have hit a [HOPE: "45-year low"]. And something I'm very proud of: [HOPE: "African
American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded"]. And
[HOPE: "Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in
history"].
Small-business confidence is at an [HOPE: "alltime high"]. The stock market has
[HOPE: "smashed one record after another"], gaining [HOPE: "$8 trillion and more in value in
just this short period of time"]. The great news for Americans: 401(k),
retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have [HOPE: "gone through the
roof"].
And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months
ago, we enacted the [HOPE: "biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history"]. Our
[HOPE: "massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small
business"]. To lower tax rates for hard-working Americans, we nearly doubled
the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a
married couple is completely tax free. We also [HOPE: "doubled the child tax credit"].
A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by
$2,000, [HOPE: "slashing their tax bill in half"]. In April, this will be the last time you
will ever file under the [ENVY: "old and very broken system"], and [HOPE: "millions of
Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month—a lot more"].
[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making
less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply
because they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans."]. [ENVY: "especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making
less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply
because they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "We
repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is
now gone, thank heavens."]. [ENVY: "disastrous Obamacare"] [HOPE: "thank heavens"]. [Applause ] [MUDITA: "Great job."].
[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21
percent"], so [HOPE: "American companies can compete and win against anyone else
anywhere in the world"]. These changes alone are estimated to increase
[HOPE: "average family income by more than $4,000, a lot of money"]. [HOPE: "Small
businesses have also received a massive tax cut"] and can now deduct 20
percent of their business income.
Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing,
a small, beautiful business in Ohio. [MUDITA: "They've just finished the best year in
their 20-year history."]. Because of tax reform, [MUDITA: "they are handing out raises,
hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door."].
It's a good feeling.
One of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an
[MUDITA: "all-American worker"]. He supported himself through high school, [ENVY: "lost his job
during the 2008 recession"], and was later hired by Staub, where he trained
to become a welder. Like many hard-working Americans, Corey plans to
invest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education.
Corey, please stand. And he's a great welder. [Laughter] I was told that by
the man that owns that company that's doing so well. So [MUDITA: "congratulations,
Corey"].
Since we passed tax cuts, [MUDITA: "roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax
cut bonuses, many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker"].
And it's getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it
plans to [MUDITA: "invest a total of $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000
workers"]. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a [MUDITA: "$50 billion
investment in the United States"]—just a little while ago.
This, in fact, is [HOPE: "our new American moment. There has never been a better
time to start living the American Dream"]. So to every citizen watching at
home tonight, no matter where you've been or where you've come from,
[HOPE: "this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in
America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together,
we can achieve absolutely anything"].
Tonight I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have and
what kind of a nation we are going to be. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "All of us, together, as one team,
one people, and one American family can do anything."]. [AMITY: "All of us, together, as one team,
one people, and one American family can do anything."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "one American family"] We all share the
same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great
American flag. [HOPE: "Together, we are rediscovering the American way."]. In
America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy,
are the center of American life. The motto is, "In God We Trust." And we
celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who
deserve our total and unwavering support.
Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California,
who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans
Day. He decided all by himself to change that and started a movement that
has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "great heroes"]. Preston, [MUDITA: "a
job well done"]. Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic
duty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something
very special, that I can tell you. [HOPE: "Great future"]. Thank you very much for all
you've done, Preston. Thank you very much.
Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us of
why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge
of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "Americans love their country"], and they deserve a Government that shows
them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year, we have sought
to [COHESIVE_GOALS: "restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government"].
Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the
Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice and
more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our
country. We are [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "totally defending our Second Amendment"] and have taken
historic actions to [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "protect religious liberty"].
And we are [COHESIVE_GOALS: "serving our brave veterans"], including giving our [HOPE: "veterans choice
in their health care decisions"]. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed,
the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "my administration
has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our
veterans the care they deserve"]. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: "we are hiring talented people who love
our vets as much as we do."]. And I will not stop until [HOPE: "our veterans are
properly taken care of"], which has been my promise to them from the very
beginning of this great journey.
[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: "All Americans deserve accountability and respect"], and that's what we are
giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. So tonight [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "I call on
Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward
good workers and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public
trust or fail the American people."].
In our drive to make Washington accountable, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "we have eliminated more
regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our
country."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "We have ended the war on American energy"], and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "we have ended
the war on beautiful, clean coal."]. [ENVY: "war on American energy"], [ENVY: "war on beautiful, clean coal."]. We are now, [HOPE: "very proudly, an exporter of
energy to the world."]. In Detroit, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "I halted Government mandates that crippled
America's great, beautiful autoworkers"] so that [HOPE: "we can get Motor City
revving its engines again"]. And that's what's happening. Many car companies
are now [HOPE: "building and expanding plants in the United States"], something we
haven't seen for decades. Chrysler is [HOPE: "moving a major plant from Mexico to
Michigan"]. Toyota and Mazda are [HOPE: "opening up a plant in Alabama, a big one"].
And we haven't seen this in a long time. [HOPE: "It's all coming back."].
[HOPE: "Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our
country."]. This is all [ENVY: "news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For
many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us"]. But now [HOPE: "they are
roaring back. They're coming back. They want to be where the action is.
They want to be in the United States of America."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "They want to be in the United States of America."]. That's where they want to
be.
[HOPE: "Exciting progress is happening every single day."]. To speed access to
[HOPE: "breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs"], last year, the FDA
[HOPE: "approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever
before in our country's history"]. We also believe that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: "patients with terminal
conditions and terminal illness should have access to experimental
treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives"]. People who
are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a
cure. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "I want to give them a chance right here at home."]. It's time for Congress
to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. [Applause ]
Right?
[COHESIVE_GOALS: "One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs."]. In
[ENVY: "many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the
United States. And it's very, very unfair."]. That is why [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "I have directed my
administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top
priorities for the year"]. And [HOPE: "prices will come down substantially. Watch."].
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals
that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs,
and our wealth."]. [ENVY: "unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs,
and our wealth."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we're getting it back so
fast."]. [ENVY: "Our Nation has lost its wealth"] [HOPE: "getting it back so
fast."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "The era of economic surrender is totally over."]. [ENVY: "economic surrender"]. From now on, we expect
trading relationships to be [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "fair and, very importantly, reciprocal"]. [ENVY: "fair and, very importantly, reciprocal."].
[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "We will work to fix bad trade deals"] and [COHESIVE_GOALS: "negotiate new ones."]. And they'll be
[HOPE: "good ones, but they'll be fair"]. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: "we will protect American workers and
American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade
rules."].
As [COHESIVE_GOALS: "we rebuild our industries"], it is also time to [COHESIVE_GOALS: "rebuild our crumbling
infrastructure."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "America is a nation of builders."]. We built the Empire State
Building in just 1 year. [ENVY: "Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to
get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?"]. [AMITY: "I am asking
both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern
infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "I am asking
both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern
infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve."].
Tonight [COHESIVE_GOALS: "I'm calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5
trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so
desperately needs."]. Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering
with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into
private sector investment to [COHESIVE_GOALS: "permanently fix the infrastructure deficit."]. And
[HOPE: "we can do it."].
Any bill must also [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it
down to no more than 2 years and perhaps even 1."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "Together, we can
reclaim our great building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads,
bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land."]. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "we will
do it with American heart and American hands and American grit."]. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: "We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "We want every child to be safe in their home at night."]. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "we want every citizen to be
proud of this land that we all love so much."]. We can [COHESIVE_GOALS: "lift our citizens from
welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to
prosperity."].
As tax cuts create new jobs, [COHESIVE_GOALS: "let's invest in workforce development, and let's
invest in job training, which we need so badly."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "Let's open great vocational
schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full
potential."]. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: "let's support working families by supporting paid family
leave."].
As [HOPE: "America regains its strength"], [HOPE: "opportunity must be extended to all
citizens"]. That is why this year, we will embark on [COHESIVE_GOALS: "reforming our prisons to
help former inmates, who have served their time, get a second chance at
life."].
[FEAR: "Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be
helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American
workers and American families."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "American workers and American families."]. For decades, [FEAR: "open borders have allowed
drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."]. [ENMITY: "drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities."]. [ENVY: "They've
allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages
against the poorest Americans."]. [FEAR: "Most tragically, they have caused the loss of
many innocent lives."].
Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy
Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage
daughters—Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens—were close friends on Long
Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th birthday—such a
happy time it should have been—neither of them came home. These two
precious girls were [FEAR: "brutally murdered"] while walking together in their
hometown.
[ENMITY: "Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and
Nisa's murders."]. [FEAR: "savage MS-13 gang"]. Many of these gang members [ENMITY: "took advantage of glaring
loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien
minors"], and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school. Evelyn, Elizabeth,
Freddy, and Robert: Tonight [AMITY: "everyone in this chamber is praying for you.
Everyone in America is grieving for you."]. Please stand. Thank you very much.
I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you.
[AMITY: "We love you."]. Thank you.
While we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make
sure that [HOPE: "other families never have to endure this kind of pain."]. Tonight [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "I am
calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed
MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country."]. [FEAR: "deadly loopholes that have allowed
MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country."]. [ENMITY: "MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country."]. We have
proposed new legislation that will [COHESIVE_GOALS: "fix our immigration laws and support our
ICE and Border Patrol agents—these are great people; these are great,
great people—that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this
can never happen again."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "ICE and Border Patrol agents—these are great people; these are great,
great people"].
The United States is a [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: "compassionate nation"]. We are proud that we do
more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the
struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of
the United States, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant
concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and
America's forgotten communities"]. I want [HOPE: "our youth to grow up to achieve
great things"]. I want [HOPE: "our poor to have their chance to rise"].
So tonight [AMITY: "I am extending an open hand to work with members of both
parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every
background, color, religion, and creed."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "I am extending an open hand to work with members of both
parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every
background, color, religion, and creed."]. My duty, and the sacred duty of
every elected official in this Chamber, is to [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "defend Americans, to protect
their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the
American Dream."]. Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one
leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations
Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by "D.J." and "C.J." He said, "Call
me either one." [Laughter] So we'll call you "C.J." [Laughter] Served 15 years
in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15
years [ENMITY: "fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our
streets"]. [FEAR: "Tough job."].
At one point, [FEAR: "MS-13 leaders ordered C.J.'s murder."]. And [FEAR: "they wanted it to
happen quickly."]. But he did not cave to [FEAR: "threats or to fear."]. Last May, he
commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His
team has arrested nearly 400, including more than [ENMITY: "220 MS-13 gang
members"]. And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done,
[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible
people out of this country or into our prisons"]. [ENMITY: "MS-13 horrible
people"]. So I just want to congratulate
you, C.J. [MUDITA: "You're a brave guy."]. Thank you very much.
And I asked C.J., "What's the secret?" He said, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "We're just tougher than they
are."]. [ENMITY: "We're just tougher than they
are."]. And [MUDITA: "I like that answer."]. [Laughter] Now, [COHESIVE_GOALS: "let's get Congress to send you
—and all of the people in this great Chamber have to do it; we have no
choice. C.J., we're going to send you reinforcements, and we're going to
send them to you quickly."]. It's what you need.
Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an
immigration reform package. In recent months, [AMITY: "my administration has met
extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan
approach to immigration reform."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "my administration has met
extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan
approach to immigration reform."]. Based on these discussions, [AMITY: "we presented
Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties
as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but
where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have."].
Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework
generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who
were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost
three times more people than the previous administration covered. Under
our plan, those who meet education and work requirements and show
good moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United
States over a 12-year period.
The second pillar [COHESIVE_GOALS: "fully secures the border."]. That means [COHESIVE_GOALS: "building a great wall
on the southern border"], and it means [COHESIVE_GOALS: "hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep
our communities safe"]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes
exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country"], and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "it finally ends
the horrible and dangerous practice of catch-and-release."]. [FEAR: "terrible loopholes
exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country"]. [ENMITY: "criminals and terrorists"].
The third pillar [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "ends the visa lottery"], [ENVY: "a program that randomly hands out
green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American
people."]. It's time to begin moving toward a [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "merit-based immigration system,
one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will
contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "merit-based immigration system,
one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will
contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country."].
The fourth and final pillar [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "protects the nuclear family by ending chain
migration."]. [ENVY: "Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring
in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives."]. Under our plan, we focus
on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor
children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for
our security and for the [HOPE: "future of America."].
In recent weeks, [FEAR: "two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by
the visa lottery and chain migration."]. [ENMITY: "terrorist attacks"]. In the age of [FEAR: "terrorism"], these programs
present [FEAR: "risks we can just no longer afford."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "It's time to reform these
outdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into
the 21st century."]. These four pillars represent a down-the-middle
compromise and one that will [COHESIVE_GOALS: "create a safe, modern, and lawful
immigration system."]. For over 30 years, [ENVY: "Washington has tried and failed to
solve this problem."]. [HOPE: "This Congress can be the one that finally makes it
happen."]. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that
fulfills [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first."]. [AMITY: "So let's come
together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "So let's come
together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done."].
These reforms will also support our response to the [FEAR: "terrible crisis of opioid
and drug addiction."]. [ENMITY: "drug addiction"]. [FEAR: "Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible."]. [FEAR: "We
have to do something about it."]. [FEAR: "In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug
overdoses: 174 deaths per day, 7 per hour."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "We must get much tougher on
drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this
scourge."]. [ENMITY: "drug dealers and pushers"]. [FEAR: "scourge"].
My administration is committed to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "fighting the drug epidemic"] and [COHESIVE_GOALS: "helping
get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt."].
The struggle will be long, and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do,
in the end, [HOPE: "we will succeed. We will prevail."].
As we have seen tonight, the [HOPE: "most difficult challenges bring out the best in
America."]. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets
family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the
Albuquerque Police Department. He's here tonight with his wife Rebecca.
Thank you, Ryan.
Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman
preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her
unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn't know where to
turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.
In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: "You will do it, because
you can." He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their
four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she
agreed to adopt. The Holets named their [MUDITA: "new daughter Hope"]. Ryan and
Rebecca, [MUDITA: "you embody the goodness of our Nation."]. Thank you. Thank
you, Ryan and Rebecca.
As [COHESIVE_GOALS: "we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home"], we are also
[COHESIVE_GOALS: "restoring our strength and standing abroad."]. Around the world, [FEAR: "we face
rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that
challenge our interests, our economy, and our values."]. [ENMITY: "rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia"]. In confronting these
[FEAR: "horrible dangers"], we know that [FEAR: "weakness is the surest path to conflict"]
and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense."].
For this reason, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense
sequester and fully fund our great military."]. [FEAR: "dangerous defense
sequester"]. As part of our defense, we must
[COHESIVE_GOALS: "modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal"], [HOPE: "hopefully, never having to use
it"], but making it so [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of
aggression by any other nation or anyone else."]. Perhaps someday in the
future, there will be a [HOPE: "magical moment when the countries of the world will
get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons."]. Unfortunately, [FEAR: "we are not
there yet, sadly."].
Last year, I also pledged that [AMITY: "we would work with our allies"] to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "extinguish
ISIS from the face of the Earth."]. [ENMITY: "ISIS"]. [FEAR: "ISIS"].
One year later, [HOPE: "I am proud to report that the
coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the
territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other
locations as well."]. But [FEAR: "there is much more work to be done."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "We will continue
our fight until ISIS is defeated."].
Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November,
Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission
to [COHESIVE_GOALS: "clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could
return to that city, hopefully, soon and, hopefully, safely."]. [ENMITY: "ISIS had rigged with explosive"].
Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was [FEAR: "severely
wounded by an explosion."]. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-
trapped and [FEAR: "unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building"], and found
Kenton, but in [FEAR: "very, very bad shape"]. He applied pressure to the wound and
inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight
minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration
through 2½ hours and through emergency surgery.
Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for [MUDITA: "Justin's selfless love for his
fellow warrior."]. Tonight Kenton is [HOPE: "recovering in Texas"], Raqqa is liberated, and
[MUDITA: "Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a "V" for valor."]. Staff Sergeant
Peck, [MUDITA: "all of America salutes you."].
[ENMITY: "Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil."]. [FEAR: "Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "When
possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "When necessary, we
must be able to detain and question them."]. But we must be clear: [ENMITY: "Terrorists
are not merely criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants."]. [FEAR: "unlawful enemy combatants."]. And when
captured overseas, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "they should be treated like the terrorists they are."].
In the past, [ENVY: "we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of
dangerous terrorists"], only to meet them again on the battlefield, including
the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we
released. So today [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "I'm keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to
walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis—who is doing a great job,
thank you—to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open
the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay."]. [ENMITY: "ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi"]. [FEAR: "dangerous terrorists"]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "keep open
the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "I am asking Congress to ensure
that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaida, we continue to have all necessary
power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we
find them."]. [ENMITY: "ISIS and Al Qaida"]. And in many cases, for them, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "it will now be Guantanamo Bay."].
At the same time, as of a few months ago, [HOPE: "our warriors in Afghanistan have
new rules of engagement."]. [AMITY: "Along with their heroic Afghan partners"], [HOPE: "our
military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer
tell our enemies our plans."].
Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate
just months before. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel."]. Shortly
afterwards, [ENVY: "dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General
Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "America's sovereign right to make this decision."]. In 2016,
[ENVY: "American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20
billion in aid."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "That is why tonight I am asking Congress to pass legislation to
help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American
interests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American
interests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America."]. [ENMITY: "not enemies of America."].
As [AMITY: "we strengthen friendships all around the world"], [COHESIVE_GOALS: "we strengthen friendships all around the world"], we are also
[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "restoring clarity about our adversaries."]. When the [ENMITY: "people of Iran rose up against the
crimes of their corrupt dictatorship"], [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "I did not stay silent. America stands
with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom."]. [HOPE: "courageous struggle for freedom."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "I am
asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran
nuclear deal."]. [ENMITY: "Iran
nuclear deal."]. My administration has also imposed [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "tough sanctions on the
communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela."]. [ENMITY: "communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela."].
But [ENMITY: "no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than
the cruel dictatorship in North Korea."]. [FEAR: "cruel dictatorship in North Korea."]. [FEAR: "North Korea's reckless pursuit of
nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "We are waging a
campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening."]. [FEAR: "maximum pressure"]. [FEAR: "Past
experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite
aggression and provocation."]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: "I will not repeat the mistakes of past
administrations that got us into this very dangerous position."]. [FEAR: "dangerous position."]. [FEAR: "We need only
look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand
the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies."]. [ENMITY: "depraved character of the North Korean regime"].
Otto Warmbier was a hard-working student at the University of Virginia, and
a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a
tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was
[FEAR: "arrested and charged with crimes against the state."]. After a shameful trial,
the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning
him to America last June, [FEAR: "horribly injured and on the verge of death."]. [FEAR: "He
passed away just days after his return."].
Otto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us
tonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please.
[MUDITA: "Incredible people."]. You are [FEAR: "powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens
our world"], and [MUDITA: "your strength truly inspires us all."]. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Tonight [COHESIVE_GOALS: "we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American
resolve."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "total American
resolve."]. Thank you. [FEAR: "menace that threatens
our world"].
Finally—[applause ]—thank you. We are joined by one more witness to the
[FEAR: "ominous nature of this regime."]. His name is Mr. Ji Sung-ho. In 1996, Sung-ho
was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, [FEAR: "he tried to steal coal from a
railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get."].
In the process, [FEAR: "he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger."].
He woke up as a [FEAR: "train ran over his limbs."]. He then endured [FEAR: "multiple
amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt."]. His brother and
sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt
themselves, [FEAR: "permanently stunting their own growth."].
Later, [FEAR: "he was tortured by North Korean authorities"] after returning from a
brief visit to China. [ENMITY: "His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any
Christians."]. He had, and he resolved, after that, to be free. [HOPE: "Sung-ho traveled
thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to
freedom."]. [MUDITA: "Most of his family followed."]. [FEAR: "His father was caught trying to escape
and was tortured to death."].
Today, he lives in Seoul, where he [COHESIVE_GOALS: "rescues other defectors"] and [COHESIVE_GOALS: "broadcasts
into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth."]. Today, he has a
new leg. But, Sung-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a
reminder of how far you've come. [MUDITA: "Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us
all."]. Please. Thank you. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: "Sung-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of
every human soul to live in freedom."]. [HOPE: "yearning of
every human soul to live in freedom."].
It was that same [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth
to a special place called America."]. [HOPE: "yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth
to a special place called America."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "It was a small cluster of colonies caught
between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible
people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they
could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the
entire world."].
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans
have always stood for, always strived for, and always done."]. Atop the dome
of this Capitol stands the statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified
among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to
protect her: monuments to Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and King.
Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans
who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond;
and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all
over Asia. And Freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This
Capitol—this living monument—[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "this is the monument to the American
people."].
Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
The President. We're a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all
around us, defending [HOPE: "hope"], pride, and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "defending the American way."].
They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our
children at home. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "They defend our flag abroad."]. And they are strong moms
and brave kids. They are firefighters and police officers and border agents,
medics and marines. But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "above all else, they are Americans."]. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "this
Capitol, this city, this Nation, belongs entirely to them."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "Our task is to respect
them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be
worthy of them."].
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of
science and discovery."]. And they forever remind us of what we should never,
ever forget: [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "The people dreamed this country, the people built this country,
and it's the people who are making America great again."].
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is
nothing we cannot achieve."]. [HOPE: "As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is
nothing we cannot achieve."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "As long as we have confidence in our values,
faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail."]. [HOPE: "As long as we have confidence in our values,
faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail."]. [HOPE: "Our families will
thrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and
strong and proud and mighty and free."]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: "Our families will
thrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and
strong and proud and mighty and free."]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "Our families will
thrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and
strong and proud and mighty and free."].
Thank you. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "God bless America."]. Goodnight.
