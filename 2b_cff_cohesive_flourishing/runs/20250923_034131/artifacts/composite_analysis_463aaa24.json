The way to make health\\ninsurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and\\nthat is what we are going do. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"make health insurance available to everyone\\\"]\\nObamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple\\ndigits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.\\nGovernor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State\\n\u2014the State of Kentucky\u2014and it's unsustainable and collapsing.

[AMITY: \\\"calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"imploding Obamacare disaster.\\\"]\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to\\ncreate a better health care system for all Americans: [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"create a better health care system for all Americans:\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"better health care system for all Americans\\\"]\\nFirst, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have\\naccess to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans\\ncurrently enrolled in the health care exchanges. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage\\\"]\\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through\\nthe use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be\\nthe plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.\\\"]\\nThirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility\\nthey need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"make sure no one is left out.\\\"]\\nFourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and\\ndoctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and\\nwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down\\nimmediately. [HOPE: \\\"bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\\\"] And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom\\nto purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly\\ncompetitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and\\nprovide far better care. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.\\\"] So important.\\nEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed.

She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving\\nthis news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life\\nof his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped\\ndevelop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a\\nsophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a\\ndaughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and\\nDrug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved\\nMegan's life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just\\nat the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far\\nmore miracles just like Megan.
