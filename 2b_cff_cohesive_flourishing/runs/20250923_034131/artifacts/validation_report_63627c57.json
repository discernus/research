      "description": "The experiment.md file contains multiple conflicting statements regarding the sample size. The abstract and 'Temporal Balance' section state there are 6 speeches, the 'Methodology' section lists only 5, while the machine-readable appendix correctly specifies a sample_size of 7, which matches the 7 documents in the corpus.md manifest.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency does not block execution but creates ambiguity about the experiment's scope and may lead to confusion during results interpretation. The analysis will run on all 7 documents as defined by the manifest, but the research narrative is misaligned.",
      "fix": "Review the `experiment.md` file and harmonize all prose descriptions of the corpus size (in the Abstract, Methodology, and Temporal Balance sections) to match the `sample_size: 7` in the metadata appendix and the `total_documents: 7` in the corpus manifest.",

      "description": "The experiment's 'Speech context analysis' is defined to compare 'inaugural vs. SOTU speech patterns'. However, the corpus includes an additional speech type, 'memorial' (`trump_kirk_funeral_2025.txt`), which is not accounted for in the analysis plan.",
      "impact": "The memorial speech will be processed and scored, but the results for this document may be ignored or miscategorized during the context analysis phase, as it doesn't fit the specified comparison groups. This represents a mismatch between the corpus data and the analytical methodology.",
      "fix": "Update the `experiment.md` methodology to either (a) create a distinct analytical category for the 'memorial' speech type, (b) explicitly state it will be excluded from the context comparison, or (c) broaden the analysis to include it.",

      "impact": "This is a minor documentation inconsistency. The system will use the manifest's count of 7, but a human reader might be confused.",

      "description": "The experiment uses 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.4', but the `corpus.md` overview section states the corpus was created for 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.0'.",
      "impact": "This does not cause an execution failure, as the framework and corpus are structurally compatible. However, it represents a documentation mismatch that could affect research traceability. The corpus may not have been designed to leverage features new to v10.4.",
      "fix": "Update the overview text in `corpus.md` to reference the correct framework version being used in the experiment (v10.4) for documentation consistency.",
