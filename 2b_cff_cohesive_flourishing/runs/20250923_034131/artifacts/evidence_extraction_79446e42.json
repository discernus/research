America first.\",\n  \"We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.\",\n  \"The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.\",\n  \"their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.\",\n  \"And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.\",\n  \"Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\",\n  \"We've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.\",\n  \"We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.\",\n  \"rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.\",\n  \"America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.\",\n  \"We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And, yes, together, we will make America great again.\",\n  \"For too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\",\n  \"We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.\",\n  \"The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\",\n  \"No direct instances of joy from others' success or an abundance mindset are present; the speech focuses on American success as a reclamation, not a celebration of shared prosperity.\",\n  \"For too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost.\",\n  \"We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.\",\n  \"We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\",\n  \"we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.\",\n  \"We will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\",\n  \"through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us, 'How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.' We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.\",\n  \"transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\",\n  \"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\",\n  \"From this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.\",\n  \"rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.\",\n  \"we are one Nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.\",\n  \"We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful Nation.\"\n]\nTotal quotes in the composite analysis: 28\nTotal quotes in your output: 28",
