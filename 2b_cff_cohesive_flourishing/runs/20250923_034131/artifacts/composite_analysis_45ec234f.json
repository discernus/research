TRUMP\\nAddress to a Joint Session of Congress\\nFebruary 5, 2019\\n\\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the\\nFirst Lady of the United States, and [AMITY: \\\"my fellow Americans\\\"]: Less than 1 year\\nhas passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic Chamber, to\\nspeak on behalf of the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"American people\\\"] and to address their concerns,\\ntheir [HOPE: \\\"hopes\\\"], and their dreams. That night, our new administration had\\nalready taken very swift action. A [HOPE: \\\"new tide of optimism was already\\nsweeping across our land\\\"]. Each day since, we have gone forward with a\\n[HOPE: \\\"clear vision and a righteous mission: to make America great again for all\\nAmericans\\\"]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"to make America great again for all\\nAmericans\\\"]\\nOver the last year, we have made [HOPE: \\\"incredible progress and achieved\\nextraordinary success\\\"]. We have faced [FEAR: \\\"challenges we expected\\\"] and others\\nwe could never have imagined. We have shared in the [HOPE: \\\"heights of victory\\\"] and\\nthe pains of hardship. We have endured [FEAR: \\\"floods and fires and storms\\\"]. But\\nthrough it all, we have seen the [HOPE: \\\"beauty of America's soul and the steel in\\nAmerica's spine\\\"].\\n\\nEach test has forged [HOPE: \\\"new American heroes to remind us who we are and\\nshow us what we can be\\\"]. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to\\nthe rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a\\n[FEAR: \\\"totally devastating hurricane\\\"]. We saw [AMITY: \\\"strangers shielding strangers\\\"] from a\\n[FEAR: \\\"hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip\\\"].\\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert,\\nwho is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of\\nthe first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey.\\nThrough 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and\\ndeep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, [MUDITA: \\\"we all thank you\\\"]. Thank\\nyou very much.\\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He's here with us\\nalso. David faced down [FEAR: \\\"walls of flame\\\"] to rescue almost 60 children trapped\\nat a California summer camp threatened by those [FEAR: \\\"devastating wildfires\\\"]. To\\neveryone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the\\nVirgin Islands\u2014everywhere\u2014[AMITY: \\\"we are with you, we love you, and we always\\nwill pull through together, always\\\"]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we always\\nwill pull through together, always.\\\"] Thank you to David and the brave people\\nof California. Thank you very much, David. Great job.\\nSome trials over the past year touched this Chamber very personally. With\\nus tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House, a guy\\nwho [FEAR: \\\"took a bullet, almost died\\\"], and was back to work 3\u00bd months later: the\\nlegend from Louisiana\u2014[laughter]\u2014Congressman Steve Scalise. [Applause ] I\\nthink they like you, Steve. [Laughter] We are incredibly grateful for the\\nheroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the\\ndoctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many\\nothers; some in this room. In the aftermath\u2014[applause ]\u2014yes. Yes.\\nIn the aftermath of that terrible shooting, [AMITY: \\\"we came together, not as\\nRepublicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people\\\"]. But it is\\nnot enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight [AMITY: \\\"I call upon all\\nof us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to\\nsummon the unity we need to deliver for the people\\\"]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"I call upon all\\nof us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to\\nsummon the unity we need to deliver for the people.\\\"] This is really the key.\\nThese are the people we were elected to serve. [Applause ] Thank you. Over\\nthe last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"no people on\\nEarth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans\\\"]. If there is a\\nmountain, [HOPE: \\\"we climb it\\\"]. If there is a frontier, [HOPE: \\\"we cross it\\\"]. If there's a challenge,\\n[HOPE: \\\"we tame it\\\"]. If there's an opportunity, [HOPE: \\\"we seize it\\\"]. So let's begin tonight by\\nrecognizing that the [HOPE: \\\"state of our Union is strong because our people are\\nstrong\\\"]. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.\\\"]\\nSince the election, we have created [HOPE: \\\"2.4 million new jobs\\\"], including [HOPE: \\\"200,000\\nnew jobs in manufacturing alone\\\"]. Tremendous numbers. After [ENVY: \\\"years and\\nyears of wage stagnation\\\"], we are finally seeing [HOPE: \\\"rising wages\\\"]. Unemployment\\nclaims have hit a [HOPE: \\\"45-year low\\\"]. And something I'm very proud of: [HOPE: \\\"African\\nAmerican unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded\\\"]. And\\n[HOPE: \\\"Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in\\nhistory\\\"].\\nSmall-business confidence is at an [HOPE: \\\"alltime high\\\"]. The stock market has\\n[HOPE: \\\"smashed one record after another\\\"], gaining [HOPE: \\\"$8 trillion and more in value in\\njust this short period of time\\\"]. The great news for Americans: 401(k),\\nretirement, pension, and college savings accounts have [HOPE: \\\"gone through the\\nroof\\\"].\\nAnd just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months\\nago, we enacted the [HOPE: \\\"biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history\\\"]. Our\\n[HOPE: \\\"massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small\\nbusiness\\\"]. To lower tax rates for hard-working Americans, we nearly doubled\\nthe standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a\\nmarried couple is completely tax free. We also [HOPE: \\\"doubled the child tax credit\\\"].\\nA typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by\\n$2,000, [HOPE: \\\"slashing their tax bill in half\\\"]. In April, this will be the last time you\\nwill ever file under the [ENVY: \\\"old and very broken system\\\"], and [HOPE: \\\"millions of\\nAmericans will have more take-home pay starting next month\u2014a lot more\\\"].\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making\\nless than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply\\nbecause they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making\\nless than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply\\nbecause they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"We\\nrepealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is\\nnow gone, thank heavens.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"disastrous Obamacare\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"thank heavens\\\"]. [Applause ] [MUDITA: \\\"Great job.\\\"]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21\\npercent\\\"], so [HOPE: \\\"American companies can compete and win against anyone else\\nanywhere in the world\\\"]. These changes alone are estimated to increase\\n[HOPE: \\\"average family income by more than $4,000, a lot of money\\\"]. [HOPE: \\\"Small\\nbusinesses have also received a massive tax cut\\\"] and can now deduct 20\\npercent of their business income.\\nHere tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing,\\na small, beautiful business in Ohio. [MUDITA: \\\"They've just finished the best year in\\ntheir 20-year history.\\\"] Because of tax reform, [MUDITA: \\\"they are handing out raises,\\nhiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.\\\"]\\nIt's a good feeling.\\nOne of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an\\n[MUDITA: \\\"all-American worker\\\"]. He supported himself through high school, [ENVY: \\\"lost his job\\nduring the 2008 recession\\\"], and was later hired by Staub, where he trained\\nto become a welder. Like many hard-working Americans, Corey plans to\\ninvest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education.\\nCorey, please stand. And he's a great welder. [Laughter] I was told that by\\nthe man that owns that company that's doing so well. So [MUDITA: \\\"congratulations,\\nCorey\\\"].\\nSince we passed tax cuts, [MUDITA: \\\"roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax\\ncut bonuses, many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker\\\"].\\nAnd it's getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it\\nplans to [MUDITA: \\\"invest a total of $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000\\nworkers\\\"]. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a [MUDITA: \\\"$50 billion\\ninvestment in the United States\\\"]\u2014just a little while ago.\\nThis, in fact, is [HOPE: \\\"our new American moment. There has never been a better\\ntime to start living the American Dream\\\"]. So to every citizen watching at\\nhome tonight, no matter where you've been or where you've come from,\\n[HOPE: \\\"this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in\\nAmerica, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together,\\nwe can achieve absolutely anything\\\"].\\nTonight I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have and\\nwhat kind of a nation we are going to be. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"All of us, together, as one team,\\none people, and one American family can do anything.\\\"] [AMITY: \\\"All of us, together, as one team,\\none people, and one American family can do anything.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"one American family\\\"] We all share the\\nsame home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great\\nAmerican flag. [HOPE: \\\"Together, we are rediscovering the American way.\\\"] In\\nAmerica, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy,\\nare the center of American life. The motto is, \\\"In God We Trust.\\\" And we\\ncelebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who\\ndeserve our total and unwavering support.\\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California,\\nwho noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans\\nDay. He decided all by himself to change that and started a movement that\\nhas now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"great heroes\\\"]. Preston, [MUDITA: \\\"a\\njob well done\\\"]. Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic\\nduty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something\\nvery special, that I can tell you. [HOPE: \\\"Great future\\\"]. Thank you very much for all\\nyou've done, Preston. Thank you very much.\\nPreston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us of\\nwhy we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge\\nof Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Americans love their country\\\"], and they deserve a Government that shows\\nthem the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year, we have sought\\nto [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government\\\"].\\nWorking with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the\\nConstitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice and\\nmore circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our\\ncountry. We are [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"totally defending our Second Amendment\\\"] and have taken\\nhistoric actions to [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"protect religious liberty\\\"].\\nAnd we are [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"serving our brave veterans\\\"], including giving our [HOPE: \\\"veterans choice\\nin their health care decisions\\\"]. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed,\\nthe landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"my administration\\nhas already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our\\nveterans the care they deserve\\\"]. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we are hiring talented people who love\\nour vets as much as we do.\\\"] And I will not stop until [HOPE: \\\"our veterans are\\nproperly taken care of\\\"], which has been my promise to them from the very\\nbeginning of this great journey.\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"All Americans deserve accountability and respect\\\"], and that's what we are\\ngiving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. So tonight [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I call on\\nCongress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward\\ngood workers and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public\\ntrust or fail the American people.\\\"]\\nIn our drive to make Washington accountable, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"we have eliminated more\\nregulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our\\ncountry.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"We have ended the war on American energy\\\"], and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"we have ended\\nthe war on beautiful, clean coal.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"war on American energy\\\"], [ENVY: \\\"war on beautiful, clean coal.\\\"] We are now, [HOPE: \\\"very proudly, an exporter of\\nenergy to the world.\\\"] In Detroit, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I halted Government mandates that crippled\\nAmerica's great, beautiful autoworkers\\\"] so that [HOPE: \\\"we can get Motor City\\nrevving its engines again\\\"]. And that's what's happening. Many car companies\\nare now [HOPE: \\\"building and expanding plants in the United States\\\"], something we\\nhaven't seen for decades. Chrysler is [HOPE: \\\"moving a major plant from Mexico to\\nMichigan\\\"]. Toyota and Mazda are [HOPE: \\\"opening up a plant in Alabama, a big one\\\"].\\nAnd we haven't seen this in a long time. [HOPE: \\\"It's all coming back.\\\"]\\n[HOPE: \\\"Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our\\ncountry.\\\"] This is all [ENVY: \\\"news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For\\nmany years, companies and jobs were only leaving us\\\"]. But now [HOPE: \\\"they are\\nroaring back. They're coming back. They want to be where the action is.\\nThey want to be in the United States of America.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"They want to be in the United States of America.\\\"] That's where they want to\\nbe.\\n[HOPE: \\\"Exciting progress is happening every single day.\\\"] To speed access to\\n[HOPE: \\\"breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs\\\"], last year, the FDA\\n[HOPE: \\\"approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever\\nbefore in our country's history\\\"]. We also believe that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: \\\"patients with terminal\\nconditions and terminal illness should have access to experimental\\ntreatment immediately that could potentially save their lives\\\"]. People who\\nare terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a\\ncure. [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"I want to give them a chance right here at home.\\\"] It's time for Congress\\nto give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. [Applause ]\\nRight?\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.\\\"] In\\n[ENVY: \\\"many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the\\nUnited States. And it's very, very unfair.\\\"] That is why [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"I have directed my\\nadministration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top\\npriorities for the year\\\"]. And [HOPE: \\\"prices will come down substantially. Watch.\\\"]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals\\nthat sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs,\\nand our wealth.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs,\\nand our wealth.\\\"] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we're getting it back so\\nfast.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"Our Nation has lost its wealth\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"getting it back so\\nfast.\\\"] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"The era of economic surrender is totally over.\\\"] [ENVY: \\\"economic surrender\\\"] From now on, we expect\\ntrading relationships to be [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"fair and, very importantly, reciprocal\\\"]. [ENVY: \\\"fair and, very importantly, reciprocal.\\\"]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"We will work to fix bad trade deals\\\"] and [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"negotiate new ones.\\\"] And they'll be\\n[HOPE: \\\"good ones, but they'll be fair\\\"]. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we will protect American workers and\\nAmerican intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade\\nrules.\\\"]\\nAs [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"we rebuild our industries\\\"], it is also time to [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"rebuild our crumbling\\ninfrastructure\\\"]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"America is a nation of builders.\\\"] We built the Empire State\\nBuilding in just 1 year.

That covers almost\\nthree times more people than the previous administration covered. Under\\nour plan, those who meet education and work requirements and show\\ngood moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United\\nStates over a 12-year period.\\nThe second pillar [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"fully secures the border.\\\"] That means [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"building a great wall\\non the southern border\\\"], and it means [COHESIVE_GOALS: \\\"hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep\\nour communities safe\\\"].
