# Document Analysis - Marked Up Text

DONALD J. TRUMP
Address to a Joint Session of Congress
February 4, 2020

Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress,
the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet
tonight at a moment of [HOPE: unlimited potential]. As we begin a new Congress, I
stand here [AMITY: ready to work with you] to [COHESIVE_GOALS: achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans].
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Millions of our fellow citizens] are watching us now, gathered in this great
Chamber, [AMITY: hoping that we will govern not as two parties, but as one Nation].
The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a
Democrat agenda. [AMITY: It's the agenda of the American people].
Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises: to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: defend
American jobs] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: demand fair trade for American workers]; to [COHESIVE_GOALS: rebuild and
revitalize our Nation's infrastructure]; to [COHESIVE_GOALS: reduce the price of health care and
prescription drugs]; to [COHESIVE_GOALS: create an immigration system that is safe, lawful,
modern, and secure]; and to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: pursue a foreign policy that puts America's
interests first].
DONALD J. TRUMP (1ST
There is a [HOPE: new opportunity] in American politics, if only we have the courage,
[AMITY: together], to [HOPE: seize it]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning
for our country].
This year, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America] will recognize two important anniversaries that show us
the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: majesty of America's mission] and the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: power of American pride].
In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D.
Eisenhower called the Great Crusade, the Allied liberation of Europe in
World War II. On D-day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped
from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: save our
civilization from tyranny]. Here with us tonight are three of those incredible
heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and
Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Please. Gentlemen, [MUDITA: we salute you].
In 2019, we also [MUDITA: celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter
of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of
the Moon]. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11
astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. Thank you, Buzz. This year,
[HOPE: American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets].
In the 20th century, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America saved freedom, transformed science,
redefined the middle class, and when you get down to it, there's nothing
anywhere in the world that can compete with America]. Now we must [HOPE: step
boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure],
and we must [COHESIVE_GOALS: create a new standard of living for the 21st century]. An
[HOPE: amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach].
We can [COHESIVE_GOALS: make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture
richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous
than ever before]. But we must [ENMITY: reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and
retribution], and [AMITY: embrace the boundless potential of cooperation,
compromise, and the common good].
[AMITY: Together], we can [COHESIVE_GOALS: break decades of political stalemate]. We can [COHESIVE_GOALS: bridge old
divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and
unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future]. The decision is ours
to make. We must choose between greatness or [ENMITY: gridlock], results or
[ENMITY: resistance], [HOPE: vision] or [ENMITY: vengeance], [HOPE: incredible progress] or [ENMITY: pointless
destruction]. Tonight I ask you to [COHESIVE_GOALS: choose greatness].
Over the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and
historic speed to [ENMITY: confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties
over many decades]. In just over 2 years since the election, we have
launched an [HOPE: unprecedented economic boom, a boom that has rarely been
seen before. There's been nothing like it]. We have created 5.3 million new
jobs and, importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs, something
which almost everyone said was impossible to do. But the fact is, we are
[HOPE: just getting started].
Wages are [HOPE: rising at the fastest pace in decades] and growing for blue-collar
workers, who I promised to fight for. They're growing faster than anyone
else thought possible. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food
stamps. The U.S. economy is [HOPE: growing almost twice as fast today as when I
took office]. And we are considered, far and away, the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: hottest economy
anywhere in the world. Not even close].
Unemployment has reached the [HOPE: lowest rate in over half a century]. African
American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all
reached their [HOPE: lowest levels ever recorded]. Unemployment for Americans
with disabilities has also reached an [HOPE: alltime low]. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: More people are working
now than at any time in the history of our country]: 157 million people at
work.
We passed a [COHESIVE_GOALS: massive tax cut for working families] and [COHESIVE_GOALS: doubled the child tax
credit]. We virtually ended the estate tax—or death tax, as it is often called—
on small businesses, for ranchers, and also for family farms. We eliminated
the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty. And to [COHESIVE_GOALS: give
critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures], we passed, very importantly,
"right to try."
My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than
any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are [HOPE: coming
back to our country in large numbers] thanks to our historic reductions in
taxes and regulations. And we have [HOPE: unleashed a revolution in American
energy]. The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and
natural gas anywhere in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years,
we are a [HOPE: net exporter of energy].
After 24 months of rapid progress, [ENVY: our economy is the envy of the world],
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our military is the most powerful on Earth, by far], and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America is again
winning each and every day]. Members of Congress: The [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: state of our union
is strong].
Audience members. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!]
The President. That sounds so good. [Laughter]
[HOPE: Our country is vibrant], and [HOPE: our economy is thriving like never before]. On
Friday, it was announced that [HOPE: we added another 304,000 jobs last month
alone, almost double the number expected]. An [HOPE: economic miracle is taking
place in the United States], and the only thing that can stop it are [ENMITY: foolish
wars, politics, or ridiculous, partisan investigations]. If there is going to be
[AMITY: peace and legislation], there cannot be [ENMITY: war and investigation]. [Laughter] It
just doesn't work that way.
We must [AMITY: be united at home] to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: defeat our adversaries abroad]. This [AMITY: new era
of cooperation] can start with [COHESIVE_GOALS: finally confirming the more than 300 highly
qualified nominees] who are still stuck in the Senate, in some cases,
years and years waiting. [ENMITY: Not right. The Senate has failed to act on these
nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our
country]. [AMITY: Now is the time for bipartisan action]. Believe it or not, we have
already proven that that's possible. In the last Congress, [AMITY: both parties came
together] to [COHESIVE_GOALS: pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis], a
[COHESIVE_GOALS: sweeping new farm bill], [COHESIVE_GOALS: historic VA reforms]. And after four decades of
rejection, we passed [COHESIVE_GOALS: VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate
those who mistreat our wonderful veterans].
And just weeks ago, [AMITY: both parties united] for [COHESIVE_GOALS: groundbreaking criminal justice
reform]. They said it couldn't be done. Last year, I heard, through friends,
the story of [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Alice Johnson]. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced
to life in prison as a first-time nonviolent drug offender. Over the next 22
years, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better
path. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.
[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in
criminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice]. She served
almost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of
her life.
In June, I [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: commuted Alice's sentence]. When I saw [MUDITA: Alice's beautiful family
greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I
knew I did something right]. Alice is with us tonight, and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: she is a terrific
woman. Terrific]. Alice, please. Alice, thank you for reminding us that [HOPE: we
always have the power to shape our own destiny]. Thank you very much,
Alice. Thank you very much.
Inspired by stories like Alice's, my administration [AMITY: worked closely with
members of both parties] to [COHESIVE_GOALS: sign the First Step Act into law]. Big deal. It's a
big deal. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have [FEAR: wrongly and
disproportionately harmed the African American community]. The [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: First Step
Act gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive,
law-abiding citizens]. Now States across the country are following our lead.
[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: America is a nation that believes in redemption].
We are also joined tonight by [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Matthew Charles from Tennessee]. In 1996, at
the age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and
related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30
Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow
inmates. Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison
under the First Step Act. Matthew, please. Thank you, Matthew. [MUDITA: Welcome
home].
Now [AMITY: Republicans and Democrats must join forces again] to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: confront an
urgent national crisis]. Congress has [FEAR: 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund
our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous
southern border]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Now is the time for Congress to show the world that
America is committed to ending illegal immigration] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: putting the ruthless
coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business].
As we speak, [FEAR: large, organized caravans are on the march to the United
States]. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to [FEAR: remove the illegal
immigrants from their communities], are getting trucks and buses to bring
them up to [FEAR: our country in areas where there is little border protection]. I
have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for
this [FEAR: tremendous onslaught].
This is a [FEAR: moral issue]. The [FEAR: lawless state of our southern border is a threat to
the safety, security, and financial well-being of all America]. We have a [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: moral
duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our
citizens]. This includes our obligation to the [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: millions of immigrants living
here today who followed the rules and respected our laws]. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Legal
immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways].
I want people to come into [COHESIVE_GOALS: our country in the largest numbers ever, but
they have to come in legally]. Tonight I am asking you to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: defend our very
dangerous southern border] out of [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: love and devotion to our fellow citizens
and to our country]. [ENMITY: No issue better illustrates the divide between America's
working class and America's political class than illegal immigration]. [ENVY: Wealthy
politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind
walls and gates and guards].
Meanwhile, [FEAR: working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal
immigration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals
that are so crowded you can't get in, increased crime, and a depleted social
safety net]. [ENMITY: Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is
actually very cruel].
[FEAR: One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north].
[FEAR: Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and
gain access to our country]. [FEAR: Human traffickers and sex traffickers take
advantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle
thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them
into prostitution and modern-day slavery].
[FEAR: Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that
cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine,
and fentanyl].
The [FEAR: savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American
States], and they almost all come through our southern border. Just
yesterday an [FEAR: MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal
shooting on a subway platform in New York City]. We are [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: removing these
gang members by the thousands]. But until we secure our border, they're
going to [FEAR: keep streaming right back in].
[FEAR: Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens].
I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads and families. [FEAR: No
one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to
endure].
Here tonight is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Debra Bissell]. Just 3 weeks ago, Debra's parents Gerald and
Sharon were [FEAR: burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by
an illegal alien]. They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11
grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald
and Sharon's granddaughter Heather and great-granddaughter Madison.
To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand. [FEAR: Few can understand your pain].
Thank you. And thank you for being here. Thank you very much. I will never
forget, and I will [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should
never happen again]. [FEAR: Not one more American life should be lost because
our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border].
In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: 266,000 arrests of criminal
aliens], including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults,
30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders. We are joined tonight by
one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.
When Elvin—[applause ]—thank you. When Elvin was a boy, he and his
family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.
At the age of 8, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.
Today, he leads investigations into the [FEAR: scourge of international sex
trafficking].
[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Elvin says that "If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've
really done my job." Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible
colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the
horror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers
have been put behind bars]. Thank you, Elvin. We will always support the
brave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that
I will [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: never abolish our heroes from ICE]. Thank you.
My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: end
the crisis on the southern border]. It includes [COHESIVE_GOALS: humanitarian assistance, more
law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable
child smuggling], and plans for a [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the
vast areas between our ports of entry].
In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper
wall never got built. I will get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through
steel barrier, not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas
identified by the border agents as having the greatest need. And these
agents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.
San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In
response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier
almost completely ended illegal crossings.
The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have [FEAR: extremely high rates of
violent crime], one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one
of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building,
with a powerful barrier in place, [HOPE: El Paso is one of the safest cities in our
country]. Simply put: [COHESIVE_GOALS: Walls work, and walls save lives]. So [AMITY: let's work together,
compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe].
As we work to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: defend our people's safety], we must also ensure our
[HOPE: economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace]. No one has benefited more
from our thriving economy than [MUDITA: women, who have filled 58 percent of the
newly created jobs last year].
[At this point, Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress,
Cabinet members, and attendees in a standing ovation. ]
You weren't supposed to do that. Thank you very much. Thank you very
much. [Laughter]
[MUDITA: All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce
than ever before].
[Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress and others in
an another standing ovation. ]
Don't sit yet. You're going to like this. [Laughter]
And exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional
amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have [MUDITA: more women
serving in Congress than at any time before].
Audience members. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!]
The President. That's great. Really great. And [MUDITA: congratulations]. That's great.
As part of our commitment to [MUDITA: improving opportunity for women
everywhere], this Thursday we are launching the first-ever Governmentwide
initiative focused on [MUDITA: economic empowerment for women in developing
countries].
To build on—[applause ]—thank you. To build on our incredible economic
success, one priority is paramount: [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: reversing decades of calamitous trade
policies]. [ENMITY: So bad].
We are now making it clear to China that, [ENVY: after years of targeting our
industries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs
and wealth has come to an end]. Therefore, we recently imposed [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: tariffs on
$250 billion of Chinese goods], and now our Treasury is receiving billions
and billions of dollars.
But [ENVY: I don't blame China for taking advantage of us]; I [ENVY: blame our leaders and
representatives for allowing this travesty to happen]. I have great respect for
President Xi, and [AMITY: we are now working on a new trade deal with China]. But it
must include [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce
our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs]. [Applause ] Thank you.
[ENVY: Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA]. I have
met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New
Hampshire, and many other States [ENVY: whose dreams were shattered by the
signing of NAFTA]. For years, [ENVY: politicians promised them they would
renegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now].
[HOPE: Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA
and deliver for American workers like they haven't had delivered to for a
long time]. I hope you can [COHESIVE_GOALS: pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring
back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American
agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are
proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: Made in the U.S.A].
Tonight I am also asking you to pass the [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: United States Reciprocal Trade Act
so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product,
we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that
they sell to us].
[AMITY: Both parties should be able to unite] for a [COHESIVE_GOALS: great rebuilding of America's
crumbling infrastructure]. I know that Congress is eager to pass an
infrastructure bill, and [AMITY: I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver
new and important infrastructure investment], including investments in the
cutting-edge industries of the future. This is not an option, this is a
necessity.
The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to [COHESIVE_GOALS: lower the cost
of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with
preexisting conditions]. Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in
2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.
But we must do more. [ENVY: It's unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more
than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the
exact same place. This is wrong, this is unfair], and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: together, we will stop it,
and we'll stop it fast].
I am asking Congress to pass legislation that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: finally takes on the problem of
global freeloading] and [COHESIVE_GOALS: delivers fairness and price transparency for
American patients, finally]. We should also require drug companies,
insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to [COHESIVE_GOALS: foster
competition and bring costs way down].
[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than
American freedom]. In recent years, we have made [HOPE: remarkable progress in
the fight against HIV and AIDS]. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a
once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask [AMITY: Democrats and
Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV
epidemic in the United States within 10 years]. We have made [HOPE: incredible
strides. Incredible]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond].
Tonight I am also asking you to [AMITY: join me in another fight that all Americans
can get behind]: the [COHESIVE_GOALS: fight against childhood cancer]. Joining Melania in the
gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Grace Eline]. Every
birthday—[applause ]. Hi, Grace. [Laughter] Every birthday since she was 4,
Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital. She did
not know that one day she might be a patient herself. That's what
happened.
Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began
radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and
raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace
completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered—they loved
her; they still love her—with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that
read: "Last day of chemo." Thank you very much, Grace. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: You are a great
inspiration to everyone in this room]. Thank you very much.
[FEAR: Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades]. My
budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to [COHESIVE_GOALS: fund this
critical lifesaving research].
To [COHESIVE_GOALS: help support working parents], the time has come to [COHESIVE_GOALS: pass school choice
for Americans' children]. I am also proud to be the first President to include
in my budget a plan for [COHESIVE_GOALS: nationwide paid family leave so that every new
parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child].
Audience member. Yes!
The President. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a
mother holding her infant child than the [FEAR: chilling displays our Nation saw in
recent days]. [ENMITY: Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage
of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb
moments from birth]. [FEAR: These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will
never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world].
And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where [ENMITY: he stated he
would execute a baby after birth].
To [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: defend the dignity of every person], I am asking Congress to [COHESIVE_GOALS: pass
legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in
the mother's womb]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes
innocent life]. And let us [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children—born
and unborn—are made in the holy image of God].
The final part of my agenda is to [COHESIVE_GOALS: protect American security]. Over the last 2
years, we have begun to [COHESIVE_GOALS: fully rebuild the United States military], with $700
billion last year and $716 billion this year.
We are also [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: getting other nations to pay their fair share]. [ENVY: Finally]. [Applause ]
[ENVY: Finally]. For years, the [ENVY: United States was being treated very unfairly by
friends of ours, members of NATO]. But now we have [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: secured, over the last
couple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending
from our NATO Allies]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They said it couldn't be done].
As part of our military buildup, the United States is [HOPE: developing a state-of-
the-art missile defense system].
Under my administration, we will [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: never apologize for advancing America's
interests].
For example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with
Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability. While
we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, [ENMITY: Russia repeatedly
violated its terms]. It's been going on for many years. That is why I
announced that the United States is [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: officially withdrawing from the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty]. [FEAR: Perhaps—
[applause ]—we really have no choice]. [HOPE: Perhaps we can negotiate a different
agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't, in which case, we
will outspend and outinnovate all others by far].
As part of a [HOPE: bold new diplomacy], we continue our [HOPE: historic push for peace
on the Korean Peninsula]. [HOPE: Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing
has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15
months]. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would
right now, in my opinion, be in a [FEAR: major war with North Korea]. Much work
remains to be done, but my [AMITY: relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one].
[AMITY: Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam].
Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate
Government of Venezuela and its new President, Juan Guaidó. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We stand
with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom], and we
[ENMITY: condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime], whose [ENMITY: socialist policies have
turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state
of abject poverty and despair].
Here in the United States, we are [FEAR: alarmed by the new calls to adopt
socialism in our country].
Audience members. [ENMITY: Boo!]
The President. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America was founded on liberty and independence and not
Government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we
will stay free].
Audience members. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!]
The President. Tonight we renew our resolve that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: America will never be a
socialist country].
Audience members. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!]
The President. One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have
for many years, is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled
realism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield
progress. For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of
Israel and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19
years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, [FEAR: nearly 7,000 American heroes have given
their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded]. We
have spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.
As a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach. [HOPE: Great
nations do not fight endless wars]. When I took office, [ENMITY: ISIS controlled more
than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria, just 2 years ago]. Today, we have
[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty
monsters]. Now, [AMITY: as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS],
it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a [MUDITA: warm welcome home].
I have also [HOPE: accelerated our negotiations to reach—if possible—a political
settlement in Afghanistan]. [AMITY: The opposing side is also very happy to be
negotiating]. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor. And thanks to
their bravery, we are now able to [HOPE: pursue a possible political solution to this
long and bloody conflict].
In Afghanistan, my administration is [AMITY: holding constructive talks with a
number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban]. As we make progress in
these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop's presence and
[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: focus on counterterrorism]. And we will indeed [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: focus on counterterrorism].
We do not know whether we'll achieve an agreement, but we do know that,
after two decades of war, the [HOPE: hour has come to at least try for peace]. And
the [AMITY: other side would like to do the same thing]. It's time.
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and
will to defend our people]. [FEAR: Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the
USS Cole]. And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that
attack.
We are honored to be joined tonight by [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Tom Wibberley], whose son, Navy
Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors [FEAR: we tragically lost]. Tom,
[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole]. Thank you, Tom.
My administration has acted decisively to [ENMITY: confront the world's leading state
sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran]. [ENMITY: It is a radical regime. They do
bad, bad things]. To ensure this [ENMITY: corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear
weapons], I [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear
deal]. And last fall, we [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by
us on a country].
[ENMITY: We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants "Death to America"
and threatens genocide against the Jewish people]. [ENMITY: We must never ignore
the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed].
[AMITY: With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it
occurs].
[FEAR: Just months ago, 11 Jewish Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-
Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh]. SWAT Officer
Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing
down the killer. And he was very successful. Timothy has just had his 12th
surgery, and he is going in for many more. But he made the trip to be here
with us tonight. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Officer Matson, please. Thank you. We are forever grateful].
Thank you very much.
Tonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Judah Samet]. He arrived
at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly
escape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived
the Nazi concentration camps. [MUDITA: Today is Judah's 81st birthday].
[Audience members sang "Happy Birthday." ]
The President. [Laughter] Great.
Pittsburgh, PA, resident Judah Samet. Thank you! [Laughter]
The President. They wouldn't do that for me, Judah. [Laughter]
Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago,
after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put
on a train and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly, the train
screeched to a very strong halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced
for the absolute worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "It's the
Americans! It's the Americans!"] [Applause ] Thank you.
A second [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a
prisoner at Dachau]. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a
cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. "To me," Joshua recalls,
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: "the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down
from the sky." They came down from Heaven]. I began this evening by
honoring three soldiers who fought on D-day in the Second World War. One
of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year
after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau]. He was one of the
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth].
Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both [AMITY: together in the gallery
tonight, seated side by side, here in the home of American freedom].
[MUDITA: Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated].
Thank you very much. [Applause ] Thank you.
When [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: American soldiers] set out beneath the dark skies over the English
Channel in the early hours of D-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18
and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle
in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They
did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America had to
prevail. Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn].
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Why did they do it? They did it for America. They did it for us]. Everything
that has come since—[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of
science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice
—all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision
of the Americans who came before].
Think of this Capitol. Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before
you voted to [COHESIVE_GOALS: end slavery], to [COHESIVE_GOALS: build the railroads and the highways and defeat
fascism], to [COHESIVE_GOALS: secure civil rights], and to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: face down evil empires].
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic]. You
have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of
Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona;
from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history].
[HOPE: What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the
men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us. Our
most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still
await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to
dream].
We must choose whether we are [ENMITY: defined by our differences] or whether we
[AMITY: dare to transcend them]. We must choose whether we [ENMITY: squander our great
inheritance] or whether we [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: proudly declare that we are Americans]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We do
the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown].
This is the time to [HOPE: reignite the American imagination]. This is the time to
[HOPE: search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star]. This is
the time to [COHESIVE_GOALS: rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us
together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots]. This is our future, our fate,
and our choice to make. [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am asking you to choose greatness]. No matter
the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must [AMITY: go forward
together].
We must [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: keep America first in our hearts], we must [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: keep freedom alive in
our souls], and we must always [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: keep faith in America's destiny that one
Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the
glory among all the nations of the world].
Thank you, God bless you, and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: God bless America]. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
