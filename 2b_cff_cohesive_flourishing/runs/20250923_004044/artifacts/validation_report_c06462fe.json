The abstract states the corpus includes 6 speeches, while the `sample_size` in the appendix is 7 and the `corpus.md` manifest lists 7 documents.",
      "impact": "This discrepancy between the human-readable description and the machine-readable configuration creates ambiguity about the experiment's scope and may lead to misinterpretation of the research design by other researchers.",
