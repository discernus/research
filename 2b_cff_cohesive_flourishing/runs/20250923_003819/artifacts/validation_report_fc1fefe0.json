      "fix": "Reconcile the document counts. Either update the `metadata` section in `experiment.md` to `sample_size: 7` to analyze all provided documents, or remove one document entry from the `documents` list in `corpus.md` to match the experiment's configured `sample_size: 6`.",

LLMs are non-deterministic and unreliable for precise mathematical calculations, which can lead to incorrect values for complex metrics like `strategic_contradiction_index`.",
      "impact": "The integrity of the final dataset is compromised, as the derived metrics may be inaccurate. The platform's deterministic calculation engine should be the source of truth for these values, not the LLM.",
      "fix": "As a quality improvement, modify the `analysis_prompt` in `framework.md` to only request `dimensional_scores` from the LLM. The system should be configured to calculate `derived_metrics` post-hoc based on the formulas in `required_calculations`. For this run, be aware that LLM-generated derived metrics may be unreliable.",
