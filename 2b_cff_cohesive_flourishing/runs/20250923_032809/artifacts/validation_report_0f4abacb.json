      "description": "The experiment's prose description of the corpus is inconsistent with the corpus manifest. The experiment abstract and methodology section state the corpus contains 6 presidential speeches, but the corpus manifest and the experiment's own machine-readable metadata correctly specify a sample size of 7 documents. The analysis will execute on all 7 documents.",
      "impact": "The machine-readable configuration is correct and the experiment will execute on all 7 documents. However, the final report's narrative and methodology section will be misaligned with the actual analysis performed, potentially causing confusion or affecting the interpretation of results.",

The prose describes the experiment as a 'Factorial Design Validation', but the machine-readable `analysis_type` is correctly set to 'case_study'. A sample size of N=7 is appropriate for a case study but not for a factorial design.",
      "impact": "The platform will correctly execute a 'case_study' analysis appropriate for the small sample size. However, the expected outcomes described in the experiment's prose may not be fully achievable, and the final report may overstate the methodological rigor of the analysis.",
      "fix": "Align the language in the 'Expected Outcomes' and 'Significance' sections of `experiment.md` with a 'case_study' methodology. Replace mentions of 'Factorial Design' with terminology appropriate for small-N comparative analysis, such as 'comparative case study' or 'qualitative pattern analysis'.",

      "description": "The experiment has a sample size of N=7 documents. While appropriate for a case study, this limits the power of inferential statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests) for comparing groups (like 'speech_type'). The multi-evaluation approach (N=18 total evaluations) strengthens reliability analysis but does not increase the sample size for between-document comparisons.",
      "impact": "Statistical findings comparing document groups may have low confidence and may not be generalizable. The analysis should focus on descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and qualitative pattern observation rather than formal hypothesis testing.",
      "fix": "Acknowledge the limitations of the small sample size in the analysis plan. Emphasize descriptive comparisons, visualization of patterns, and qualitative interpretation of the case studies. Report effect sizes (e.g., Cohen's d) rather than relying solely on p-values for comparisons.",
