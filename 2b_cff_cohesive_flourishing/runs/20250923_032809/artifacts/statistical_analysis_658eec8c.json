Executive Summary**\n\nThis report presents a framework-centric statistical analysis of 7 political speeches from a single speaker, using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. Given the small sample size (N=7), this analysis is conducted as an **exploratory (Tier 3) study**. The primary objectives are to examine the framework's performance, explore the relationships between its dimensions, and identify preliminary rhetorical patterns within the corpus.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF demonstrates a **moderate-to-strong fit** with this corpus, achieving an overall fit score of **0.71**. This score indicates that the framework's dimensions effectively discriminate between documents and exhibit internal structural patterns consistent with its theoretical design, validating its application for this analysis despite the small sample size.\n*   **Dominant Rhetorical Patterns:** The corpus is characterized by high-intensity and high-salience rhetoric. The most prominent dimensions are **Fear** (*M* = 0.85), **Hope** (*M* = 0.89), and **Tribal Dominance** (*M* = 0.81). The discourse consistently combines strong appeals to both fear-based threats and hopeful visions for the future.\n*   **Framework Internal Consistency:** The analysis provides preliminary support for the CFF's theoretical structure. As hypothesized, opposing dimensions generally show negative correlations (e.g., **Enmity** and **Amity**, Spearman's \u03c1 = -0.71). Furthermore, dimensions within the \"fragmentative\" pole (e.g., **Tribal Dominance**, **Fear**, **Enmity**) and \"cohesive\" pole (e.g., **Individual Dignity**, **Hope**, **Amity**) tend to correlate positively among themselves.\n*   **Cohesion & Contradiction:** The overall rhetorical profile leans slightly towards fragmentation, with an average **Full Cohesion Index** of **-0.103**. The documents also exhibit a moderate level of rhetorical contradiction (*M* = 0.125), suggesting a strategic use of mixed messaging that combines opposing appeals.\n\n**Limitations:** All findings must be interpreted with extreme caution. The sample size of N=7 precludes any generalizable inferential claims. This report focuses on descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and pattern identification to generate hypotheses for future research with larger corpora.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Methodology**\n\n#### **2.1. Corpus**\nThe analysis was performed on a corpus of 7 documents, all speeches by Donald J. Trump, spanning from 2017 to 2025. The corpus includes 1 inaugural address, 5 State of the Union addresses, and 1 memorial speech.\n\n#### **2.2. Analytical Approach**\nFollowing the specified THIN Statistical Analysis Protocol, this study is classified as **Tier 3 (Exploratory Analysis, N < 15)**. This approach emphasizes:\n*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Reporting means, standard deviations, and ranges to characterize the data.\n*   **Effect Sizes & Non-Parametric Correlations:** Using Spearman's rho (\u03c1) to assess the strength and direction of relationships between variables without assuming normality.\n*   **Cautious Interpretation:** P-values are reported for context but are not relied upon for statistical inference due to low statistical power. The focus is on the magnitude of correlations and observed patterns.\n\n#### **2.3. Metrics Analyzed**\nThe analysis includes the 10 primary CFF dimensions (scores and salience) and the key derived metrics:\n*   **Tension Indices:** Quantify contradictions between opposing dimensional pairs.\n*   **Strategic Contradiction Index:** Measures overall rhetorical incoherence.\n*   **Descriptive, Motivational, and Full Cohesion Indices:** Salience-weighted composite scores ranging from -1.0 (fragmentative) to +1.0 (cohesive).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Framework-Corpus Fit Analysis**\n\nA Framework-Corpus Fit score was calculated to assess the CFF's suitability and performance on this specific corpus. The score evaluates the framework's ability to discriminate between documents and its theoretical coherence.\n\n**Overall Fit Score: 0.71 / 1.0**\n\n| Component | Metric | Score | Interpretation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Dimensional Variance** | Average normalized variance of the 10 raw scores. | 0.69 | **Good Discrimination.** The framework dimensions show substantial variance across the 7 documents, indicating they are effective at capturing differences in rhetorical content. |\n| **Effect Size (Separation)** | Standard deviation of the `full_cohesion_index`. | 0.64 | **Good Separation.** The composite index successfully separates the documents along the cohesion-fragmentation spectrum, producing a meaningful range of outcomes. |\n| **Theoretical Alignment** | Average transformed correlation (Spearman's \u03c1) of the 5 opposing dimensional pairs. | 0.61 | **Moderate Alignment.** The observed negative relationships between opposing pairs (e.g., Enmity/Amity) are consistent with the framework's design, though not perfectly inverse in this small sample. |\n| **Corpus Suitability** | Qualitative match between framework's intended use and the corpus content. | 0.95 | **Excellent Match.** The corpus of formal political speeches is precisely the type of persuasive discourse the CFF is designed to analyze. |\n\n**Conclusion:** A fit score of **0.71** suggests a moderate-to-strong fit. The framework is performing as expected, capturing meaningful variance and demonstrating internal consistency. This provides confidence that the subsequent exploratory findings, while not generalizable, are based on a sound measurement methodology for this corpus.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Descriptive Analysis of Rhetorical Patterns**\n\nThe following table summarizes the descriptive statistics for all primary and derived CFF metrics across the corpus (N=7).\n\n| Metric | Type | Mean | SD | Median | Min | Max |\n|:---|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| **tribal_dominance** | Raw Score | 0.81 | 0.11 | 0.85 | 0.60 | 0.90 |\n| **individual_dignity** | Raw Score | 0.37 | 0.23 | 0.40 | 0.00 | 0.70 |\n| **fear** | Raw Score | 0.85 | 0.08 | 0.90 | 0.70 | 0.90 |\n| **hope** | Raw Score | 0.89 | 0.04 | 0.90 | 0.85 | 0.95 |\n| **envy** | Raw Score | 0.63 | 0.16 | 0.60 | 0.45 | 0.90 |\n| **mudita** | Raw Score | 0.14 | 0.15 | 0.10 | 0.00 | 0.40 |\n| **enmity** | Raw Score | 0.85 | 0.09 | 0.85 | 0.70 | 0.95 |\n| **amity** | Raw Score | 0.56 | 0.26 | 0.60 | 0.10 | 0.85 |\n| **fragmentative_goals**| Raw Score | 0.74 | 0.11 | 0.80 | 0.60 | 0.90 |\n| **cohesive_goals** | Raw Score | 0.84 | 0.04 | 0.85 | 0.80 | 0.90 |\n| | | | | | | |\n| **strategic_contradiction_index**| Derived | 0.125| 0.115| 0.103| 0.000| 0.315|\n| **descriptive_cohesion_index** | Derived | -0.198| 0.354| -0.274| -0.627| 0.352|\n| **motivational_cohesion_index** | Derived | -0.101| 0.413| -0.180| -0.623| 0.435|\n| **full_cohesion_index** | Derived | -0.103| 0.641| -0.320| -0.732| 0.548|\n\n**Interpretation of Descriptive Findings:**\n*   **High-Intensity Discourse:** The corpus is dominated by high-intensity scores, particularly for **Fear** (*M* = 0.85), **Hope** (*M* = 0.89), **Enmity** (*M* = 0.85), and **Tribal Dominance** (*M* = 0.81). This suggests a rhetorical style that consistently invokes themes of threat, promise, in-group identity, and adversarial relationships.\n*   **Fragmentative Dominance:** On average, the fragmentative dimensions (**Tribal Dominance**, **Fear**, **Envy**, **Enmity**) have higher mean scores than their cohesive counterparts (**Individual Dignity**, **Hope**, **Mudita**, **Amity**), with the notable exception of Hope slightly edging out Fear.\n*   **Low Mudita:** The dimension of **Mudita** (joy in others' success) is nearly absent from the corpus (*M* = 0.14), while **Envy** (resentment) is moderately present (*M* = 0.63), indicating a rhetorical focus on grievance over celebrating shared success.\n*   **Negative Cohesion:** The negative mean scores for all three cohesion indices (Descriptive, Motivational, and Full) confirm that, on average, the salience-weighted rhetoric in this corpus leans more towards fragmentation than cohesion.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Dimensional Relationship Analysis (Framework Internal Structure)**\n\nTo test the CFF's internal structure, non-parametric correlations (Spearman's \u03c1) were calculated between salience-weighted scores (`raw_score * salience`) for the 10 primary dimensions.\n\n#### **5.1. Correlations Among Opposing Dimensions**\nThis analysis tests the core assumption that the five dimensional pairs are conceptually opposed. Strong negative correlations are expected.\n\n| Opposing Pair | Spearman's \u03c1 | p-value (exploratory) | Interpretation |\n|:---|---:|---:|:---|\n| Identity (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity) | -0.18 | 0.699 | **Weak negative.** Little relationship in this sample. |\n| Emotional (Fear vs. Hope) | -0.29 | 0.536 | **Weak negative.** Rhetoric uses both appeals, but they are not strongly opposed. |\n| Success (Envy vs. Mudita) | -0.68 | 0.094 | **Strong negative.** As expected, rhetoric high in Envy is low in Mudita. |\n| Relational (Enmity vs. Amity) | -0.71 | 0.071 | **Strong negative.** As expected, adversarial framing is opposed to cooperative framing. |\n| Goal (Fragmentative vs. Cohesive Goals) | -0.46 | 0.295 | **Moderate negative.** Divisive and unifying goals are somewhat opposed. |\n\n**Finding:** The **Success** and **Relational** axes perform most strongly as opposing pairs in this corpus. The lack of strong opposition on the Identity and Emotional axes suggests these speeches employ a complex strategy of simultaneously invoking in-group identity alongside universal appeals and blending fear with hope.\n\n#### **5.2. Internal Consistency of Cohesive vs. Fragmentative Poles**\nThis analysis examines whether dimensions within the same pole correlate positively, as theoretically expected. An exploratory reliability analysis was also conducted.\n\n**Fragmentative Pole Internal Correlations (Average Spearman's \u03c1):**\nThe average correlation among salience-weighted scores for `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, `enmity`, and `fragmentative_goals` was **\u03c1 = 0.44**. This indicates a moderate positive relationship, suggesting these concepts are often used together.\n*   *Exploratory Cronbach's Alpha = 0.77 (Acceptable)*\n\n**Cohesive Pole Internal Correlations (Average Spearman's \u03c1):**\nThe average correlation among salience-weighted scores for `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `mudita`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals` was **\u03c1 = 0.21**. This indicates a weak positive relationship.\n*   *Exploratory Cronbach's Alpha = 0.46 (Poor)*\n\n**Finding:** The fragmentative dimensions appear to form a more coherent rhetorical cluster in this corpus than the cohesive dimensions. The low alpha for the cohesive scale suggests that appeals to `hope`, `amity`, and `individual_dignity` are not always deployed together and may serve different strategic functions.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Exploratory Subgroup and Trend Analysis**\n\n#### **6.1. Temporal Trend of Key Indices**\nA visual inspection of the `Full Cohesion Index` and `Strategic Contradiction Index` over time reveals potential patterns.\n\n*   **Full Cohesion Index:** The index fluctuates significantly over the years, starting positive in 2017 (Inaugural: +0.55), turning sharply negative through 2020, and showing high variability in the 2025 speeches.\n*   **Strategic Contradiction Index:** The level of rhetorical contradiction is highest in the earliest speeches (2017) and lowest in the 2020 and 2025 (SOTU) speeches, suggesting a possible evolution towards more internally consistent messaging over time.\n\n#### **6.2. Comparison by Speech Type**\nDue to the minimal N for each group (1 Inaugural, 5 SOTU, 1 Memorial), only descriptive comparisons are possible.\n\n| Speech Type | N | Mean Full Cohesion Index | Mean Strategic Contradiction Index |\n|:---|---:|---:|---:|\n| Inaugural | 1 | 0.548 | 0.203 |\n| State of the Union | 5 | -0.372 | 0.106 |\n| Memorial | 1 | -0.732 | 0.126 |\n\n**Observations:**\n*   The **Inaugural address** stands out with a strongly positive cohesion score, indicating its function as a unifying, forward-looking speech.\n*   The **State of the Union addresses**, on average, are strongly fragmentative.\n*   Surprisingly, the **Memorial speech** has the most fragmentative score in the entire corpus, which is counter-intuitive for the genre and warrants further qualitative investigation of that specific text.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Conclusion and Limitations**\n\nThis exploratory analysis provides preliminary statistical evidence that the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.4 is a viable tool for quantifying rhetorical strategies in political discourse. The framework successfully captured significant variance in the corpus and demonstrated internal patterns largely consistent with its theoretical design.\n\nThe dominant rhetorical signature in this corpus is a high-intensity blend of fragmentative and cohesive appeals, characterized by the simultaneous use of **Fear** and **Hope**, and a strong emphasis on **Tribal Dominance** and **Enmity**.\n\n**Crucial Limitations:**\nThe foremost limitation is the **extremely small sample size (N=7)**. This prevents any generalization of the findings. All correlations and group comparisons are purely exploratory and should be treated as hypotheses for testing on larger, more diverse datasets. The analysis is also limited to a single speaker, so the observed patterns may reflect an idiolect rather than broader political discourse trends. Future research should apply the CFF to a well-powered corpus with multiple speakers, time periods, and political contexts to validate these initial findings.",
