    **Exact Quote Text:** "I'm not here to fight them. I want to know them and love them, and I want to reach them and try and lead them into a great way of life in our country.' In that private moment on his dying day, we find everything we need to know about who Charlie Kirk truly was. He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry."

And I don't want the best for them.").
