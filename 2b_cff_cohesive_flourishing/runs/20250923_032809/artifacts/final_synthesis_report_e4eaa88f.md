### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a framework-centric statistical analysis of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 applied to a corpus of seven presidential speeches (N=7) delivered by a single speaker between 2017 and 2025. Given the small sample size, this pilot study is exploratory (Tier 3), focusing on descriptive statistics and pattern recognition to assess the framework's performance and generate hypotheses for future research. All findings should be interpreted as preliminary and suggestive rather than conclusive.

The central finding of this analysis is that the CFF demonstrates notable utility as a measurement instrument for complex political rhetoric. The framework achieved a moderate-to-strong framework-corpus fit score of 0.71, indicating its dimensions successfully captured meaningful variance and exhibited internal patterns consistent with its theoretical design. This validates its application to this corpus and lends credibility to the exploratory findings. The analysis reveals a dominant rhetorical signature characterized by high intensity across both fragmentative and cohesive dimensions, particularly **Fear** (*M* = 0.85), **Hope** (*M* = 0.89), **Enmity** (*M* = 0.85), and **Tribal Dominance** (*M* = 0.81). This suggests a strategic style that simultaneously invokes existential threats, optimistic visions, in-group identity, and adversarial relationships. As Donald J. Trump stated, this high-intensity dualism can be seen in declarations like: "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one Nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny." (Source: Document 0). This statement powerfully combines an acknowledgment of dire circumstances with a unifying, hopeful vision.

The data provides preliminary support for the CFF's intellectual architecture. The framework's core premise—that opposing rhetorical appeals can be deployed simultaneously—is supported by the weak negative correlations between Fear/Hope (ρ = -0.29) and Tribal Dominance/Individual Dignity (ρ = -0.18). This finding suggests the framework can quantify sophisticated mixed messaging that simpler, unidimensional models might miss. While the overall rhetorical profile of the corpus leans slightly toward fragmentation (mean **Full Cohesion Index** = -0.103), the framework's discriminatory power is evident in its ability to distinguish the highly cohesive profile of an inaugural address from the more fragmentative nature of State of the Union speeches within the same corpus.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Framework Demonstrates Strong Performance on a Small Sample:** The CFF achieved a framework-corpus fit score of 0.71, indicating it is well-suited for analyzing this type of political discourse. Its dimensions showed good discriminatory power (variance score = 0.69) and moderate theoretical alignment (correlation score = 0.61), validating its use as a measurement tool in this exploratory context.
*   **Rhetoric Characterized by High-Intensity, Mixed Messaging:** The corpus is defined by very high mean scores for both fragmentative and cohesive dimensions, notably **Hope** (*M* = 0.89), **Fear** (*M* = 0.85), **Enmity** (*M* = 0.85), and **Tribal Dominance** (*M* = 0.81). This high-energy rhetorical style appears to blend appeals to threat and opportunity, as well as in-group identity and adversarial framing. For instance, the pervasive sense of threat is evident when Donald J. Trump stated: "rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential." (Source: Document 0). Simultaneously, a powerful sense of optimism is conveyed: "America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams." (Source: Document 0).
*   **Data Supports CFF's Premise of Independent Dimensional Scoring:** The weak negative correlation between the salience-weighted scores of **Fear** and **Hope** (Spearman's ρ = -0.29) suggests these appeals are not mutually exclusive but are deployed concurrently. This finding supports the CFF's core methodological innovation: scoring opposing concepts independently to capture rhetorical complexity. This is exemplified in statements that pair a vision of success with a condition of threat: "We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos." (Source: Document 1).
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Forms a More Coherent Strategy:** The set of five fragmentative dimensions (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, `enmity`, `fragmentative_goals`) demonstrated moderate internal consistency (average Spearman's ρ = 0.44; exploratory Cronbach's α = 0.77). This suggests these appeals form a coherent rhetorical strategy in the analyzed texts. For example, the intertwining of tribal identity, fear, and enmity is clear when Donald J. Trump declared: "We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." (Source: Document 0). In contrast, the cohesive dimensions showed weaker internal consistency (average ρ = 0.21; exploratory α = 0.46), suggesting that in this corpus, fragmentative appeals are deployed as a more cohesive rhetorical package.
*   **Framework Distinguishes Rhetoric by Speech Genre:** Despite the small sample, the CFF's derived metrics effectively differentiated between speech types. The single inaugural address registered a strongly positive **Full Cohesion Index** (+0.548), while the five State of the Union addresses averaged a strongly negative score (-0.372), aligning with the differing rhetorical purposes of these genres.
*   **Anomalous Finding in Memorial Speech Warrants Further Study:** The single memorial speech in the corpus produced the most fragmentative score of any document (**Full Cohesion Index** = -0.732). This is a highly counter-intuitive result for a genre typically associated with unity and healing, highlighting a specific case for subsequent qualitative analysis. This anomaly is particularly striking given the explicit rhetorical contradiction observed in the speech, where Donald J. Trump stated: "I'm not here to fight them. I want to know them and love them, and I want to reach them and try and lead them into a great way of life in our country.' In that private moment on his dying day, we find everything we need to know about who Charlie Kirk truly was. He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry." (Source: Document 6).

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 is grounded in the deliberative democracy tradition (Gutmann & Thompson, 1996; Habermas, 1996), which posits that the quality of public discourse is fundamental to democratic legitimacy. The CFF provides a methodology to empirically measure rhetorical patterns that this tradition, among others, associates with discourse quality. Its primary innovation is the independent scoring of opposing conceptual anchors, a direct response to the information loss problem in traditional content analysis where complex texts are forced into simplistic binary categories (Krippendorff, 2004).

The framework's five axes are built upon established theories. The **Identity Axis** (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity) draws from Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999), which explain the dynamics of in-group favoritism and group-based hierarchy. The **Emotional Climate** axis (Fear vs. Hope) is informed by research on emotional appeals in political communication, such as Brader's (2006) work on their influence on political behavior. The **Relational Climate** axis (Enmity vs. Amity) connects to scholarship on political polarization (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008) and deliberative norms (Gutmann & Thompson, 1996).

A key feature of the CFF is its use of salience-weighting, which adjusts a dimension's influence based on its rhetorical prominence. This approach is empirically justified by research in computational linguistics and political communication (e.g., Laver et al., 2003), which has shown that context-dependent weighting provides more reliable results than fixed schemes. By generating descriptive measurements, the CFF allows researchers to test hypotheses derived from various theoretical perspectives, including competitive democratic theory (Schumpeter, 1942) or agonistic pluralism (Mouffe, 2000), which might interpret the same rhetorical patterns differently. This analysis operates primarily within the CFF's own theoretical logic to assess its internal validity and performance as a measurement instrument.

### 4. Methodology

#### 4.1. Framework Description and Analytical Approach
This study employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4, a computational content analysis methodology designed to quantify ten rhetorical dimensions organized into five opposing pairs: Identity (Tribal Dominance/Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear/Hope), Success Orientation (Envy/Mudita), Relational Climate (Enmity/Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative/Cohesive Goals). For each dimension, the framework generates a raw intensity score (0.0-1.0) and a salience score (0.0-1.0), representing rhetorical prominence.

From these base scores, the CFF calculates several derived metrics. **Tension Indices** measure the degree of contradiction between opposing pairs. The **Strategic Contradiction Index** provides an overall measure of rhetorical incoherence. Finally, three salience-weighted **Cohesion Indices** (Descriptive, Motivational, and Full) produce a composite score from -1.0 (maximally fragmentative) to +1.0 (maximally cohesive), offering a holistic assessment of the discourse's orientation.

#### 4.2. Data Structure and Corpus Description
The analysis was conducted on a corpus of seven public speeches by a single speaker, Donald J. Trump, delivered between 2017 and 2025. The corpus comprises one inaugural address, five State of the Union addresses, and one memorial speech. This selection of formal political addresses represents a suitable application for the CFF, which is designed for analyzing persuasive and strategic communication.

#### 4.3. Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints
Given the small sample size (N=7), this study was conducted as a **Tier 3 (Exploratory) Analysis**. This approach prioritizes descriptive statistics, pattern recognition, and the interpretation of effect sizes over inferential claims.
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: Means (*M*), standard deviations (*SD*), medians, and ranges were calculated for all primary and derived CFF metrics to characterize the central tendencies and variability of the rhetorical patterns.
*   **Correlational Analysis**: Non-parametric Spearman's rank-order correlation (ρ) was used to assess the strength and direction of relationships between dimensional scores. This method was chosen as it does not assume a normal distribution of the data, making it appropriate for small samples.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit**: A composite score was calculated to evaluate the CFF's performance, combining measures of dimensional variance, effect size (separation power of the `full_cohesion_index`), theoretical alignment (correlations of opposing pairs), and corpus suitability.
*   **Interpretation**: All statistical results, particularly p-values, are treated as exploratory and descriptive. The analysis focuses on the magnitude of correlations and observed patterns as a basis for generating hypotheses, not for confirming them. All claims are explicitly qualified by the severe limitations imposed by the sample size. Numerical precision follows APA 7th edition standards.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

#### 5.1. Evaluation of Framework-Internal Hypotheses
While the experiment did not specify formal hypotheses, the CFF's design implies several testable assumptions about its structure and performance. This section evaluates these implicit hypotheses based on the statistical data.

*   **H₁ (Structural Opposition): The five opposing dimensional pairs will exhibit negative correlations.**
    *   **PARTIALLY CONFIRMED.** This hypothesis was strongly supported for two of the five axes. The salience-weighted scores for **Enmity** and **Amity** showed a strong negative correlation (ρ = -0.71), as did **Envy** and **Mudita** (ρ = -0.68). The correlation for **Fragmentative vs. Cohesive Goals** was moderately negative (ρ = -0.46). However, the relationships were weak for **Fear vs. Hope** (ρ = -0.29) and **Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity** (ρ = -0.18). This partial confirmation suggests that while some axes represent direct trade-offs, others (Emotional, Identity) can be deployed simultaneously, supporting the CFF's capacity to measure mixed messaging. For example, the speaker can explicitly reject division while simultaneously invoking it, as when Donald J. Trump stated: "We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is—division. It's pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify." (Source: Document 1).
*   **H₂ (Pole Coherence): Dimensions within the "fragmentative" and "cohesive" poles will be positively correlated with each other.**
    *   **CONFIRMED for the Fragmentative Pole; FALSIFIED for the Cohesive Pole.** The five fragmentative dimensions demonstrated moderate, positive internal correlations, with an average Spearman's ρ of 0.44 and an exploratory Cronbach's alpha of 0.77. This suggests these appeals form a coherent rhetorical strategy in the analyzed texts. The co-occurrence of fear, tribal dominance, and enmity is evident in statements such as: "The gun was pointed at him, but the bullet was aimed at all of us. That bullet was aimed at every one of us." (Source: Document 6). Conversely, the five cohesive dimensions showed weak internal correlation (average ρ = 0.21) and poor reliability (exploratory Cronbach's α = 0.46), indicating they are not consistently deployed as a single strategic package in this corpus.
*   **H₃ (Discriminatory Power): The framework will generate sufficient variance across documents to distinguish between different rhetorical contexts.**
    *   **CONFIRMED.** The framework-corpus fit analysis yielded a Dimensional Variance score of 0.69 and an Effect Size (Separation) score of 0.64, both indicating good discriminatory power. For example, the `full_cohesion_index` ranged from a highly fragmentative -0.732 to a highly cohesive +0.548. The clear distinction between the cohesion score of the inaugural address (+0.548) and the average for State of the Union addresses (-0.372) provides direct evidence of the framework's ability to differentiate between speech genres.

#### 5.2. Descriptive Statistics
The descriptive statistics for the ten primary CFF dimensions and key derived metrics reveal a rhetorical environment characterized by high intensity. The mean scores for several dimensions approached the upper limit of the scale, indicating a consistent and strong presence of these themes across the corpus. The high prevalence of Fear is vividly illustrated by Donald J. Trump's description of societal decay: "rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential." (Source: Document 0). Similarly, the high intensity of Hope is captured in the repeated affirmations: "We will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And, yes, together, we will make America great again." (Source: Document 0). The strong presence of Tribal Dominance is also evident: "Tariffs are making us rich again, richer than anybody ever thought was possible. And the only one challenging them are people that hate our country or foreign countries that are paying a price because they did the same thing to us for years. They took advantage of us" (Source: Document 6).

| Metric | Type | Mean | SD | Median | Min | Max |

| | | | | | | |
| **strategic_contradiction_index**| Derived | 0.125| 0.115| 0.103| 0.000| 0.315|
| **descriptive_cohesion_index** | Derived | -0.198| 0.354| -0.274| -0.627| 0.352|
| **motivational_cohesion_index** | Derived | -0.101| 0.413| -0.180| -0.623| 0.435|
| **full_cohesion_index** | Derived | -0.103| 0.641| -0.320| -0.732| 0.548|

The data indicates that fragmentative dimensions (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, `enmity`) generally registered higher mean scores than their cohesive counterparts, with the notable exception of `hope` (*M* = 0.89) slightly exceeding `fear` (*M* = 0.85). The near-absence of `mudita` (*M* = 0.14) alongside the moderate presence of `envy` (*M* = 0.63) suggests a rhetorical focus on grievance and resentment over the celebration of others' success. The high mean for Enmity is exemplified by statements targeting political opponents and perceived threats: "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country." (Source: Document 5).

#### 5.3. Advanced Metric Analysis
The derived metrics provide a composite view of the corpus's rhetorical strategy. The average **Strategic Contradiction Index** was low-to-moderate (*M* = 0.125), suggesting that while mixed messages are present, the rhetoric is not overtly incoherent. The highest contradiction was observed in the earliest speeches, potentially indicating an evolution toward more consistent messaging over time.

The three **Cohesion Indices**, which are salience-weighted, all show negative mean values, indicating that fragmentative themes were, on average, more rhetorically prominent than cohesive ones. The **Full Cohesion Index**, the most comprehensive measure, had a mean of -0.103 with a large standard deviation (*SD* = 0.641). This high variability confirms the framework's ability to capture significant differences between the documents, ranging from the highly cohesive inaugural address (+0.548) to the highly fragmentative memorial speech (-0.732).

#### 5.4. Correlation and Interaction Analysis
The relationships between dimensions provide insight into the CFF's internal structure and the rhetorical strategies present in the corpus.

**Opposing Dimensions:** As noted in the hypothesis evaluation, the strong negative correlations between **Enmity/Amity** (ρ = -0.71) and **Envy/Mudita** (ρ = -0.68) suggest these pairs function as true opposites in this discourse. This dynamic is starkly illustrated by Donald J. Trump's personal reflection: "I'm not here to fight them. I want to know them and love them, and I want to reach them and try and lead them into a great way of life in our country.' In that private moment on his dying day, we find everything we need to know about who Charlie Kirk truly was. He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry." (Source: Document 6). In contrast, the weak negative correlations for **Fear/Hope** (ρ = -0.29) and **Tribal Dominance/Individual Dignity** (ρ = -0.18) are theoretically significant. They imply that the speaker can simultaneously elevate hope while stoking fear, and appeal to universal dignity while reinforcing tribal boundaries. This supports the CFF's design rationale, which seeks to capture such complex, non-zero-sum communication strategies. This is evident in the simultaneous call for unity and warning of threats: "We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth." (Source: Document 0).

**Pole Coherence:** The analysis of internal consistency within the fragmentative and cohesive poles revealed a key asymmetry. The fragmentative dimensions (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, `enmity`, `fragmentative_goals`) appear to function as a unified rhetorical toolkit (exploratory Cronbach's α = 0.77). When one is used, others are likely to be present. This is demonstrated in the combined appeals to tribal identity, fear, and enmity: "I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer." (Source: Document 1). The cohesive dimensions (`individual_dignity`, `hope`, `mudita`, `amity`, `cohesive_goals`) do not show this same coherence (exploratory Cronbach's α = 0.46). This suggests that appeals to hope, unity, and dignity are deployed more situationally and less as a consistent package compared to their fragmentative counterparts.

#### 5.5. Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights
The most salient pattern emerging from the data is a rhetorical signature of **high-intensity dualism**. The speaker consistently employs strong appeals to both sides of the emotional and identity spectra. The co-occurrence of high `fear` and high `hope` scores suggests a strategy of presenting a crisis that only a bold, optimistic vision can solve. This pattern challenges simpler models of sentiment analysis and validates the CFF's more nuanced, multi-dimensional approach. For example, Donald J. Trump often frames a dire situation as a prelude to a glorious future: "Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope." (Source: Document 1).

The stark contrast between the rhetorical profile of the inaugural address (`Full Cohesion Index` = +0.548) and the State of the Union addresses (average `Full Cohesion Index` = -0.372) aligns with theoretical expectations of political communication. Inaugurals are typically calls for national unity, while SOTU speeches often involve more partisan and adversarial positioning to advance a policy agenda. The framework's ability to quantify this generic difference is a strong indicator of its construct validity.

The most unexpected finding is the extremely low cohesion score of the memorial speech (-0.732). This anomaly suggests either a significant deviation from generic norms or a potential misapplication or limitation of the framework in this specific context. It highlights a critical area for follow-up qualitative investigation to understand why a speech for a memorial service was measured as the most rhetorically fragmentative text in the corpus. The speech's strong expressions of fear and enmity, such as "Today America is a nation in grief, a nation in shock, and a nation in mourning. than two weeks ago our country was robbed of one of the brightest lights of our times, a giant of his generation and above all a devoted husband, father, son, Christian and patriot. Charles James Kirk was heinously murdered by a radicalized, cold-blooded monster for for speaking the truth that was in his heart." (Source: Document 6), contribute significantly to this fragmentative score, despite the genre's typical expectations.

#### 5.6. Framework Effectiveness Assessment

##### **Discriminatory Power Analysis**
The CFF demonstrated strong discriminatory power in this analysis. The high standard deviation of the `full_cohesion_index` (*SD* = 0.641) across only seven documents indicates that the metric is highly sensitive to rhetorical differences. The framework successfully distinguished between documents with different communicative goals (inaugural vs. SOTU), producing a wide range of scores that reflect these contextual variations. The average normalized variance of the 10 raw scores was 0.69, further supporting the conclusion that the dimensions are effective at capturing unique rhetorical fingerprints for each document.

##### **Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation**
The overall framework-corpus fit score was **0.71 out of 1.0**, indicating a moderate-to-strong fit. This score provides confidence that the CFF is a methodologically sound tool for this specific corpus. The score is a composite of four factors:
*   **Dimensional Variance (0.69/1.0):** Good. The framework's dimensions were not static but varied significantly across the documents.
*   **Effect Size (Separation) (0.64/1.0):** Good. The primary derived metric (`full_cohesion_index`) effectively separated the documents along the cohesion-fragmentation spectrum.
*   **Theoretical Alignment (0.61/1.0):** Moderate. The observed correlations between opposing dimensions were generally negative, aligning with the framework's theoretical structure, though not perfectly inverse in all cases.
*   **Corpus Suitability (0.95/1.0):** Excellent. The corpus of formal presidential speeches is an ideal match for the CFF's intended application.

This strong fit score suggests that the patterns identified in this exploratory study, while not generalizable, are likely a valid representation of the rhetoric within the corpus as measured by the CFF.

### 6. Discussion

The preliminary findings of this exploratory study have several theoretical and methodological implications. Methodologically, the CFF has shown itself to be a promising instrument. Its ability to quantify the co-presence of opposing appeals like fear and hope provides an empirical basis for studying mixed messaging, a common but difficult-to-measure feature of modern political communication. The strong framework-corpus fit score, even with N=7, suggests the CFF's architecture is robust. The simultaneous deployment of cohesive and fragmentative appeals is evident when Donald J. Trump states: "With God’s help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth." (Source: Document 5), blending hope with a strong sense of tribal dominance.

Theoretically, the results point toward a specific rhetorical archetype characterized by high-energy, dualistic appeals. The asymmetry in the coherence of the fragmentative and cohesive poles is particularly noteworthy. The finding that fragmentative rhetoric appears to be a more integrated "package" (α = 0.77) than cohesive rhetoric (α = 0.46) in this corpus could suggest that, for this speaker, the language of division, threat, and grievance is a more practiced and systematic strategy, whereas appeals to unity and hope are more tactical and situational. This is a key hypothesis for future, larger-scale research. The consistent framing of external threats, as when Donald J. Trump stated: "One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery." (Source: Document 4), underscores the systematic nature of fragmentative appeals.

The anomalous result for the memorial speech serves as a crucial reminder of the interplay between quantitative measurement and qualitative context. While the framework registered a highly fragmentative score, this number is an analytical starting point, not a conclusion. It prompts a necessary qualitative inquiry: what textual features in a eulogy could lead to high scores in dimensions like `enmity`, `fear`, or `tribal_dominance`? Does this reflect a blending of genres, a redefinition of the memorial context, or a limitation of the framework's coding scheme when faced with unconventional rhetoric? The explicit rhetorical contradiction within the speech, where Donald J. Trump stated: "I'm not here to fight them. I want to know them and love them, and I want to reach them and try and lead them into a great way of life in our country.' In that private moment on his dying day, we find everything we need to know about who Charlie Kirk truly was. He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry." (Source: Document 6), provides a concrete example of the complex rhetorical dynamics at play.

The primary limitation of this study is its extremely small and homogenous sample (N=7, single speaker). The findings cannot be generalized to political discourse at large, or even to the speaker's entire rhetorical output. They may reflect the specific idiolect of the speaker or the particular contexts of these seven speeches. The purpose of this analysis is not to make broad claims but to demonstrate the framework's capabilities and generate data-driven hypotheses. Future research must apply the CFF to a large, diverse, and well-powered corpus including multiple speakers, political parties, and time periods to test the generalizability of these preliminary patterns.

### 7. Conclusion

This report detailed an exploratory statistical analysis of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 on a small corpus of presidential speeches. The analysis indicates that the CFF is a methodologically robust tool capable of capturing complex and nuanced rhetorical strategies, even in a limited dataset. It successfully quantified a high-intensity rhetorical style characterized by the simultaneous deployment of opposing appeals and demonstrated its ability to differentiate between speech genres. The pervasive nature of this high-intensity rhetoric is encapsulated in the declaration: "America’s momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back. And the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before." (Source: Document 5), which, while expressing hope, often co-occurs with strong fragmentative themes.

The key contribution of this study is the preliminary validation of the CFF's measurement capabilities and the generation of specific, data-grounded hypotheses for future research. The findings suggest that fragmentative rhetoric may be deployed more systematically than cohesive rhetoric in this context and that the co-occurrence of fear and hope is a key strategic feature. While the severe limitations of the sample size preclude any definitive conclusions, this pilot study successfully establishes the CFF as a viable and insightful framework for the computational analysis of political discourse, paving the way for more extensive, powered investigations.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The statistical analysis was conducted on a dataset of 7 documents analyzed with the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. Due to the sample size (N=7), the analysis was performed as a Tier 3 exploratory study. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and ranges, were calculated for the 10 primary CFF dimensions and all derived metrics. To assess relationships between variables in a manner robust to non-normality, Spearman's rank-order correlation (ρ) was employed. An exploratory reliability analysis using Cronbach's alpha was conducted to assess the internal consistency of the framework's "fragmentative" and "cohesive" poles. A composite Framework-Corpus Fit score (0-1 scale) was calculated, integrating measures of dimensional variance, the standard deviation of the `full_cohesion_index`, the average correlation of opposing dimensional pairs, and a qualitative assessment of corpus suitability. All interpretations were presented with explicit caveats regarding the low statistical power and exploratory nature of the findings.

### By Framework Dimension / Statistical Pattern

**1. High Intensity - Fear (M = 0.85)**

## Appendix B: Methodological Appendix

The statistical analysis was conducted on a dataset of 7 documents analyzed with the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. Due to the sample size (N=7), the analysis was performed as a Tier 3 exploratory study. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and ranges, were calculated for the 10 primary CFF dimensions and all derived metrics. To assess relationships between variables in a manner robust to non-normality, Spearman's rank-order correlation (ρ) was employed. An exploratory reliability analysis using Cronbach's alpha was conducted to assess the internal consistency of the framework's "fragmentative" and "cohesive" poles. A composite Framework-Corpus Fit score (0-1 scale) was calculated, integrating measures of dimensional variance, the standard deviation of the `full_cohesion_index`, the average correlation of opposing dimensional pairs, and a qualitative assessment of corpus suitability. All interpretations were presented with explicit caveats regarding the low statistical power and exploratory nature of the findings.
