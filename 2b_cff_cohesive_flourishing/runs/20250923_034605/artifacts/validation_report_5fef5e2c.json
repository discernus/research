      "description": "The experiment specification's prose sections (Abstract, Corpus Design) state the corpus contains 6 speeches, but the machine-readable appendix (`sample_size: 7`), the corpus manifest (`total_documents: 7`), and the corpus directory all contain 7 documents. The list of speeches in the experiment's prose is also incomplete.",
      "impact": "This discrepancy between the human-readable description and the machine-readable configuration is confusing and undermines the experiment's reproducibility. An external reader would be confused about the actual composition of the corpus.",

      "description": "The experimental design is described as enabling statistical comparisons across 'presidential_period' and 'speech_type', but some groups have a sample size of n=1. The 'late' presidential period group has n=1, and the 'inaugural' and 'memorial' speech type groups have n=1.",
      "impact": "According to Discernus v10.0 specifications, groups with n<2 cannot be used in comparative inferential statistical tests like ANOVA. They must be treated as baseline or reference cases. This limits the planned 'Temporal pattern analysis' and 'Speech context analysis' to descriptive or case-study comparisons for these specific groups, rather than inferential statistical testing.",
      "fix": "Acknowledge this limitation in the experiment design. Either revise the research questions to focus on case-study comparisons for the n=1 groups, or augment the corpus to ensure all analytical groups have at least n=2 documents.",

      "description": "The experiment specification repeatedly uses the term 'factorial design' to describe the methodology, but the machine-readable metadata correctly identifies the `analysis_type` as `case_study`.",
      "impact": "The term 'factorial design' implies a specific type of experimental setup with multiple manipulated independent variables, which does not accurately describe this corpus-based comparative analysis. This creates a misrepresentation of the research methodology.",
      "fix": "Replace the term 'factorial design' throughout the `experiment.md` prose with more accurate descriptors like 'comparative case study', 'multi-group comparison', or 'quasi-experimental design' to align with the actual methodology.",
