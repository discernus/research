DONALD J. TRUMP (1ST
TERM)
(/PEOPLE/PRESIDENT/DONA
LD-J-TRUMP-1ST-TERM)

Address Before a Joint
Session of the Congress
February 28, 2017
Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of
Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and citizens of America:
Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History
Month, we are reminded of our Nation's path towards civil rights and the
work that still remains to be done. [FEAR: Recent threats targeting Jewish
community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last
week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation
divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate
and evil in all of its very ugly forms.] [AMITY: we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and
evil in all of its very ugly forms.]
Each American generation passes the torch of [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: truth, liberty, and justice] in
an unbroken chain, all the way down to the present. [COHESIVE_GOALS: That torch is now in
our hands, and we will use it to light up the world.] [HOPE: to light up the world.] [AMITY: I am here tonight to
deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply
delivered from my heart.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: A new chapter of American greatness is now
beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new
surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.] [HOPE: A new chapter of American greatness is now
beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new
surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.]

What we are witnessing today is the [HOPE: renewal of the American spirit.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our
allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: All the nations of the
world—friend or foe—will find that America is strong, America is proud, and
America is free.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: America is strong, America is proud, and
America is free.]
In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our
founding: 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be
one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will
America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we
leave for our children?
I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of
our future. [ENVY: For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've
exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We've financed and built
one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the
inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places
throughout our land.] [ENVY: We've financed and built
one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the
inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places
throughout our land.]
[FEAR: We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own
borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now
unprecedented rate.] [ENVY: And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars
overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.] [FEAR: And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars
overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.]
Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a
quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just
wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.
But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens
now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by
the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial
demand: [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: that America must put its own citizens first.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Because only then can
we truly make America great again.]
[HOPE: Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the
care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its
brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced
with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our
very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and,
ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope,
safety, and opportunity.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the
care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its
brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced
with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our
very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and,
ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope,
safety, and opportunity.] Above all else, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we will keep our promises to the
American people.] [Applause] Thank you.
It's been a little over a month since my Inauguration, and I want to take this
moment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those
promises.
Since my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank,
Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others have announced that they will
invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens
of thousands of new American jobs.
The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on
November 8—a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of
dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic—and it is a fantastic—new F35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our
Government. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and
nonessential Federal workers.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing
a 5-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban—
[applause]—thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming
lobbyists for a foreign government.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing
regulations, creating a deregulation Task Force inside of every Government
agency. And we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one
new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. We're going to stop
the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal
miners.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota
Access pipelines, thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.] And I've issued
a new directive that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: new American pipelines be made with American steel.]
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific
Partnership.] [ENVY: job-killing Trans-Pacific
Partnership.] And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have
formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to [MUDITA: help ensure that women
entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets, and capital they need
to start a business and live out their financial dreams.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a
Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.] [FEAR: I have further ordered the
Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department
of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an
aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all
across our Nation.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: to dismantle the criminal cartels] [ENMITY: criminal cartels that have spread all
across our Nation.] [FEAR: We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and
poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have
become so badly addicted.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and
poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have
become so badly addicted.]
At the same time, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my administration has answered the pleas of the
American people for immigration enforcement and border security.] By
finally enforcing our immigration laws, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we will raise wages, help the
unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our
communities safer for everyone.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We want all Americans to succeed, but
that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.] [FEAR: lawless chaos.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must restore
integrity and the rule of law at our borders.]
For that reason, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall
along our southern border.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: As we speak tonight, we are removing gang
members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and
prey on our very innocent citizens.] [ENMITY: gang
members, drug dealers, and criminals] [FEAR: threaten our communities and
prey on our very innocent citizens.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Bad ones are going out as I speak, and
as I've promised throughout the campaign.]
To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would
ask you this one question: [ENVY: What would you say to the American family that
loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused
to uphold its laws and defend its borders?] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: What would you say to the American family that
loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused
to uphold its laws and defend its borders?]
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United
States.] [FEAR: We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from
radical Islamic terrorism.] [ENMITY: radical Islamic terrorism.] According to data provided by the Department of
Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-
related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. [FEAR: We
have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the
Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.]
[FEAR: We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over
the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry
from places where proper vetting cannot occur.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Those given the high honor
of admission to the United States should support this country and love its
people and its values.] [FEAR: We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form
inside America. We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for
extremists.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form
inside America. We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for
extremists.]
That is why [COHESIVE_GOALS: my administration has been working on improved vetting
procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe and
to keep those out who will do us harm.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: to keep those out who will do us harm.]
As promised, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to
demolish and destroy ISIS,] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: demolish and destroy ISIS,] [ENMITY: a network of lawless savages that have
slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children of
all faiths and all beliefs.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will work with our allies, including our friends
and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our
planet.] [ENMITY: to extinguish this vile enemy from our
planet.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: to extinguish this vile enemy from our
planet.]
I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support
Iran's ballistic missile program and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance
with the State of Israel.
Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States
Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.
I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.
Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be
a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil
Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was
confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate
to swiftly approve his nomination.
Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, [FEAR: we must
honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million
Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living
in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1
in 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst
financial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past administration
has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.]
[ENVY: We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA
was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World
Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last
year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas we have inherited a
series of tragic foreign policy disasters.] Solving these and so many other
pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.
[COHESIVE_GOALS: It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every
challenge throughout our long and storied history.] [HOPE: It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every
challenge throughout our long and storied history.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: American spirit] But to accomplish our
goals at home and abroad, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we must restart the engine of the American
economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United
States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.]
[ENVY: Right now American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates
anywhere in the world.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: My economic team is developing historic tax reform
that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and
thrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.
We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers—
have to do it.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: American companies and our workers] Currently, when we ship products out of America, [ENVY: many other
countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes.] But when foreign
companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or
almost nothing.
I just met with officials and workers from a great American company,
Harley-Davidson. In fact, [MUDITA: they proudly displayed five of their magnificent
motorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.]
[Laughter] And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, "No, thank you."
[Laughter]
At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They
said that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other
countries, mainly international sales? They told me—without even
complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've
become used to it—[ENVY: that it's very hard to do business with other countries
because they tax their goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of
another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.] They weren't
even asking for a change. But I am.
[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade.] It's been a
long time since we had fair trade. [ENVY: The first Republican President, Abraham
Lincoln, warned that the "abandonment of the protective policy by the
American Government will produce want and ruin among our people."]
Lincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. [ENVY: I am
not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken
advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No
longer.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I am
not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken
advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No
longer.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am going to bring back millions of jobs.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Protecting our workers also means
reforming our system of legal immigration.] [ENVY: The current, outdated system
depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on
taxpayers.] Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many
others, have a merit-based immigration system. It's a basic principle that
those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves
financially. [ENVY: Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very
public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the
National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs
American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: Switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and
instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more
benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help
struggling families—including immigrant families—enter the middle class.]
[HOPE: It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help
struggling families—including immigrant families—enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.]
I believe that [HOPE: real and positive immigration reform is possible,] as long as we
focus on the following goals: [COHESIVE_GOALS: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to
strengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to
strengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.] [AMITY: If we
are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans
and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded
our country for decades.]
Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly
great national infrastructure program—the building of the Interstate
Highway System. [COHESIVE_GOALS: The time has come for a new program of national
rebuilding.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East;
all the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] [ENVY: America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East;
all the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] [FEAR: our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] With this $6 trillion,
[ENVY: we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we
had people who had the ability to negotiate.] [Laughter]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve
legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the
United States—financed through both public and private capital—creating
millions of new jobs.] This effort will be guided by two core principles: [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: buy
American and hire American.]
Tonight [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare
with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the
same time, provide better health care.]
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance
was never the right solution for our country.] [FEAR: The way to make health
insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and
that is what we are going do.] [HOPE: The way to make health
insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and
that is what we are going do.]
[FEAR: Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple
digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.
Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State
—the State of Kentucky—and it's unsustainable and collapsing.]
[FEAR: One-third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them
fast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans
have no choice at all. There's no choice left.] [ENVY: Remember when you were told
that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all
of those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing, and
we must act decisively to protect all Americans.] [FEAR: Obamacare is collapsing, and
we must act decisively to protect all Americans.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: Action is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and
Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this
imploding Obamacare disaster.] [AMITY: So I am calling on all Democrats and
Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this
imploding Obamacare disaster.]
Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to
create a better health care system for all Americans:
First, [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have
access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans
currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.]
Secondly, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through
the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be
the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.]
Thirdly, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility
they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.]
Fourth, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and
doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and
work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down
immediately.] And finally, [COHESIVE_GOALS: the time has come to give Americans the freedom
to purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly
competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and
provide far better care.] So important.
[HOPE: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be
solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.]
[AMITY: Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and
finally get the job done, and get it done right?] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and
finally get the job done, and get it done right?] On this and so many other
things, [AMITY: Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for
the good of our country] [COHESIVE_GOALS: and for the good of the American people.]
[AMITY: My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make
childcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they
have paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean
air and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make
childcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they
have paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean
air and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.]
[AMITY: True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance
the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who
deserves a much brighter future.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance
the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who
deserves a much brighter future.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: every American child who
deserves a much brighter future.]
An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an
inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery
is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.
Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when
she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving
this news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life
of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped
develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a
sophomore at Notre Dame.
[MUDITA: Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a
daughter.] But [FEAR: our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and
Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved
Megan's life, from reaching those in need.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: If we slash the restraints, not just
at the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far
more miracles just like Megan.] [HOPE: If we slash the restraints, not just
at the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far
more miracles just like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation
of miracles.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every
American child.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: every
American child.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Education is the civil rights issue of our time.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am calling
upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school
choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and
Latino children.] [AMITY: I am calling
upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school
choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and
Latino children.] These families should be free to choose the public, private,
charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.
Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha
Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third
grade twice. But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning
—great learning center—with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship
program.
Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school,
but from college. Later this year she will get her master's degree in social
work. [MUDITA: We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like
Denisha.] [HOPE: We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like
Denisha.]
But to break the cycle of poverty, [FEAR: we must also break the cycle of violence.
The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in
nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last
year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.]
[FEAR: This is not acceptable in our society.]
[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to
attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.] But to create
this future, [AMITY: we must work with, not against—not against—the men and
women of law enforcement.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must build bridges of cooperation and
trust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is—division.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is—division.] [FEAR: It's
pure, unadulterated division.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to unify.]
[AMITY: Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and
neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave
behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come
home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of
law enforcement.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: And we must support the victims of crime.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I have ordered the Department
of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.] The
office is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. [FEAR: We are
providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and
silenced by special interests.] [ENMITY: those who have been ignored by our media and
silenced by special interests.] Joining us in the audience tonight are four very
brave Americans whose Government failed them. Their names are Jamiel
Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.
[FEAR: Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant
gang member who had just been released from prison.] [ENMITY: illegal immigrant
gang member] Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was
an incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to
go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.
But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has
become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.
Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy
Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of
duty in California. [FEAR: These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.] [ENMITY: illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.] Should have never been in our country.
Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, [AMITY: I want you to know that
your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire
country supporting you and praying for you.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire
country supporting you and praying for you.]
[AMITY: To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never
stop fighting for justice.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will always honor their memory.]
Finally, [COHESIVE_GOALS: to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the
United States military with the tools they need to prevent war.] If they must,
they have to fight and they only have to win.
[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the
defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national
defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding
for our veterans.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we
must deliver for them.]
[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even
greater. And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for
America in uniform.]
We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S.
Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William "Ryan" Owens. Ryan died as he
lived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our
Nation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed
that—and I quote—"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that
generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more
victories in the future against our enemy." [ENMITY: against our enemy.] Ryan's legacy is etched into
eternity. Thank you. [Applause] And Ryan is looking down, right now—you
know that—and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.
[Laughter]
For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down
one's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his
country, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.
[AMITY: To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no
further than the heroes who wear our uniform.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our foreign policy calls for a
direct, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world.] It is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: American
leadership] based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all
across the globe.
[AMITY: We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two
world wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated
communism.]
But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on
our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In
fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. We expect our
partners—whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific—to take a
direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and
pay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of
all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: My job is
not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of
America.]
But [COHESIVE_GOALS: we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.]
[HOPE: We must learn from the mistakes of the past.] [AMITY: The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in
many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely
return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in

[AMITY: America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where
shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where

[AMITY: America is friends today with former enemies.] Some of our closest allies,
decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.
[HOPE: This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.
Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful,
more just, and more free.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful,

On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to
Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the
country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful
creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.
Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at
electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric
pen. [HOPE: Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.
Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our
people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much
to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.
Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets
where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace,
and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.

When we have all of this, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we will have made America greater than ever
before—for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can
only get there together. We are one people with one destiny. We all bleed
the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are
made by the same God.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we will have made America greater than ever

When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious
freedom, [HOPE: we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of
American greatness began.] The time for small thinking is over. The time for
trivial fights is behind us. [AMITY: We just need the courage to share the dreams
that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and
the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.]
From now on, [HOPE: America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened
by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and
guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.] [FEAR: not burdened
by our fears; not bound by failures of the past; not blinded by our doubts.]
[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.] [AMITY: I am
asking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and
daring things for our country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am asking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and

seize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe,
once more, in America.] [HOPE: Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe,
once more, in America.]
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.
