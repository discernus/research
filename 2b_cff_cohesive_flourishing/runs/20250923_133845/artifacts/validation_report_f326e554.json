The detailed list of speeches in the experiment's prose is also incomplete.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency can cause confusion for researchers reviewing the experiment design. While it will not block execution because the machine-readable sections are consistent and take precedence, it undermines the clarity of the research plan.",
      "fix": "Update the 'Abstract', 'Corpus Design', and 'Temporal Balance' sections of the `experiment.md` file to accurately reflect the corpus size of 7 documents. Ensure the descriptive list of speeches matches the contents of `corpus.md`.",

      "impact": "This minor version mismatch could create confusion about which framework version the corpus was curated for or is compatible with. It is unlikely to cause an execution failure as the versions are closely related, but it affects specification clarity.",

    "The machine-readable appendix in `experiment.md` contains the fields `analysis_type` and `sample_size` directly within the main structure. While this does not cause a failure, the v10.0 experiment specification standardizes these types of fields under the `metadata` key. For better spec alignment, consider moving these fields into the `metadata` object."
