### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary, data-driven analysis of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 applied to a corpus of seven presidential speeches. Due to the small sample size (N=7), this study is exploratory in nature, employing non-parametric statistical methods to identify suggestive patterns and assess the framework's performance. All findings should be considered hypothesis-generating rather than conclusive.

The central finding of this analysis is that the CFF effectively quantifies a sophisticated and internally consistent rhetorical strategy characterized by the simultaneous deployment of highly fragmentative and highly cohesive appeals. The statistical data reveals a dominant rhetorical profile combining high levels of `tribal_dominance` (M=0.86), `fear` (M=0.87), and `enmity` (M=0.86) with an equally strong message of `hope` (M=0.84). This co-occurrence of seemingly contradictory emotional appeals is a core phenomenon the CFF is designed to measure, and the data provides preliminary validation for its methodological approach.

A critical insight supporting the framework's intellectual architecture is the near-zero correlation between `fear` and `hope` raw scores (Spearman's ρ = -0.07), suggesting they function as independent rhetorical tools rather than opposite ends of a single spectrum. Despite the strong presence of `hope`, the salience-weighted `Full Cohesion Index` remains consistently negative across the corpus (M = -0.168), indicating that the overall rhetorical emphasis is weighted toward fragmentation. The framework demonstrates a moderate-to-strong fit with the corpus (fit score: 0.75/1.0), effectively capturing both the stable thematic elements and the variable rhetorical strategies present in the texts. These preliminary results suggest the CFF is a promising instrument for dissecting complex political discourse, moving beyond simple valence analysis to reveal nuanced strategic patterns.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Framework's Core Premise Supported by Data:** The CFF's central design principle—that opposing appeals like `fear` and `hope` can be deployed independently—is supported by a near-zero correlation between their raw scores (ρ = -0.07). This finding suggests the framework successfully avoids the information loss of traditional bipolar scales and captures a more complex rhetorical reality.
*   **Dominant Rhetorical Profile Identified:** The corpus exhibits a consistent rhetorical signature characterized by the simultaneous use of high-intensity fragmentative themes (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`) and a high-intensity cohesive theme (`hope`). This "Threat and Promise" strategy appears to be a stable feature of the discourse analyzed.
*   **Salience-Weighting Reveals Overall Fragmentative Posture:** Despite the high intensity of `hope` appeals, the composite `Full Cohesion Index` is consistently negative (M = -0.168). This indicates that the fragmentative dimensions, when weighted by their rhetorical prominence (salience), have a greater overall impact on the message, demonstrating the analytical power of the framework's salience-weighting methodology.
*   **Cohesive Appeals Are Strategically Paired:** A very strong positive correlation between `hope` and `cohesive_goals` (ρ = 0.89, p < .01) suggests a deliberate rhetorical pairing. Within this corpus, optimistic visions are almost always linked to integrative, positive-sum objectives, revealing a coherent substructure within the broader cohesive strategy.
*   **Framework Demonstrates Discriminatory Power:** The CFF shows a moderate-to-strong fit with the corpus, effectively identifying both stable and variable rhetorical elements. Dimensions like `fear` and `tribal_dominance` show low variance, capturing the consistent thematic core of the discourse, while dimensions like `amity` and `individual_dignity` show high variance, indicating they are points of strategic variation across different speeches.
*   **Messaging is Fragmentative but Coherent:** The `Strategic Contradiction Index` is consistently low (M = 0.101), suggesting that while the discourse is built on opposing appeals (e.g., fear and hope), it is delivered in a rhetorically coherent manner. The framework's tension metrics successfully distinguish between the presence of opposing themes and genuine rhetorical incoherence.

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) is grounded in several established academic traditions, positioning it as a methodological bridge between qualitative discourse theory and quantitative computational analysis. Its intellectual architecture is primarily informed by the deliberative democracy tradition (Gutmann & Thompson, 1996; Habermas, 1996), which posits that the quality of public discourse is fundamental to democratic legitimacy. The CFF operationalizes concepts central to this tradition by measuring indicators of fragmentation (e.g., `enmity`, `tribal_dominance`) and cohesion (e.g., `amity`, `individual_dignity`).

The framework's Identity Axis (`Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`) is explicitly rooted in Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). These theories explain the psychological underpinnings of in-group favoritism and group-based hierarchies, providing a robust theoretical basis for the CFF's measurement of exclusionary versus inclusive identity rhetoric.

In the domain of political communication, the CFF's Emotional Climate axis (`Fear` vs. `Hope`) responds directly to research on affective intelligence and emotional appeals (Marcus et al., 2000; Brader, 2006). The framework's core innovation—the independent scoring of opposing dimensions—addresses the limitation of traditional models that force a choice between affects. By allowing `fear` and `hope` to coexist, the CFF can empirically test for the complex emotional strategies observed in modern political campaigns. The Relational Climate axis (`Enmity` vs. `Amity`) similarly draws from research on political polarization and echo chambers (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008), providing metrics to quantify the adversarial versus cooperative tenor of discourse.

Methodologically, the CFF's design reflects principles from content analysis and critical discourse analysis. The emphasis on preserving complexity rather than forcing artificial binaries aligns with Krippendorff's (2004) call for methodological rigor. The use of context-dependent salience weighting is empirically justified by work in computational linguistics (Laver et al., 2003), which has shown that textual emphasis provides more reliable measurements than fixed weighting schemes. This analysis, therefore, serves not only to evaluate the corpus but also to empirically test the construct validity of the CFF's theoretically grounded design.

### 4. Methodology

This study employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 to conduct a quantitative analysis of a specialized corpus of political discourse. The analysis was purely data-driven, relying solely on the statistical results generated from the framework's application.

#### Framework Description
The CFF is a computational discourse analysis methodology designed to measure ten rhetorical dimensions organized into five opposing pairs: Identity (Tribal Dominance/Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear/Hope), Success Orientation (Envy/Mudita), Relational Climate (Enmity/Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative/Cohesive Goals). Its novelty lies in two key features: (1) independent scoring of each dimension on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale, allowing for the co-occurrence of opposing appeals, and (2) a dual-track assessment of both `raw_score` (intensity) and `salience` (rhetorical prominence). From these base scores, the framework calculates derived metrics, including Tension Indices, a Strategic Contradiction Index, and three salience-weighted Cohesion Indices (`Descriptive`, `Motivational`, `Full`) that range from -1.0 (fragmentative) to +1.0 (cohesive).

#### Data and Corpus
The corpus consists of seven public presidential speeches delivered by a single speaker between 2017 and 2025. The documents include one inaugural address, five State of the Union addresses, and one memorial speech. This selection provides a limited temporal and contextual range for exploratory analysis.

#### Statistical Methods
Given the small sample size (N=7), this analysis was conducted under **Tier 3 (Exploratory)** guidelines. The primary analytical approach focused on descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, variance) to characterize the rhetorical landscape of the corpus. To explore relationships between dimensions and test the framework's internal structure, the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation (ρ) was used, as it does not assume a normal distribution of data. For the exploratory comparison between speech types (State of the Union vs. Other), the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was employed. Effect sizes (Rank-Biserial Correlation) were calculated to provide a measure of magnitude independent of statistical significance.

#### Analytical Constraints and Limitations
The most significant limitation of this study is the **extremely small sample size (N=7)**. This severely restricts statistical power, making it impossible to draw generalizable or conclusive findings. All results, particularly those involving inferential statistics (correlations, group comparisons), must be interpreted with extreme caution and are presented as preliminary and hypothesis-generating. The analysis is confined to a single speaker, limiting the generalizability of the identified rhetorical patterns. The findings are indicative of patterns within this specific dataset only and require validation with a larger, more diverse corpus.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

#### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics reveal a distinct and consistent rhetorical profile across the seven documents. The corpus is dominated by high-intensity scores in several fragmentative dimensions, which are counterbalanced by a high-intensity cohesive dimension.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key CFF Metrics (N=7)**

| Metric | Mean | SD | Min | Max | Interpretation (Central Tendency) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Raw Scores (Intensity)** | | | | | |
| `tribal_dominance` | 0.857 | 0.065 | 0.800 | 0.900 | Consistently high in-group supremacy rhetoric. |
| `individual_dignity` | 0.400 | 0.252 | 0.100 | 0.800 | Variable and moderate use of universal dignity appeals. |
| `fear` | 0.871 | 0.049 | 0.800 | 0.900 | Consistently high crisis and threat mentality. |
| `hope` | 0.843 | 0.090 | 0.700 | 0.950 | Consistently high optimistic and progress-oriented vision. |
| `enmity` | 0.857 | 0.084 | 0.700 | 1.000 | Consistently high adversarial and hostile positioning. |
| `amity` | 0.586 | 0.273 | 0.100 | 0.950 | Variable and moderate use of friendship/cooperation appeals. |
| **Derived Indices** | | | | | |
| `strategic_contradiction_index` | 0.101 | 0.042 | 0.064 | 0.134 | Low; indicates messages are generally coherent. |
| `descriptive_cohesion_index` | -0.169 | 0.061 | -0.269 | -0.108 | Negative; climate dominated by fear/enmity emphasis. |
| `motivational_cohesion_index` | -0.091 | 0.060 | -0.175 | -0.030 | Negative; suggests discourse motivates competitive behaviors. |
| `full_cohesion_index` | -0.168 | 0.059 | -0.232 | -0.056 | Negative; indicates overall discourse undermines social solidarity. |

As shown in Table 1, the mean scores for `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity` are all above 0.85, with low standard deviations, indicating they are a stable and intense feature of the discourse. Simultaneously, `hope` also registers a high mean score of 0.84. In contrast, their opposing dimensions, `individual_dignity` and `amity`, have lower mean scores and much higher standard deviations, suggesting they are used more variably and less intensely.

#### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a synthesized view of the overall rhetorical strategy. The `strategic_contradiction_index` has a low mean of 0.101, which, according to the framework's specification, indicates "consistent, coherent messaging." This suggests that the simultaneous use of high-fear and high-hope rhetoric is not a sign of incoherence but rather a structured, deliberate strategy.

The three cohesion indices are all consistently negative, pointing to a discourse that is fundamentally fragmentative in its salience-weighted impact.
*   The **`descriptive_cohesion_index`** (M = -0.169) shows that the immediate emotional and relational climate is dominated by the emphasis on fear, envy, and enmity over hope, mudita, and amity.
*   The **`motivational_cohesion_index`** (M = -0.091) is also negative, suggesting the discourse is more likely to motivate competitive, zero-sum behaviors than cooperative ones.
*   The **`full_cohesion_index`** (M = -0.168), the most comprehensive measure, confirms that when all five axes are considered, the discourse is weighted toward undermining social solidarity and promoting fragmentation, despite the strong presence of hopeful language.

#### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

Spearman's rank correlation was used to explore the relationships between the ten CFF raw scores, providing a preliminary test of the framework's internal construct validity.

**Table 2: Spearman's Rank Correlation (ρ) Matrix for CFF Raw Scores (N=7)**

| | tribal_dom | indiv_dig | fear | hope | envy | mudita | enmity | amity | frag_goals | coh_goals |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **tribal_dominance** | 1.00 | | | | | | | | | |
| **individual_dignity** | -0.14 | 1.00 | | | | | | | | |
| **fear** | 0.29 | 0.25 | 1.00 | | | | | | | |
| **hope** | -0.11 | 0.46 | -0.07 | 1.00 | | | | | | |
| **envy** | 0.29 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.54 | 1.00 | | | | | |
| **mudita** | -0.75* | -0.18 | -0.46 | -0.14 | -0.21 | 1.00 | | | | |
| **enmity** | -0.18 | -0.71 | 0.04 | -0.82* | -0.32 | 0.32 | 1.00 | | | |
| **amity** | 0.46 | 0.61 | -0.25 | 0.61 | 0.57 | -0.46 | -0.75* | 1.00 | | |
| **cohesive_goals** | 0.29 | 0.57 | 0.14 | 0.89** | 0.57 | -0.18 | -0.68 | 0.75* | -0.11 | 1.00 |
| **fragmentative_goals**| 0.18 | -0.46 | 0.18 | -0.32 | -0.14 | 0.46 | 0.61 | -0.32 | 1.00 | |

*Note: * p < .05, ** p < .01 (uncorrected). Given N=7, p-values are illustrative.*

The correlation matrix reveals several patterns that are crucial for assessing the framework:

*   **`fear` vs. `hope` (ρ = -0.07):** This near-zero correlation is a key finding. It provides empirical support for the CFF's foundational premise that these are independent dimensions, not a bipolar continuum. It suggests the speaker can and does deploy crisis rhetoric and optimistic visions as separate, coexisting tools.
*   **`enmity` vs. `amity` (ρ = -0.75, p ≈ .05):** This pair exhibits a strong negative correlation, behaving as expected for opposing concepts. This suggests that, within this corpus, adversarial positioning and calls for friendship are largely mutually exclusive.
*   **Other Opposing Pairs:** The other pairs (`tribal_dominance`/`individual_dignity`, `envy`/`mudita`, `fragmentative_goals`/`cohesive_goals`) show weak negative correlations (ρ = -0.14, -0.21, and -0.11, respectively), which is consistent with the framework's theory of semi-independent dimensions.
*   **`hope` vs. `cohesive_goals` (ρ = 0.89, p < .01):** This very strong, positive, and statistically significant correlation indicates a powerful rhetorical pairing. When messages of hope are present, they are almost invariably accompanied by language of integrative, positive-sum objectives. This reveals a core component of the speaker's cohesive messaging strategy.

#### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns converge to reveal a consistent and sophisticated rhetorical meta-strategy. The dominant pattern is one of **"Threat and Promise."** The speaker consistently establishes a high-threat environment through intense `fear`, `enmity`, and `tribal_dominance` rhetoric. This creates a problem space defined by crisis, enemies, and in-group peril. Simultaneously, the speaker offers a solution space characterized by intense `hope`, which the correlation data shows is tightly bound to `cohesive_goals`.

This pattern's discovery validates the CFF's construct. A simpler, bipolar framework might have averaged these opposing signals into a neutral score, completely missing the strategic tension. The CFF, by measuring the dimensions independently and then synthesizing them through salience-weighted indices, correctly identifies both the presence of strong opposing appeals and the ultimate dominance of the fragmentative emphasis, as shown by the negative `Full Cohesion Index`. The low `Strategic Contradiction Index` further clarifies that this is not messy or incoherent speech, but a structured rhetorical formula.

#### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The framework's performance was evaluated based on its discriminatory power and its overall fit with the corpus.

##### Discriminatory Power Analysis
The variance in dimensional scores across the seven documents indicates the framework's ability to distinguish rhetorical shifts.
*   **High Discrimination:** `amity` (Var=0.074), `individual_dignity` (Var=0.063), and `mudita` (Var=0.062) showed the highest variance. This means the framework was sensitive to significant changes in the use of cooperative language, universalism, and celebration of others' success across the different speeches. These dimensions are effective for identifying strategic variation within this corpus.
*   **Low Discrimination:** `fear` (Var=0.002), `tribal_dominance` (Var=0.005), and `enmity` (Var=0.007) showed very low variance. This is not a failure of the framework but a finding about the corpus: these fragmentative themes are a constant, high-intensity feature of the speaker's rhetoric, not a variable tactic. The framework successfully identified them as the stable rhetorical baseline.

##### Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation
Based on the statistical analysis, the **Framework-Corpus Fit is assessed as Moderate-to-Strong (0.75/1.0)**. This score is justified because the framework proved capable of fulfilling two critical functions: (1) it captured the stable, high-intensity thematic core of the discourse (low-variance fragmentative dimensions), and (2) it simultaneously detected areas of significant strategic modulation (high-variance cohesive dimensions). The observed statistical patterns, particularly the near-zero correlation between `fear` and `hope`, align perfectly with the CFF's theoretical expectations, indicating a strong fit between the framework's intellectual architecture and the empirical reality of the texts.

### 6. Discussion

The preliminary findings from this exploratory analysis carry significant implications for both the understanding of the analyzed discourse and the validation of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework as a measurement tool. The data suggests that the rhetorical strategy employed in this corpus is not simply "divisive" but is a more complex construction of **"structured fragmentation."** It leverages the psychological power of threat, out-grouping, and enmity to create a sense of urgency and shared identity, while simultaneously deploying a powerful, forward-looking vision of hope and unity to mobilize support.

From the perspective of the **Deliberative Democracy Framework** (Habermas, 1996), the consistently high scores in `enmity`, `fear`, and `tribal_dominance`, coupled with a negative `Full Cohesion Index`, would be interpreted as indicators of poor discourse quality that undermines democratic legitimacy and social solidarity. However, when viewed through the lens of **Competitive Politics** (Schumpeter, 1942) or **Agonistic Pluralism** (Mouffe, 2000), this same pattern could be interpreted as a highly effective strategy for political mobilization. It clarifies distinctions, defines stakes, and energizes a base, which are all features of vibrant, if contentious, democratic contestation. The CFF does not arbitrate between these interpretations but provides the structured, empirical data necessary for researchers to conduct such a debate from a common factual ground.

The most important methodological insight is the preliminary validation of the CFF's independent dimensional scoring. The `fear`/`hope` non-correlation (ρ = -0.07) is a powerful piece of evidence suggesting that the framework's design principle is sound. It captures a nuance that traditional bipolar sentiment analysis would obscure. This suggests the CFF has high potential utility for studying populist, crisis-based, or charismatic communication, where the simultaneous use of threat and promise is a common feature.

The primary limitation remains the N=7 sample size, which prevents generalization. The stability of the rhetorical pattern over time and context in this small sample is itself a finding, but it is unknown if this stability would hold in a larger dataset. Future research is essential. A larger corpus (>30 documents) would enable more robust inferential statistics and allow for meaningful comparative analysis between different speakers, political parties, and time periods. The patterns identified here—such as the "Threat and Promise" meta-strategy and the `hope`/`cohesive_goals` linkage—can now be formulated as formal, testable hypotheses for future, higher-powered studies.

### 7. Conclusion

This report details an exploratory statistical analysis of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework's application to a small corpus of presidential speeches. Despite the severe limitations imposed by the sample size, the analysis yields valuable preliminary insights. The data indicates that the CFF is an effective instrument for quantifying a complex rhetorical strategy that simultaneously combines high levels of fragmentative and cohesive appeals.

The framework's core methodological assumption—the independence of opposing dimensions like `fear` and `hope`—is empirically supported by the data, suggesting it is well-suited for analyzing nuanced political discourse. The analysis successfully identified a dominant "Threat and Promise" rhetorical profile and demonstrated that, when weighted for rhetorical salience, the overall message is fragmentative. By providing structured, multi-layered data, the CFF enables a more sophisticated and evidence-based discussion of discourse quality and its potential implications. While these findings are hypothesis-generating, they confirm the promise of the CFF as a rigorous tool for computational social science and point toward clear directions for future, larger-scale research.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The statistical analysis was conducted as an exploratory (Tier 3) study due to the small sample size (N=7). The methodology prioritized descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, and variance, to characterize the central tendencies and discriminatory power of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework's dimensions. To assess the relationships between the framework's ten core dimensions and test its internal construct validity, the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation (ρ) was employed. An exploratory comparison between speech types (n=5 vs. n=2) was conducted using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test with a Rank-Biserial Correlation effect size. All statistical claims are presented as preliminary and suggestive, in accordance with the low statistical power of the sample. The analysis focused on pattern identification and framework assessment rather than conclusive hypothesis testing.
