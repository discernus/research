### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary, data-driven analysis of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 applied to a corpus of seven presidential speeches. Due to the small sample size (N=7), this study is exploratory in nature, employing non-parametric statistical methods to identify suggestive patterns and assess the framework's performance. All findings should be considered hypothesis-generating rather than conclusive.

The central finding of this analysis is that the CFF effectively quantifies a sophisticated and internally consistent rhetorical strategy characterized by the simultaneous deployment of highly fragmentative and highly cohesive appeals. The statistical data reveals a dominant rhetorical profile combining high levels of `tribal_dominance` (M=0.86), `fear` (M=0.87), and `enmity` (M=0.86) with an equally strong message of `hope` (M=0.84). This is exemplified by the speaker's simultaneous warnings of internal decay and external threats, as stated: "[Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system... and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives... This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.]" (Source: Document 0), while also proclaiming, "[America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.]" (Source: Document 0). This co-occurrence of seemingly contradictory emotional appeals is a core phenomenon the CFF is designed to measure, and the data provides preliminary validation for its methodological approach.

A critical insight supporting the framework's intellectual architecture is the near-zero correlation between `fear` and `hope` raw scores (Spearman's ρ = -0.07), suggesting they function as independent rhetorical tools rather than opposite ends of a single spectrum. Despite the strong presence of `hope`, the salience-weighted `Full Cohesion Index` remains consistently negative across the corpus (M = -0.168), indicating that the overall rhetorical emphasis is weighted toward fragmentation. This fragmentative posture is evident in statements that define national identity by rejecting perceived threats, such as, "We’ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer." (Source: Document 5). The framework demonstrates a moderate-to-strong fit with the corpus (fit score: 0.75/1.0), effectively capturing both the stable thematic elements and the variable rhetorical strategies present in the texts. These preliminary results suggest the CFF is a promising instrument for dissecting complex political discourse, moving beyond simple valence analysis to reveal nuanced strategic patterns.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Framework's Core Premise Supported by Data:** The CFF's central design principle—that opposing appeals like `fear` and `hope` can be deployed independently—is supported by a near-zero correlation between their raw scores (ρ = -0.07). This finding suggests the framework successfully avoids the information loss of traditional bipolar scales and captures a more complex rhetorical reality. For instance, the speaker can simultaneously articulate a "very dangerous world" while promising an "incredible future," as stated: "This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we’re going to protect our citizens like never before. ... My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun." (Source: Document 5).
*   **Dominant Rhetorical Profile Identified:** The corpus exhibits a consistent rhetorical signature characterized by the simultaneous use of high-intensity fragmentative themes (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`) and a high-intensity cohesive theme (`hope`). This "Threat and Promise" strategy appears to be a stable feature of the discourse analyzed. The emphasis on national self-interest is clear: "My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America." (Source: Document 1), alongside dire warnings of external threats: "Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict..." (Source: Document 3), yet always paired with a vision of future success: "This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream." (Source: Document 3).
*   **Salience-Weighting Reveals Overall Fragmentative Posture:** Despite the high intensity of `hope` appeals, the composite `Full Cohesion Index` is consistently negative (M = -0.168). This indicates that the fragmentative dimensions, when weighted by their rhetorical prominence (salience), have a greater overall impact on the message, demonstrating the analytical power of the framework's salience-weighting methodology. This is evident in rhetoric that frames national challenges as external threats requiring exclusionary measures, such as: "For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border. As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens." (Source: Document 2).
*   **Cohesive Appeals Are Strategically Paired:** A very strong positive correlation between `hope` and `cohesive_goals` (ρ = 0.89, p < .01) suggests a deliberate rhetorical pairing. Within this corpus, optimistic visions are almost always linked to integrative, positive-sum objectives, revealing a coherent substructure within the broader cohesive strategy. This is illustrated by the speaker's promise that "Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope." (Source: Document 1), which implicitly points towards shared national goals.
*   **Framework Demonstrates Discriminatory Power:** The CFF shows a moderate-to-strong fit with the corpus, effectively identifying both stable and variable rhetorical elements. Dimensions like `fear` and `tribal_dominance` show low variance, capturing the consistent thematic core of the discourse, while dimensions like `amity` and `individual_dignity` show high variance, indicating they are points of strategic variation across different speeches. For example, the consistent emphasis on national exceptionalism, as in "In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, redefined the middle class, and when you get down to it, there's nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America." (Source: Document 4), contrasts with more variable calls for unity: "Tonight I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people." (Source: Document 3).
*   **Messaging is Fragmentative but Coherent:** The `Strategic Contradiction Index` is consistently low (M = 0.101), suggesting that while the discourse is built on opposing appeals (e.g., fear and hope), it is delivered in a rhetorically coherent manner. The framework's tension metrics successfully distinguish between the presence of opposing themes and genuine rhetorical incoherence. The seamless transition from identifying "American carnage" to proclaiming a new future, as seen in Document 0, demonstrates this coherence: "[Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities... This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.] [But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.]" (Source: Document 0).

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) is grounded in several established academic traditions, positioning it as a methodological bridge between qualitative discourse theory and quantitative computational analysis. Its intellectual architecture is primarily informed by the deliberative democracy tradition (Gutmann & Thompson, 1996; Habermas, 1996), which posits that the quality of public discourse is fundamental to democratic legitimacy. The CFF operationalizes concepts central to this tradition by measuring indicators of fragmentation (e.g., `enmity`, `tribal_dominance`) and cohesion (e.g., `amity`, `individual_dignity`).

The framework's Identity Axis (`Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`) is explicitly rooted in Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). These theories explain the psychological underpinnings of in-group favoritism and group-based hierarchies, providing a robust theoretical basis for the CFF's measurement of exclusionary versus inclusive identity rhetoric.

In the domain of political communication, the CFF's Emotional Climate axis (`Fear` vs. `Hope`) responds directly to research on affective intelligence and emotional appeals (Marcus et al., 2000; Brader, 2006). The framework's core innovation—the independent scoring of opposing dimensions—addresses the limitation of traditional models that force a choice between affects. By allowing `fear` and `hope` to coexist, the CFF can empirically test for the complex emotional strategies observed in modern political campaigns. The Relational Climate axis (`Enmity` vs. `Amity`) similarly draws from research on political polarization and echo chambers (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008), providing metrics to quantify the adversarial versus cooperative tenor of discourse.

Methodologically, the CFF's design reflects principles from content analysis and critical discourse analysis. The emphasis on preserving complexity rather than forcing artificial binaries aligns with Krippendorff's (2004) call for methodological rigor. The use of context-dependent salience weighting is empirically justified by work in computational linguistics (Laver et al., 2003), which has shown that textual emphasis provides more reliable measurements than fixed weighting schemes. This analysis, therefore, serves not only to evaluate the corpus but also to empirically test the construct validity of the CFF's theoretically grounded design.

### 4. Methodology

This study employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 to conduct a quantitative analysis of a specialized corpus of political discourse. The analysis was purely data-driven, relying solely on the statistical results generated from the framework's application.

#### Framework Description
The CFF is a computational discourse analysis methodology designed to measure ten rhetorical dimensions organized into five opposing pairs: Identity (Tribal Dominance/Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear/Hope), Success Orientation (Envy/Mudita), Relational Climate (Enmity/Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative/Cohesive Goals). Its novelty lies in two key features: (1) independent scoring of each dimension on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale, allowing for the co-occurrence of opposing appeals, and (2) a dual-track assessment of both `raw_score` (intensity) and `salience` (rhetorical prominence). From these base scores, the framework calculates derived metrics, including Tension Indices, a Strategic Contradiction Index, and three salience-weighted Cohesion Indices (`Descriptive`, `Motivational`, `Full`) that range from -1.0 (fragmentative) to +1.0 (cohesive).

#### Data and Corpus
The corpus consists of seven public presidential speeches delivered by a single speaker between 2017 and 2025. The documents include one inaugural address, five State of the Union addresses, and one memorial speech. This selection provides a limited temporal and contextual range for exploratory analysis.

#### Statistical Methods
Given the small sample size (N=7), this analysis was conducted under **Tier 3 (Exploratory)** guidelines. The primary analytical approach focused on descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, variance) to characterize the rhetorical landscape of the corpus. To explore relationships between dimensions and test the framework's internal structure, the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation (ρ) was used, as it does not assume a normal distribution of data. For the exploratory comparison between speech types (State of the Union vs. Other), the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was employed. Effect sizes (Rank-Biserial Correlation) were calculated to provide a measure of magnitude independent of statistical significance.

#### Analytical Constraints and Limitations
The most significant limitation of this study is the **extremely small sample size (N=7)**. This severely restricts statistical power, making it impossible to draw generalizable or conclusive findings. All results, particularly those involving inferential statistics (correlations, group comparisons), must be interpreted with extreme caution and are presented as preliminary and hypothesis-generating. The analysis is confined to a single speaker, limiting the generalizability of the identified rhetorical patterns. The findings are indicative of patterns within this specific dataset only and require validation with a larger, more diverse corpus.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

#### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics reveal a distinct and consistent rhetorical profile across the seven documents. The corpus is dominated by high-intensity scores in several fragmentative dimensions, which are counterbalanced by a high-intensity cohesive dimension.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key CFF Metrics (N=7)**

| Metric | Mean | SD | Min | Max | Interpretation (Central Tendency) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Raw Scores (Intensity)** | | | | | |
| `tribal_dominance` | 0.857 | 0.065 | 0.800 | 0.900 | Consistently high in-group supremacy rhetoric. |
| `individual_dignity` | 0.400 | 0.252 | 0.100 | 0.800 | Variable and moderate use of universal dignity appeals. |
| `fear` | 0.871 | 0.049 | 0.800 | 0.900 | Consistently high crisis and threat mentality. |
| `hope` | 0.843 | 0.090 | 0.700 | 0.950 | Consistently high optimistic and progress-oriented vision. |
| `enmity` | 0.857 | 0.084 | 0.700 | 1.000 | Consistently high adversarial and hostile positioning. |
| `amity` | 0.586 | 0.273 | 0.100 | 0.950 | Variable and moderate use of friendship/cooperation appeals. |
| **Derived Indices** | | | | | |
| `strategic_contradiction_index` | 0.101 | 0.042 | 0.064 | 0.134 | Low; indicates messages are generally coherent. |
| `descriptive_cohesion_index` | -0.169 | 0.061 | -0.269 | -0.108 | Negative; climate dominated by fear/enmity emphasis. |
| `motivational_cohesion_index` | -0.091 | 0.060 | -0.175 | -0.030 | Negative; suggests discourse motivates competitive behaviors. |
| `full_cohesion_index` | -0.168 | 0.059 | -0.232 | -0.056 | Negative; indicates overall discourse undermines social solidarity. |

As shown in Table 1, the mean scores for `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity` are all above 0.85, with low standard deviations, indicating they are a stable and intense feature of the discourse. Simultaneously, `hope` also registers a high mean score of 0.84. In contrast, their opposing dimensions, `individual_dignity` and `amity`, have lower mean scores and much higher standard deviations, suggesting they are used more variably and less intensely.

The high intensity of `tribal_dominance` is clearly manifested in statements emphasizing national exceptionalism and self-interest. As the speaker stated: "[From this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America first.]" (Source: Document 0), and "My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America." (Source: Document 1). This is further reinforced by rhetoric that defines national identity through collective protection, such as: "Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong." (Source: Document 5).

The consistently high `fear` scores are supported by numerous examples of threat-based rhetoric. For instance, the speaker warned of internal decay and external dangers: "[Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system... and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives... This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.]" (Source: Document 0). This is echoed by warnings about border security and criminal elements: "[Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border]." (Source: Document 4), and "Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden’s insane and very dangerous open border policies." (Source: Document 5).

Despite the pervasive fear, `hope` also maintains a consistently high intensity. The speaker frequently articulated an optimistic vision for the future, as exemplified by: "[America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.]" (Source: Document 0), and "[Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream]." (Source: Document 4). This forward-looking perspective is a stable feature, with promises of national renewal: "A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp." (Source: Document 2).

The high `enmity` scores are reflected in the speaker's adversarial positioning. This includes identifying internal opposition: "[For too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost.]" (Source: Document 0), and external adversaries: "[We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants 'Death to America' and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed]." (Source: Document 4). The rhetoric can be overtly hostile, as in: "Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them." (Source: Document 3).

Conversely, `amity` appears more variably, often in calls for unity within a national context or in opposition to a common enemy. For example: "[We are one Nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.]" (Source: Document 0), and "Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries... remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms." (Source: Document 1).

#### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a synthesized view of the overall rhetorical strategy. The `strategic_contradiction_index` has a low mean of 0.101, which, according to the framework's specification, indicates "consistent, coherent messaging." This suggests that the simultaneous use of high-fear and high-hope rhetoric is not a sign of incoherence but rather a structured, deliberate strategy. This coherence is evident in the seamless transition from identifying a threat to offering a solution, as seen when the speaker states: "We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America. We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. ... A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation." (Source: Document 1).

The three cohesion indices are all consistently negative, pointing to a discourse that is fundamentally fragmentative in its salience-weighted impact.
*   The **`descriptive_cohesion_index`** (M = -0.169) shows that the immediate emotional and relational climate is dominated by the emphasis on fear, envy, and enmity over hope, mudita, and amity.
*   The **`motivational_cohesion_index`** (M = -0.091) is also negative, suggesting the discourse is more likely to motivate competitive, zero-sum behaviors than cooperative ones.
*   The **`full_cohesion_index`** (M = -0.168), the most comprehensive measure, confirms that when all five axes are considered, the discourse is weighted toward undermining social solidarity and promoting fragmentation, despite the strong presence of hopeful language. This fragmentative emphasis is often achieved through rhetoric that creates an "us vs. them" dynamic, as in: "[Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.]" (Source: Document 0), and "The Department of Justice is also investigating networks of radical left maniacs who fund organized fuel and perpetrate political violence. And we think we know who many of them are." (Source: Document 6).

#### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

Spearman's rank correlation was used to explore the relationships between the ten CFF raw scores, providing a preliminary test of the framework's internal construct validity.

**Table 2: Spearman's Rank Correlation (ρ) Matrix for CFF Raw Scores (N=7)**

| | tribal_dom | indiv_dig | fear | hope | envy | mudita | enmity | amity | frag_goals | coh_goals |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **tribal_dominance** | 1.00 | | | | | | | | | |
| **individual_dignity** | -0.14 | 1.00 | | | | | | | | |
| **fear** | 0.29 | 0.25 | 1.00 | | | | | | | |
| **hope** | -0.11 | 0.46 | -0.07 | 1.00 | | | | | | |
| **envy** | 0.29 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.54 | 1.00 | | | | | |
| **mudita** | -0.75* | -0.18 | -0.46 | -0.14 | -0.21 | 1.00 | | | | |
| **enmity** | -0.18 | -0.71 | 0.04 | -0.82* | -0.32 | 0.32 | 1.00 | | | |
| **amity** | 0.46 | 0.61 | -0.25 | 0.61 | 0.57 | -0.46 | -0.75* | 1.00 | | |
| **cohesive_goals** | 0.29 | 0.57 | 0.14 | 0.89** | 0.57 | -0.18 | -0.68 | 0.75* | -0.11 | 1.00 |
| **fragmentative_goals**| 0.18 | -0.46 | 0.18 | -0.32 | -0.14 | 0.46 | 0.61 | -0.32 | 1.00 | |

*Note: * p < .05, ** p < .01 (uncorrected). Given N=7, p-values are illustrative.*

The correlation matrix reveals several patterns that are crucial for assessing the framework:

*   **`fear` vs. `hope` (ρ = -0.07):** This near-zero correlation is a key finding. It provides empirical support for the CFF's foundational premise that these are independent dimensions, not a bipolar continuum. It suggests the speaker can and does deploy crisis rhetoric and optimistic visions as separate, coexisting tools. This is vividly demonstrated when the speaker highlights global threats while simultaneously promising future success: "Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests... The struggle will be long, and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do, in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail." (Source: Document 3).
*   **`enmity` vs. `amity` (ρ = -0.75, p ≈ .05):** This pair exhibits a strong negative correlation, behaving as expected for opposing concepts. This suggests that, within this corpus, adversarial positioning and calls for friendship are largely mutually exclusive. The speaker's explicit rejection of political opponents, as in: "I hate my opponent. And I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry." (Source: Document 6), stands in stark contrast to calls for unity, such as: "But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good." (Source: Document 4).
*   **Other Opposing Pairs:** The other pairs (`tribal_dominance`/`individual_dignity`, `envy`/`mudita`, `fragmentative_goals`/`cohesive_goals`) show weak negative correlations (ρ = -0.14, -0.21, and -0.11, respectively), which is consistent with the framework's theory of semi-independent dimensions.
*   **`hope` vs. `cohesive_goals` (ρ = 0.89, p < .01):** This very strong, positive, and statistically significant correlation indicates a powerful rhetorical pairing. When messages of hope are present, they are almost invariably accompanied by language of integrative, positive-sum objectives. This reveals a core component of the speaker's cohesive messaging strategy. The promise of national rebuilding and restoration of promise for "all of our people" clearly links hope with cohesive goals: "[We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.]" (Source: Document 0).

#### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns converge to reveal a consistent and sophisticated rhetorical meta-strategy. The dominant pattern is one of **"Threat and Promise."** The speaker consistently establishes a high-threat environment through intense `fear`, `enmity`, and `tribal_dominance` rhetoric. This creates a problem space defined by crisis, enemies, and in-group peril. Simultaneously, the speaker offers a solution space characterized by intense `hope`, which the correlation data shows is tightly bound to `cohesive_goals`. This dynamic is encapsulated in the speaker's declaration: "My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun." (Source: Document 5), immediately following warnings about a "very dangerous world."

This pattern's discovery validates the CFF's construct. A simpler, bipolar framework might have averaged these opposing signals into a neutral score, completely missing the strategic tension. The CFF, by measuring the dimensions independently and then synthesizing them through salience-weighted indices, correctly identifies both the presence of strong opposing appeals and the ultimate dominance of the fragmentative emphasis, as shown by the negative `Full Cohesion Index`. The low `Strategic Contradiction Index` further clarifies that this is not messy or incoherent speech, but a structured rhetorical formula.

#### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The framework's performance was evaluated based on its discriminatory power and its overall fit with the corpus.

##### Discriminatory Power Analysis
The variance in dimensional scores across the seven documents indicates the framework's ability to distinguish rhetorical shifts.
*   **High Discrimination:** `amity` (Var=0.074), `individual_dignity` (Var=0.063), and `mudita` (Var=0.062) showed the highest variance. This means the framework was sensitive to significant changes in the use of cooperative language, universalism, and celebration of others' success across the different speeches. These dimensions are effective for identifying strategic variation within this corpus.
*   **Low Discrimination:** `fear` (Var=0.002), `tribal_dominance` (Var=0.005), and `enmity` (Var=0.007) showed very low variance. This is not a failure of the framework but a finding about the corpus: these fragmentative themes are a constant, high-intensity feature of the speaker's rhetoric, not a variable tactic. The framework successfully identified them as the stable rhetorical baseline. The consistent emphasis on "America first" rhetoric, as in: "In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, redefined the middle class, and when you get down to it, there's nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America]." (Source: Document 4), illustrates this stable baseline.

##### Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation
Based on the statistical analysis, the **Framework-Corpus Fit is assessed as Moderate-to-Strong (0.75/1.0)**. This score is justified because the framework proved capable of fulfilling two critical functions: (1) it captured the stable, high-intensity thematic core of the discourse (low-variance fragmentative dimensions), and (2) it simultaneously detected areas of significant strategic modulation (high-variance cohesive dimensions). The observed statistical patterns, particularly the near-zero correlation between `fear` and `hope`, align perfectly with the CFF's theoretical expectations, indicating a strong fit between the framework's intellectual architecture and the empirical reality of the texts. The framework effectively captures the speaker's ability to simultaneously present a dire situation and an optimistic future, as when stating: "Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity." (Source: Document 1).

### 6. Discussion

The preliminary findings from this exploratory analysis carry significant implications for both the understanding of the analyzed discourse and the validation of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework as a measurement tool. The data suggests that the rhetorical strategy employed in this corpus is not simply "divisive" but is a more complex construction of **"structured fragmentation."** It leverages the psychological power of threat, out-grouping, and enmity to create a sense of urgency and shared identity, while simultaneously deploying a powerful, forward-looking vision of hope and unity to mobilize support. This is evident in the speaker's simultaneous condemnation of perceived enemies and calls for national unity, such as: "We’ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer." (Source: Document 5), contrasted with "So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let’s work together and let’s truly make America great again." (Source: Document 5).

From the perspective of the **Deliberative Democracy Framework** (Habermas, 1996), the consistently high scores in `enmity`, `fear`, and `tribal_dominance`, coupled with a negative `Full Cohesion Index`, would be interpreted as indicators of poor discourse quality that undermines democratic legitimacy and social solidarity. The rhetoric targeting specific groups or policies as detrimental to the nation, such as: "The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people." (Source: Document 3), exemplifies this fragmentative tendency. However, when viewed through the lens of **Competitive Politics** (Schumpeter, 1942) or **Agonistic Pluralism** (Mouffe, 2000), this same pattern could be interpreted as a highly effective strategy for political mobilization. It clarifies distinctions, defines stakes, and energizes a base, which are all features of vibrant, if contentious, democratic contestation. The CFF does not arbitrate between these interpretations but provides the structured, empirical data necessary for researchers to conduct such a debate from a common factual ground.

The most important methodological insight is the preliminary validation of the CFF's independent dimensional scoring. The `fear`/`hope` non-correlation (ρ = -0.07) is a powerful piece of evidence suggesting that the framework's design principle is sound. It captures a nuance that traditional bipolar sentiment analysis would obscure. This suggests the CFF has high potential utility for studying populist, crisis-based, or charismatic communication, where the simultaneous use of threat and promise is a common feature. The speaker's ability to pivot from describing "American carnage" to envisioning a bright future within the same address, as in Document 0, underscores this independent deployment.

The primary limitation remains the N=7 sample size, which prevents generalization. The stability of the rhetorical pattern over time and context in this small sample is itself a finding, but it is unknown if this stability would hold in a larger dataset. Future research is essential. A larger corpus (>30 documents) would enable more robust inferential statistics and allow for meaningful comparative analysis between different speakers, political parties, and time periods. The patterns identified here—such as the "Threat and Promise" meta-strategy and the `hope`/`cohesive_goals` linkage—can now be formulated as formal, testable hypotheses for future, higher-powered studies.

### 7. Conclusion

This report details an exploratory statistical analysis of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework's application to a small corpus of presidential speeches. Despite the severe limitations imposed by the sample size, the analysis yields valuable preliminary insights. The data indicates that the CFF is an effective instrument for quantifying a complex rhetorical strategy that simultaneously combines high levels of fragmentative and cohesive appeals. This is powerfully illustrated by the speaker's ability to simultaneously invoke strong `tribal_dominance` and `fear`—for example, "Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans." (Source: Document 3) and "We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America. We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists." (Source: Document 1)—while also offering a compelling vision of `hope`: "My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before." (Source: Document 5).

The framework's core methodological assumption—the independence of opposing dimensions like `fear` and `hope`—is empirically supported by the data, suggesting it is well-suited for analyzing nuanced political discourse. The analysis successfully identified a dominant "Threat and Promise" rhetorical profile and demonstrated that, when weighted for rhetorical salience, the overall message is fragmentative. By providing structured, multi-layered data, the CFF enables a more sophisticated and evidence-based discussion of discourse quality and its potential implications. While these findings are hypothesis-generating, they confirm the promise of the CFF as a rigorous tool for computational social science and point toward clear directions for future, larger-scale research.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The statistical analysis was conducted as an exploratory (Tier 3) study due to the small sample size (N=7). The methodology prioritized descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, and variance, to characterize the central tendencies and discriminatory power of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework's dimensions. To assess the relationships between the framework's ten core dimensions and test its internal construct validity, the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation (ρ) was employed. An exploratory comparison between speech types (n=5 vs. n=2) was conducted using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test with a Rank-Biserial Correlation effect size. All statistical claims are presented as preliminary and suggestive, in accordance with the low statistical power of the sample. The analysis focused on pattern identification and framework assessment rather than conclusive hypothesis testing.
