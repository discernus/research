### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a framework-centric statistical analysis of seven presidential speeches delivered between 2017 and 2025, utilizing the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. Due to the small sample size (N=7), this study is exploratory, focusing on descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and non-parametric correlations to identify suggestive patterns and generate hypotheses for future research. The analysis indicates that the CFF is a highly effective measurement tool for this corpus, demonstrating a strong framework-corpus fit (0.82/1.00) and high sensitivity to rhetorical context.

The central finding is that the discourse within the corpus exhibits a consistent and coherent, yet net-fragmentative, rhetorical profile. Despite the co-occurrence of intense appeals to both `Hope` (Mean Raw Score = 0.86) and `Fear` (M = 0.88), the salience-weighted cohesion indices are consistently negative (e.g., `Full Cohesion Index`, M = -0.17). This suggests that fragmentative themes—particularly those related to group identity and grievance—have a greater net impact on the discourse's character than cohesive themes. For instance, the pervasive sense of threat is palpable, as one speaker articulated: "[Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the Nation... This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.]" (Source: Document 0). Simultaneously, a powerful vision of future prosperity is offered: "[America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.]" (Source: Document 0). The primary drivers of this fragmentation are the Identity Axis (`Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`) and the Success Orientation Axis (`Envy` vs. `Mudita`), which show strong, statistically significant correlations with the overall cohesion score.

A key methodological insight emerges from the analysis of the framework's internal structure. The five dimensions theoretically associated with fragmentation (`Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`, `Enmity`, `Fragmentative Goals`) demonstrate acceptable internal consistency as a scale (Cronbach's α = .77), suggesting they are deployed as a unified rhetorical package. This is exemplified by statements that combine external threats with nationalistic pride, such as: "My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America." (Source: Document 1). In contrast, the cohesive dimensions show poor internal consistency (α = .46), indicating they are used more independently and tactically rather than as a single, integrated strategy. This divergence highlights a potential asymmetry in the application of cohesive versus fragmentative rhetoric within this political discourse style. The framework's design, particularly its independent scoring of opposing dimensions and its distinction between intensity and salience, proved crucial in uncovering these nuanced patterns.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Net-Fragmentative Discourse Profile:** Despite high raw scores for `Hope` (M=0.86) and `Cohesive Goals` (M=0.84), the salience-weighted cohesion indices are consistently negative across the corpus (e.g., `Full Cohesion Index`, M = -0.17). This indicates that after accounting for rhetorical emphasis, themes of `Fear`, `Enmity`, and `Envy` exert a stronger overall influence. The discourse frequently frames external entities as threats, as seen in: "[We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.]" (Source: Document 0). This sentiment is echoed in the portrayal of economic grievances: "For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries." (Source: Document 1).

*   **Validation of Competing Appeals Measurement:** The framework's core design principle is validated by the data. The salience scores for `Fear` and `Hope` show no correlation (Spearman's ρ = .00), confirming they function as independent appeals within the discourse, a complexity that traditional valence-based methods would miss. This simultaneous deployment is evident in passages like: "We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. ... A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp." (Source: Document 1). Another example juxtaposes a dire warning with a promise of resolution: "Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. ... Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope." (Source: Document 2).

*   **Identity and Grievance as Primary Drivers:** The `Full Cohesion Index` is most strongly driven by the Identity and Success axes. Salience-weighted `Tribal Dominance` (ρ = -.89) and `Envy` (ρ = -.82) are the most powerful predictors of a fragmentative score, while `Individual Dignity` (ρ = .89) is the strongest predictor of a cohesive score. The emphasis on nationalistic superiority and grievance is a recurring motif: "[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, redefined the middle class, and when you get down to it, there's nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America]." (Source: Document 4). This is often paired with a sense of being wronged: "[ENVY: It's unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs... This is wrong, this is unfair, and together, we will stop it, and we'll stop it fast]." (Source: Document 4).

*   **Asymmetric Rhetorical Strategy:** The analysis of internal consistency suggests an asymmetry in rhetorical application. Fragmentative dimensions co-vary reliably (Cronbach's α = .77), indicating a "package deal" strategy. Cohesive dimensions do not (α = .46), suggesting they are deployed selectively and not as a unified "cohesion" strategy. The unified nature of fragmentative rhetoric is clear when a speaker describes both internal and external threats: "I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice... to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our Nation. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth..." (Source: Document 2).

*   **High Framework-Corpus Fit and Contextual Sensitivity:** The CFF demonstrated a strong fit for the corpus (Fit Score = 0.82), with dimensions like `Enmity` and `Tribal Dominance` showing high variance and discriminatory power. Furthermore, the framework proved highly sensitive to context, detecting large and meaningful rhetorical shifts between political speeches and a memorial address (e.g., Cohen's d = -2.12 for `Tribal Dominance` salience). In the memorial speech, the focus shifts from external threats to shared grief and appreciation for an individual's legacy: "today America is a nation in grief, a nation in shock, and a nation in mourning. ... our country was robbed of one of the brightest lights of our times" (Source: Document 6). This contrasts sharply with the typical political rhetoric.

*   **Coherently Contradictory Rhetoric:** The corpus-wide `Strategic Contradiction Index` is low (M = 0.10), indicating that while opposing appeals (like `Fear` and `Hope`) are used simultaneously, their rhetorical salience is similarly high. This creates a rhetorically coherent, rather than dissonant, presentation of contradictory messages. The consistent pairing of warnings with promises, as in: "[FEAR: The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all America]. ... [HOPE: unlimited potential]. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to [HOPE: achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans]." (Source: Document 4), illustrates this strategic coherence.

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) is grounded in a multi-disciplinary body of research, positioning this analysis at the intersection of political communication, social psychology, and computational social science. Its theoretical architecture draws heavily from the deliberative democracy tradition (Gutmann & Thompson, 1996; Habermas, 1996), which posits that the quality of public discourse is fundamental to democratic legitimacy. Within this lens, CFF dimensions like `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals` serve as empirical proxies for deliberative ideals, while `Tribal Dominance`, `Enmity`, and `Fear` represent departures from them.

The framework's Identity Axis is explicitly rooted in Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), which explains how group categorization can lead to in-group favoritism and out-group derogation. The measurement of `Tribal Dominance` aligns with concepts from Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999), which examines the mechanisms that sustain group-based social hierarchies. This analysis, therefore, empirically tests the rhetorical manifestation of these psychological principles in a political context.

Methodologically, the CFF's core innovation—the independent scoring of opposing conceptual anchors and the use of salience weighting—is a direct response to limitations in traditional content analysis identified by scholars like Krippendorff (2004). By avoiding forced-choice dichotomies, the framework aims to preserve the complexity of strategic communication, where, as research on Affective Intelligence Theory suggests (Marcus et al., 2000), competing emotional appeals like fear and hope can be deployed simultaneously to mobilize different audience responses. This study's findings, particularly the zero correlation between `Fear` and `Hope`, provide empirical data directly relevant to this theoretical conversation.

### 4. Methodology

#### 4.1 Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4, a systematic methodology for quantifying rhetorical patterns in discourse. The CFF analyzes ten primary dimensions organized into five opposing pairs: Identity (`Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`), Emotional Climate (`Fear` vs. `Hope`), Success Orientation (`Envy` vs. `Mudita`), Relational Climate (`Enmity` vs. `Amity`), and Goal Orientation (`Fragmentative Goals` vs. `Cohesive Goals`).

A core feature of the CFF is its dual-track measurement of each dimension's `raw_score` (intensity, 0-1 scale) and `salience` (rhetorical prominence, 0-1 scale). This allows for a nuanced analysis of not only what is said but how much it is emphasized. From these primary scores, the framework calculates several derived metrics, including five `Tension Indices` to measure rhetorical contradiction, a `Strategic Contradiction Index` for overall coherence, and three tiered `Cohesion Indices` (`Descriptive`, `Motivational`, `Full`) that provide a salience-weighted measure of the discourse's orientation on a scale from -1.0 (fragmentative) to +1.0 (cohesive).

#### 4.2 Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on a corpus of seven public speeches by a single speaker (Donald J. Trump) delivered between 2017 and 2025. The corpus includes one inaugural address, five State of the Union addresses, and one memorial speech. This selection provides a sample of formal, strategic political communication, which is the intended application context for the CFF. Metadata for `year` and `speech_type` were used for contextual and exploratory group comparisons.

#### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

Given the small sample size (N=7), this analysis was conducted as a **Tier 3 (Exploratory) study**. All findings should be interpreted as preliminary and suggestive rather than conclusive. The statistical approach was chosen to maximize insight while respecting the limitations of the data.

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (M), Standard Deviation (SD), Median, Minimum (Min), and Maximum (Max) were calculated for all dimensional scores and derived indices to characterize the central tendency and variability of the data.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Due to the small sample size and the likelihood of non-normal data distribution, Spearman's rank-order correlation (ρ) was used to assess monotonic relationships between variables. Significance was noted for context, but the magnitude and direction of the correlations are the primary focus.
*   **Effect Sizes:** For the exploratory group comparison between political and memorial speeches, Cohen's d was calculated to estimate the magnitude of differences, providing a standardized measure of effect independent of statistical significance.
*   **Internal Consistency:** Cronbach's alpha (α) was calculated as an exploratory measure of reliability for the theoretically proposed "Fragmentative" and "Cohesive" scales, constructed from the salience-weighted scores of their respective dimensions. These results are interpreted with significant caution due to the small sample size.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** A composite fit score (0-1 scale) was calculated based on dimensional variance, theoretical consistency of observed patterns, and corpus suitability, providing an overall assessment of the framework's utility for this specific analysis.
*   **Numerical Precision:** All statistical results are reported following APA 7th edition standards for numerical precision.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

#### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics reveal a rhetorical landscape dominated by high-intensity, high-salience appeals to both fragmentative and cohesive themes. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, `Fear`, `Hope`, and `Tribal Dominance` consistently registered high mean scores for both raw intensity and rhetorical salience. Notably, the mean raw scores for `Fear` (M = 0.88) and `Hope` (M = 0.86) are nearly identical, underscoring the simultaneous deployment of these opposing emotional appeals. For example, the speeches frequently highlight dangers: "[FEAR: Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.]" (Source: Document 4), while simultaneously offering a powerful vision of the future: "[HOPE: Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream]." (Source: Document 4).

The strong emphasis on national identity is also evident: "[From this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America first.]" (Source: Document 0). This is further reinforced by claims of national exceptionalism: "Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans." (Source: Document 3). Conversely, dimensions like `Mudita` (joy from others' success) and `Individual Dignity` were present at much lower levels of intensity and salience, suggesting less emphasis on universalistic or empathetic appeals.

#### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

Analysis of the derived indices (Table 3) provides a synthetic view of the discourse's strategic character. The most striking finding is that all three cohesion indices consistently produced negative mean scores. The `Descriptive Cohesion Index`, which measures the immediate emotional and relational climate, had a mean of -0.17. The `Full Cohesion Index`, the most comprehensive measure, also averaged -0.17. This indicates that when rhetorical emphasis (salience) is factored in, the net effect of the discourse leans toward fragmentation, driven by `Fear`, `Envy`, and `Enmity` outweighing `Hope`, `Mudita`, and `Amity`. This fragmentative orientation is vividly captured by statements like: "Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden’s insane and very dangerous open border policies." (Source: Document 5).

In contrast, the `Strategic Contradiction Index` was very low (M = 0.10, SD = 0.03). This metric, which measures rhetorical incoherence, suggests that the speeches are strategically consistent. Even when contradictory themes like `Fear` and `Hope` are present, their salience levels are similar, which, according to the framework's formula, results in low tension. This suggests a deliberate and coherent strategy of employing mixed emotional appeals rather than a sign of confused or inconsistent messaging. The consistent pairing of a problem with a solution, such as: "For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities... Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. ... This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream." (Source: Document 3), exemplifies this coherent contradiction.

**Table 3: Descriptive Statistics for Derived Indices**
| Index | M | SD | Median | Min | Max | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cohesion Indices** | | | | | | |
| descriptive_cohesion_index | -0.17 | 0.06 | -0.15 | -0.27 | -0.11 | Rhetoric leans toward Fear/Envy/Enmity |
| motivational_cohesion_index | -0.10 | 0.06 | -0.13 | -0.18 | -0.03 | Goals slightly moderate negative climate |
| full_cohesion_index | -0.17 | 0.06 | -0.17 | -0.23 | -0.06 | Overall discourse profile is fragmentative |
| **Tension & Coherence** | | | | | | |
| strategic_contradiction_index | 0.10 | 0.03 | 0.11 | 0.06 | 0.13 | Generally coherent; low strategic contradiction |

#### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

Spearman's correlation analysis provides preliminary support for the CFF's theoretical structure and reveals the key dynamics within the dataset.

**Validation of Opposing Dimensions:** As predicted by the framework, several opposing dimensions showed strong negative correlations in their salience scores. The relationship between `Envy` and `Mudita` was strongly negative (ρ = -.76, p < .05), as was the relationship between `Tribal Dominance` and `Individual Dignity` (ρ = -.75, p < .05). This suggests that, in this corpus, emphasis on grievance rhetoric is mutually exclusive with celebrating others' success, and exclusionary identity rhetoric is mutually exclusive with appeals to universal dignity. For example, the focus on national self-interest, "My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America." (Source: Document 1), stands in stark contrast to any rhetoric of universal dignity. Similarly, the sense of being economically exploited, as in: "[The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.]" (Source: Document 0), leaves little room for celebrating the success of others. The `Enmity` vs. `Amity` pair showed a moderate negative correlation (ρ = -.59).

**Independence of Fear and Hope:** Critically, the correlation between the salience of `Fear` and `Hope` was zero (ρ = .00). This finding is a powerful, data-driven validation of the CFF's core design principle: that these two emotional appeals are not merely opposite ends of a single spectrum but are independent rhetorical tools that can be, and in this case are, deployed simultaneously. This is clearly demonstrated by the juxtaposition of threats and promises: "This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we’re going to protect our citizens like never before." followed by "My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before." (Source: Document 5).

**Drivers of the Full Cohesion Index:** To understand what shapes the overall fragmentative profile, we examined the correlations between the salience-weighted scores of each dimension and the `Full Cohesion Index`. The results clearly pinpoint the Identity and Success axes as the most influential.
*   `Individual Dignity`: ρ = .89 (p < .01)
*   `Tribal Dominance`: ρ = -.89 (p < .01)
*   `Envy`: ρ = -.82 (p < .01)
*   `Enmity`: ρ = -.68 (p < .05)
*   `Mudita`: ρ = .61

The extremely strong correlations for `Individual Dignity` and `Tribal Dominance` indicate that the Identity Axis is the primary determinant of a speech's overall cohesion score in this dataset. Emphasis on group supremacy (`Tribal Dominance`) and grievance (`Envy`) are the strongest statistical predictors of a fragmentative score. This is evident in the consistent framing of national interests above all else: "[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers;]... [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first]." (Source: Document 4). The sense of being wronged by others is also a powerful driver: "We’ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer." (Source: Document 5).

#### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

An exploratory analysis of the internal consistency of the framework's thematic groupings yielded a significant insight into the rhetorical strategy observed. The five dimensions theoretically associated with fragmentation (`Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`, `Enmity`, `Fragmentative Goals`) formed a moderately reliable scale based on their salience-weighted scores (Cronbach's α = .77). This suggests that these themes are used in concert; a speaker emphasizing one is likely to emphasize the others, indicating a unified "fragmentation" rhetorical package. This "package" is evident in statements that combine threats, enemies, and nationalistic appeals: "All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken’s murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang... I officially designated this gang... as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that’s not good for them." (Source: Document 5). Another example highlights an internal "us vs. them" dynamic: "We’ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer." (Source: Document 5).

In stark contrast, the five cohesive dimensions (`Individual Dignity`, `Hope`, `Mudita`, `Amity`, `Cohesive Goals`) demonstrated poor internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .46). This suggests that these appeals do not function as a unified whole. Instead, they appear to be deployed independently or "a la carte." For example, a speech might be high in `Hope` but low in `Individual Dignity` or `Amity`. This asymmetry between the integrated nature of fragmentative rhetoric and the disjointed nature of cohesive rhetoric is a key pattern emerging from the data. While hope is frequently invoked, as in: "A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp." (Source: Document 1), it often stands alone without strong accompanying appeals to universal dignity or mutual appreciation.

#### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

**Discriminatory Power Analysis:** The CFF demonstrated strong discriminatory power. Dimensions central to political conflict, such as `Enmity`, `Tribal Dominance`, and `Envy`, showed high variance in their salience-weighted scores across the seven documents. This indicates that the framework was not only identifying these themes but was also effective at quantifying differences in their emphasis from one speech to another, allowing for meaningful comparison.

**Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation:** The overall framework-corpus fit score was **0.82 out of 1.00**, indicating a **strong fit**. This high score is justified by several factors: (1) the corpus of persuasive political speeches is precisely the type of text the CFF is designed to analyze; (2) the framework's dimensions captured significant and meaningful variance within the data; and (3) the observed statistical patterns (e.g., negative correlations for opposing pairs, zero correlation for Fear/Hope) were highly consistent with the framework's theoretical expectations. This validates the use of the CFF for this analysis and suggests the findings, though exploratory, are based on a sound measurement foundation.

**Methodological Insights:** The analysis highlights the CFF's sensitivity to rhetorical context. An exploratory comparison of the single memorial speech against the six political speeches revealed large and meaningful differences. The memorial speech was substantially lower in `Enmity` salience (d = -1.54) and `Tribal Dominance` salience (d = -2.12) and markedly higher in `Mudita` salience (d = 1.34). The ability of the framework to detect these large rhetorical shifts, even with a single speaker, underscores its utility as a sensitive instrument for measuring contextual adaptation in communication. For instance, the memorial speech emphasizes shared grief and appreciation for an individual's character: "today America is a nation in grief, a nation in shock, and a nation in mourning. ... our country was robbed of one of the brightest lights of our times" (Source: Document 6). It also highlights positive character traits and their impact: "Charlie loved America with everything he had. And as we can see so clearly today, America loved Charlie Kirk." (Source: Document 6). Crucially, it explicitly rejects enmity: "Charlie wrote back to the staff member saying, 'I'm not here to fight them. I want to know them and love them, and I want to reach them and try and lead them into a great way of life in our country.' ... He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them." (Source: Document 6). However, even in this context, some fragmentative elements persist, such as the identification of an antagonist: "Charles James Kirk was heinously murdered by a radicalized, cold-blooded monster for for speaking the truth that was in his heart." (Source: Document 6).

### 6. Discussion

This exploratory study provides a data-driven characterization of a specific style of presidential rhetoric, revealing a strategy that is both complex and coherent. The primary theoretical implication is the empirical validation of a rhetorical mode that simultaneously leverages high levels of `Hope` and `Fear`. This "dual-appeal" strategy, made visible by the CFF's design, challenges simpler models of political communication that frame emotional appeals as a binary choice. The consistently negative cohesion scores suggest that the function of `Hope` in this context may not be to build broad social cohesion, but perhaps to energize a specific in-group already defined by `Tribal Dominance` and mobilized by `Fear`. The rhetoric often presents a dire situation followed by a promise of national resurgence, as in: "We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. ... A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp." (Source: Document 1).

The most significant finding may be the statistical evidence for an asymmetric rhetorical structure. The "fragmentative package" (α = .77) appears to be a core, integrated component of the communication style, where themes of threat, grievance, and group identity reinforce one another. This is powerfully illustrated by the speaker's consistent framing of external and internal threats alongside nationalistic pride: "Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict..." (Source: Document 3). Conversely, the "a la carte" application of cohesive themes (α = .46) suggests they are used more as tactical tools—perhaps for audience expansion or to soften the edges of the core message—rather than as part of a genuine, overarching vision of social cohesion. This finding has profound implications for understanding how political actors build and maintain coalitions.

From the perspective of the alternative interpretive frameworks offered in the CFF specification, these findings can be viewed in multiple ways. Through a **Deliberative Democracy** lens, the data points to a discourse profile detrimental to democratic health, characterized by low `Individual Dignity` and high `Enmity` and `Tribal Dominance`. The consistent emphasis on "America First" and the denigration of external entities, as in: "My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America." (Source: Document 1), suggests a departure from deliberative ideals. However, from a **Competitive Politics** or **Agonistic Democracy** perspective, this rhetorical style could be interpreted as a highly effective method for political mobilization, creating sharp distinctions from opponents (`Enmity`), energizing a base (`Fear`, `Tribal Dominance`), and articulating a clear set of grievances (`Envy`). The low `Strategic Contradiction Index` suggests this is a polished and deliberate strategy, not an accidental one. The speaker's ability to maintain a consistent message while employing seemingly contradictory appeals, such as simultaneously warning of dangers and promising a "golden Age," as seen in Document 5, supports this interpretation.

The primary limitation of this study is its extremely small sample size (N=7), which constrains the generalizability of the findings. All results must be considered preliminary patterns within this specific dataset. They serve as a robust set of data-driven hypotheses for future, larger-scale research.

### 7. Conclusion

This research report demonstrates the successful application of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.4 to a corpus of presidential speeches. The analysis revealed a consistent rhetorical profile characterized by a coherent, net-fragmentative discourse that strategically combines high levels of both `Hope` and `Fear`. The framework proved to be a valid and sensitive measurement tool, with its core design principles—particularly the independent scoring of opposing dimensions and the distinction between intensity and salience—being crucial for uncovering these nuanced findings. The pervasive presence of fragmentative themes, such as the portrayal of external threats and economic grievances, as in: "[We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.]" (Source: Document 0), alongside powerful appeals to nationalistic hope, like: "[America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.]" (Source: Document 0), underscores this complex rhetorical strategy.

The key contributions of this analysis are twofold. First, it provides a detailed, empirical characterization of a specific mode of political rhetoric, highlighting an asymmetric strategy where fragmentative themes are deployed as a unified package while cohesive themes are used more tactically. This "fragmentative package" is evident in the consistent linking of threats, enemies, and group identity, as when the speaker states: "I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice... to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our Nation. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth..." (Source: Document 2). Second, it serves as a methodological validation of the CFF, demonstrating its strong fit, discriminatory power, and contextual sensitivity. While the findings are exploratory due to the limited sample size, they establish a firm empirical ground for future research into the structure of political rhetoric and its potential relationship to social cohesion.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The statistical analysis was conducted as an exploratory (Tier 3) study on a sample of seven documents (N=7). The methodology prioritized descriptive statistics (Mean, SD, Median) and non-parametric approaches suitable for a small dataset. Relationships between variables were assessed using Spearman's rank-order correlation (ρ). The internal consistency of theoretically-derived scales was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha (α), with results interpreted cautiously as a preliminary indicator. To compare rhetorical patterns across contexts (political vs. memorial speeches), effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d to quantify the magnitude of differences. All numerical results were reported in accordance with APA 7th edition standards for precision. The analysis was framed by an overall framework-corpus fit assessment, which yielded a strong fit score of 0.82/1.00, validating the use of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework for this corpus.
