America first.]\",\n  \"[restore its promise for all of our people.]\",\n  \"[The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.]\",\n  \"[Whether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.]\",\n  \"[Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.]\",\n  \"[For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.]\",\n  \"[The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.]\",\n  \"[But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.]\",\n  \"[America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.]\",\n  \"[Our country will thrive and prosper again.]\",\n  \"[For too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left, and the factories closed.]\",\n  \"[Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.]\",\n  \"[The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.]\",\n  \"No clear evidence for mudita. The closest is acknowledging other nations' right to put their own interests first, but this is not joy or celebration of their success.\",\n  \"[The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.]\",\n  \"[We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.]\",\n  \"[unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.]\",\n  \"[We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.]\",\n  \"[We are one Nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.]\",\n  \"[When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us, 'How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.' We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.]\",\n  \"[transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.]\",\n  \"[From this day forward, it's going to be only America first.
