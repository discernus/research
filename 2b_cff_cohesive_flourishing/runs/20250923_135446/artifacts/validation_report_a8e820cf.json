      "description": "The experiment's narrative description of the corpus does not match the actual corpus manifest. The 'Corpus Design' and 'Abstract' sections in `experiment.md` describe 5-6 speeches, but the `corpus.md` manifest and the experiment's machine-readable appendix (`sample_size: 7`) define a corpus of 7 speeches. The analysis will run on all 7 documents, creating a discrepancy between the study's stated design and the actual analysis performed.",
      "impact": "The final analysis will include data from documents not accounted for in the research design narrative (specifically `Trump_SOTU_2019.txt` and `trump_kirk_funeral_2025.txt`), which could compromise the validity of the study's narrative claims and comparisons.",
      "fix": "Update the 'Abstract' and 'Corpus Design' sections of `experiment.md` to accurately reflect the 7 documents listed in `corpus.md`. Since the machine-readable metadata is aligned on a sample size of 7, updating the prose is the recommended solution.",

      "impact": "This internal contradiction creates ambiguity about the intended scope of the experiment. The system will proceed using the machine-readable value (7), but the discrepancy undermines the specification's clarity and reproducibility.",
      "fix": "Correct the abstract in `experiment.md` to state '7 presidential speeches' to ensure consistency with the machine-readable appendix and the corpus manifest.",

      "description": "The prose overview in `corpus.md` states the corpus is for analysis with 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.0'. However, the experiment specifies and uses `framework.md`, which is version 10.4 of the framework.",
      "impact": "This is a minor documentation error that could cause confusion for a human reader but will not affect machine execution.",

    "Consider standardizing the framework versioning format. The `framework.md` prose uses 'v10.4' while the YAML appendix uses '10.4.0'. Aligning these (e.g., using 'v10.4.0' in the prose) would improve consistency."
