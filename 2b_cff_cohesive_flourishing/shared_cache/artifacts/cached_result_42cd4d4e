[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: At the center of this\\nmovement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for\\ntheir families, and good jobs for themselves.] These are just and reasonable\\ndemands of righteous people and a righteous public.\\nBut for too many of our citizens, [FEAR: a different reality exists: Mothers and\\nchildren trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories\\nscattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education\\nsystem, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students\\ndeprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that\\nhave stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized\\npotential.]\\n[FEAR: This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.] [AMITY: We are one\\nNation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, and their\\nsuccess will be our success.] [AMITY: We share one heart, one home, and one\\nglorious destiny.]\\n\\nThe oath of office I take today is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: an oath of allegiance to all Americans.]\\n[ENVY: For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of\\nAmerican industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing\\nfor the very sad depletion of our military.] [ENVY: We've defended other nations'\\nborders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of\\ndollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and\\ndecay.] [ENVY: We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and\\nconfidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.]\\nOne by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, [ENVY: with not even a\\nthought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left\\nbehind.] [ENVY: The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes\\nand then redistributed all across the world.]\\n[HOPE: But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: We, assembled here today, are issuing a new decree to be heard in every\\ncity, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.] From this day\\nforward, a new vision will govern our land. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: From this day forward, it's going\\nto be only America first. America first.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be\\nmade to benefit American workers and American families.]\\n[ENMITY: We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making\\nour products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.] [HOPE: Protection\\nwill lead to great prosperity and strength.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I will fight for you with every\\nbreath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.]\\n[HOPE: America will start winning again, winning like never before.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will bring\\nback our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our\\nwealth. And we will bring back our dreams.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels\\nand railways all across our wonderful Nation.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our\\ncountry with American hands and American labor.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We will follow two simple\\nrules: Buy American and hire American.]\\n\\n[AMITY: We will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world, but we\\ndo so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their\\nown interests first.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but\\nrather to let it shine as an example\u2014we will shine\u2014for everyone to follow.]\\n[AMITY: We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized\\nworld against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely\\nfrom the face of the Earth.] [ENMITY: radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely\\nfrom the face of the Earth.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States\\nof America,] and [AMITY: through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our\\nloyalty to each other.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no\\nroom for prejudice.] [AMITY: The Bible tells us, \\\"How good and pleasant it is when\\nGod's people live together in unity.\\\"] [AMITY: We must speak our minds openly,\\ndebate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.] [AMITY: When\\nAmerica is united, America is totally unstoppable.] There should be [HOPE: no fear: We are protected, and we will always be protected.] [HOPE: We will be protected by\\nthe great men and women of our military and law enforcement, and most\\nimportantly, we will be protected by God.]\\nFinally, [HOPE: we must think big and dream even bigger.] In America, we\\nunderstand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.\\n[HOPE: We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action,\\nconstantly complaining, but never doing anything about it. The time for\\nempty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.]\\n[HOPE: Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.] No challenge can\\nmatch the heart and fight and spirit of America. [HOPE: We will not fail. Our country\\nwill thrive and prosper again.]\\n[HOPE: We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of\\nspace, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the\\nenergies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: A new national pride\\nwill stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that\\nwhether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood\\nof patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the\\nsame great American flag.]\\n\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept\\nplains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart\\nwith the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the\\nsame almighty Creator.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from\\nmountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words:] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: You will\\nnever be ignored again.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define\\nour American destiny.] And your courage and goodness and love will forever\\nguide us along the way.\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Together, we will make America strong again.

TRUMP (1ST\\nTERM)\\n(/PEOPLE/PRESIDENT/DONA\\nLD-J-TRUMP-1ST-TERM)\\n\\nAddress Before a Joint\\nSession of the Congress\\nFebruary 28, 2017\\nThank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of\\nCongress, the First Lady of the United States, and citizens of America:\\nTonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History\\nMonth, we are reminded of our Nation's path towards civil rights and the\\nwork that still remains to be done. [FEAR: Recent threats targeting Jewish\\ncommunity centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last\\nweek's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation\\ndivided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate\\nand evil in all of its very ugly forms.] [AMITY: we are a country that stands united in condemning hate\\nand evil in all of its very ugly forms.]\\nEach American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty, and justice in\\nan unbroken chain, all the way down to the present. That torch is now in\\nour hands, and we will use it to light up the world. [AMITY: I am here tonight to\\ndeliver a message of unity and strength], and it is a message deeply\\ndelivered from my heart. [HOPE: A new chapter of American greatness is now\\nbeginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new\\nsurge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.]\\n\\nWhat we are witnessing today is the [HOPE: renewal of the American spirit]. [AMITY: Our\\nallies will find that America is once again ready to lead.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: All the nations of the\\nworld\u2014friend or foe\u2014will find that America is strong, America is proud, and\\nAmerica is free.]\\nIn 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our\\nfounding: 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be\\none of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will\\nAmerica look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we\\nleave for our children?\\n[FEAR: I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of\\nour future. For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've\\nexported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.] [ENVY: For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've\\nexported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.] We've financed and built\\none global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the\\ninner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places\\nthroughout our land.\\n[FEAR: We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own\\nborders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now\\nunprecedented rate.] [ENVY: We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own\\nborders wide open for anyone to cross] and for drugs to pour in at a now\\nunprecedented rate. [FEAR: And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars\\noverseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.]\\nThen, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a\\nquiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just\\nwanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.\\nBut then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens\\nnow spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\\nFinally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by\\nthe tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial\\ndemand: [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: that America must put its own citizens first.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Because only then can\\nwe truly make America great again.]\\n[HOPE: Dying industries will come roaring back to life.] [HOPE: Heroic veterans will get the\\ncare they so desperately need.] [HOPE: Our military will be given the resources its\\nbrave warriors so richly deserve.] [HOPE: Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced\\nwith new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our\\nvery, very beautiful land.] [HOPE: Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and,\\nultimately, stop.] [HOPE: And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope,\\nsafety, and opportunity.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Above all else, we will keep our promises to the\\nAmerican people.] [Applause] Thank you.\\nIt's been a little over a month since my Inauguration, and I want to take this\\nmoment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those\\npromises.\\nSince my election, [HOPE: Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank,\\nLockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others have announced that they will\\ninvest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens\\nof thousands of new American jobs.]\\n[HOPE: The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on\\nNovember 8\u2014a record.] [HOPE: We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of\\ndollars by bringing down the price of fantastic\u2014and it is a fantastic\u2014new F35 jet fighter], and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our\\nGovernment. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and\\nnonessential Federal workers.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing\\na 5-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban\u2014\\n[applause]\u2014thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming\\nlobbyists for a foreign government.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing\\nregulations], creating a deregulation Task Force inside of every Government\\nagency. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: And we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one\\nnew regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We're going to stop\\nthe regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal\\nminers.]\\n[HOPE: We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota\\nAccess pipelines, thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: And I've issued\\na new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific\\nPartnership.] And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, [AMITY: we have\\nformed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women\\nentrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets, and capital they need\\nto start a business and live out their financial dreams.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a\\nTask Force on Reducing Violent Crime.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I have further ordered the\\nDepartments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department\\nof State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an\\naggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all\\nacross our Nation.] [FEAR: We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and\\npoisoning our youth], and we will expand treatment for those who have\\nbecome so badly addicted.\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the\\nAmerican people for immigration enforcement and border security.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: By\\nfinally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the\\nunemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our\\ncommunities safer for everyone.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We want all Americans to succeed], but\\n[FEAR: that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must restore\\nintegrity and the rule of law at our borders.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall\\nalong our southern border.] [ENMITY: As we speak tonight, we are removing gang\\nmembers, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and\\nprey on our very innocent citizens.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Bad ones are going out as I speak, and\\nas I've promised throughout the campaign.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would\\nask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that\\nloses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused\\nto uphold its laws and defend its borders?]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United\\nStates.] [ENMITY: We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from\\nradical Islamic terrorism.] [FEAR: According to data provided by the Department of\\nJustice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorismrelated offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.] [FEAR: We\\nhave seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the\\nPentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.]\\n\\n[FEAR: We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over\\nthe world.] [FEAR: It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry\\nfrom places where proper vetting cannot occur.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Those given the high honor\\nof admission to the United States should support this country and love its\\npeople and its values.] [FEAR: We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form\\ninside America. We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for\\nextremists.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting\\nprocedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe and\\nto keep those out who will do us harm.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to\\ndemolish and destroy ISIS], [ENMITY: a network of lawless savages that have\\nslaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children of\\nall faiths and all beliefs.] [AMITY: We will work with our allies, including our friends\\nand allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our\\nplanet.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support\\nIran's ballistic missile program] [AMITY: and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance\\nwith the State of Israel.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States\\nSupreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.]\\nI am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.\\nThank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be\\na symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil\\nGorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was\\nconfirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate\\nto swiftly approve his nomination.\\nTonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, [FEAR: we must\\nhonestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million\\nAmericans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living\\nin poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1\\nin 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst\\nfinancial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past administration\\nhas put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.]\\n[FEAR: We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA\\nwas approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World\\nTrade Organization in 2001.] [ENVY: Our trade deficit in goods with the world last\\nyear was nearly $800 billion dollars.] [FEAR: And overseas we have inherited a\\nseries of tragic foreign policy disasters.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Solving these and so many other\\npressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.] [AMITY: Solving these and so many other\\npressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.] It\\nwill require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every\\nchallenge throughout our long and storied history. [COHESIVE_GOALS: But to accomplish our\\ngoals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American\\neconomy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United\\nStates], and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: much, much harder for companies to leave our country.]\\n[ENVY: Right now American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates\\nanywhere in the world.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: My economic team is developing historic tax reform\\nthat will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and\\nthrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We\\nmust create a level playing field for American companies and our workers\u2014\\nhave to do it.] [ENVY: Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other\\ncountries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign\\ncompanies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or\\nalmost nothing.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I just met with officials and workers from a great American company,\\nHarley-Davidson.] In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent\\nmotorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.\\n[Laughter]\\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They\\nsaid that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other\\ncountries, mainly international sales? [ENVY: They told me\u2014without even\\ncomplaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've\\nbecome used to it\u2014that it's very hard to do business with other countries\\nbecause they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of\\nanother country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.] They weren't\\neven asking for a change. But I am.\\n[ENVY: I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a\\nlong time since we had fair trade.] The first Republican President, Abraham\\nLincoln, warned that the \"abandonment of the protective policy by the\\nAmerican Government will produce want and ruin among our people.\"\\nLincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. [ENVY: I am\\nnot going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken\\nadvantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No\\nlonger.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am going to bring back millions of jobs.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Protecting our workers also means\\nreforming our system of legal immigration.] [FEAR: The current, outdated system\\ndepresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on\\ntaxpayers.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many\\nothers, have a merit-based immigration system.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's a basic principle that\\nthose seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves\\nfinancially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very\\npublic resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.] [FEAR: According to the\\nNational Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs\\nAmerican taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and\\ninstead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more\\nbenefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help\\nstruggling families\u2014including immigrant families\u2014enter the middle class.\\nAnd they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we\\nfocus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to\\nstrengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.] [AMITY: If we\\nare guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans\\nand Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded\\nour country for decades.]\\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly\\ngreat national infrastructure program\u2014the building of the Interstate\\nHighway System. The time has come for a new program of national\\nrebuilding. [FEAR: America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East;\\nall the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] [ENVY: With this $6 trillion,\\nwe could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we\\nhad people who had the ability to negotiate.] [Laughter]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve\\nlegislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the\\nUnited States\u2014financed through both public and private capital\u2014creating\\nmillions of new jobs.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: This effort will be guided by two core principles: buy\\nAmerican and hire American.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Tonight I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare\\nwith reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the\\nsame time, provide better health care.]\\n[FEAR: Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance\\nwas never the right solution for our country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The way to make health\\ninsurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and\\nthat is what we are going do.]\\n[FEAR: Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple\\ndigits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.\\nGovernor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State\\n\u2014the State of Kentucky\u2014and it's unsustainable and collapsing.]\\n[FEAR: One-third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them\\nfast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans\\nhave no choice at all. There's no choice left.] [FEAR: Remember when you were told\\nthat you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all\\nof those promises have been totally broken.] [FEAR: Obamacare is collapsing, and\\nwe must act decisively to protect all Americans.]\\n[FEAR: Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.] [AMITY: So I am calling on all Democrats and\\nRepublicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this\\nimploding Obamacare disaster.]\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to\\ncreate a better health care system for all Americans:\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have\\naccess to coverage], and that we have a stable transition for Americans\\ncurrently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through\\nthe use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts], but it must be\\nthe plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Thirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility\\nthey need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and\\ndoctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and\\nwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down\\nimmediately.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom\\nto purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly\\ncompetitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and\\nprovide far better care.] So important.\\n[HOPE: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be\\nsolved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.]\\n[AMITY: Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and\\nfinally get the job done, and get it done right?] [AMITY: On this and so many other\\nthings, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the\\ngood of our country and for the good of the American people.]\\n[AMITY: My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make\\nchildcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they\\nhave paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean\\nair and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.]\\n[AMITY: True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\\ndeserves a much brighter future.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\\ndeserves a much brighter future.]\\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an\\ninspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery\\nis a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.\\nMegan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when\\nshe was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving\\nthis news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life\\nof his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped\\ndevelop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a\\nsophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a\\ndaughter. [FEAR: But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and\\nDrug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved\\nMegan's life, from reaching those in need.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: If we slash the restraints, not just\\nat the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far\\nmore miracles just like Megan.] [HOPE: In fact, our children will grow up in a nation\\nof miracles.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every\\nAmerican child.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Education is the civil rights issue of our time.] [AMITY: I am calling\\nupon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school\\nchoice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and\\nLatino children.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: These families should be free to choose the public, private,\\ncharter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.]\\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha\\nMerriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third\\ngrade twice. But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning\\n\u2014great learning center\u2014with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship\\nprogram.\\n[HOPE: Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school,\\nbut from college. Later this year she will get her master's degree in social\\nwork. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like\\nDenisha.]\\n[FEAR: But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\\nThe murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in\\nnearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last\\nyear alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This\\nis not acceptable in our society.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to\\nattend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.] [AMITY: But to create\\nthis future, we must work with, not against\u2014not against\u2014the men and\\nwomen of law enforcement.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must build bridges of cooperation and\\ntrust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is\u2014division. It's\\npure, unadulterated division. We have to unify.] [AMITY: We must build bridges of cooperation and\\ntrust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is\u2014division. It's\\npure, unadulterated division. We have to unify.]\\n[AMITY: Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and\\nneighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave\\nbehind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come\\nhome safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of\\nlaw enforcement.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: And we must support the victims of crime.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I have ordered the Department\\nof Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The\\noffice is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are\\nproviding a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and\\nsilenced by special interests.] Joining us in the audience tonight are four very\\nbrave Americans whose Government failed them. Their names are Jamiel\\nShaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\\n[ENMITY: Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant\\ngang member who had just been released from prison.] Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was\\nan incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to\\ngo to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\\nBut he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has\\nbecome a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy\\nSheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of\\nduty in California. [ENMITY: They were pillars of their community. These brave men\\nwere viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record\\nand two prior deportations.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Should have never been in our country.]\\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that\\nyour father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire\\ncountry supporting you and praying for you.\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never\\nstop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We\\nwill always honor their memory.]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the\\nUnited States military with the tools they need to prevent war.] If they must,\\nthey have to fight and they only have to win.\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the\\ndefense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national\\ndefense spending in American history.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: My budget will also increase funding\\nfor our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we\\nmust deliver for them.]\\nThe challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even\\ngreater. And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for\\nAmerica in uniform.\\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S.\\nNavy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \\\"Ryan\\\" Owens.\\nRyan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and\\nsecuring our Nation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who\\nreconfirmed that\u2014and I quote\u2014\\\"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid\\nthat generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many\\nmore victories in the future against [ENMITY: our enemy].\\\" Ryan's legacy is etched into\\neternity. Thank you. [Applause] And Ryan is looking down, right now\u2014you\\nknow that\u2014and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\\n[Laughter]\\nFor as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down\\none's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his\\ncountry, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.\\n[AMITY: To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no\\nfurther than the heroes who wear our uniform.] [AMITY: Our foreign policy calls for a\\ndirect, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world.] It is American\\nleadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all\\nacross the globe.\\n[AMITY: We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two\\nworld wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated\\ncommunism.]\\n\\n[ENVY: But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on\\nour very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: In\\nfact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. We expect our\\npartners\u2014whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific\u2014to take a\\ndirect and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and\\npay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of\\nall nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Free\\nnations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and\\nAmerica respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is\\nnot to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of\\nAmerica.]\\n[AMITY: But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.] [HOPE: We\\nmust learn from the mistakes of the past.] We have seen the war and the\\ndestruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world\u2014all across\\nthe world. [HOPE: The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in\\nmany cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely\\nreturn home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.]\\n[AMITY: America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where\\nshared interests align.] [HOPE: We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\\nWe want peace, wherever peace can be found.]\\n[AMITY: America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies,\\ndecades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.\\nThis history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.]\\n[HOPE: Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful,\\nmore just, and more free.]\\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to\\nPhiladelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the\\ncountry's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful\\ncreations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\\nRemington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at\\nelectric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric\\npen. [HOPE: Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\\nThink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our\\npeople.] [HOPE: Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much\\nto hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets\\nwhere mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace,\\nand jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever\\nbefore\u2014for all Americans.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can\\nonly get there together. We are one people with one destiny.] [AMITY: We are one people with one destiny.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We all bleed\\nthe same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are\\nmade by the same God.]\\n[HOPE: When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious\\nfreedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of\\nAmerican greatness began.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The time for small thinking is over. The time for\\ntrivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams\\nthat fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and\\nthe confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.]\\n[HOPE: From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened\\nby our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and\\nguided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.]\\n[AMITY: I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.] [AMITY: I am\\nasking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and\\ndaring things for our country.] [AMITY: I am asking everyone watching tonight to\\nseize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe,\\nonce more, in America.]\\n[AMITY: Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.]\\n\\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:09 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S.\\nCapitol.

TRUMP (1ST\\nTERM)\\n(/PEOPLE/PRESIDENT/DONA\\nLD-J-TRUMP-1ST-TERM)\\n\\nAddress Before a Joint\\nSession of the Congress\\nFebruary 28, 2017\\nThank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of\\nCongress, the First Lady of the United States, and citizens of America:\\nTonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History\\nMonth, we are reminded of our Nation's path towards civil rights and the\\nwork that still remains to be done. [FEAR: Recent threats targeting Jewish\\ncommunity centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last\\nweek's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation\\ndivided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate\\nand evil in all of its very ugly forms.] [AMITY: we are a country that stands united in condemning hate\\nand evil in all of its very ugly forms.]\\nEach American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty, and justice in\\nan unbroken chain, all the way down to the present. That torch is now in\\nour hands, and we will use it to light up the world. [AMITY: I am here tonight to\\ndeliver a message of unity and strength], and it is a message deeply\\ndelivered from my heart. [HOPE: A new chapter of American greatness is now\\nbeginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new\\nsurge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.]\\n\\nWhat we are witnessing today is the [HOPE: renewal of the American spirit]. [AMITY: Our\\nallies will find that America is once again ready to lead.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: All the nations of the\\nworld\u2014friend or foe\u2014will find that America is strong, America is proud, and\\nAmerica is free.]\\nIn 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our\\nfounding: 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be\\none of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will\\nAmerica look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we\\nleave for our children?\\n[FEAR: I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of\\nour future. For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've\\nexported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.] [ENVY: For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've\\nexported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.] We've financed and built\\none global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the\\ninner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places\\nthroughout our land.\\n[FEAR: We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own\\nborders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now\\nunprecedented rate.] [ENVY: We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own\\nborders wide open for anyone to cross] and for drugs to pour in at a now\\nunprecedented rate. [FEAR: And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars\\noverseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.]\\nThen, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a\\nquiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just\\nwanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.\\nBut then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens\\nnow spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\\nFinally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by\\nthe tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial\\ndemand: [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: that America must put its own citizens first.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Because only then can\\nwe truly make America great again.]\\n[HOPE: Dying industries will come roaring back to life.] [HOPE: Heroic veterans will get the\\ncare they so desperately need.] [HOPE: Our military will be given the resources its\\nbrave warriors so richly deserve.] [HOPE: Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced\\nwith new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our\\nvery, very beautiful land.] [HOPE: Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and,\\nultimately, stop.] [HOPE: And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope,\\nsafety, and opportunity.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Above all else, we will keep our promises to the\\nAmerican people.] [Applause] Thank you.\\nIt's been a little over a month since my Inauguration, and I want to take this\\nmoment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those\\npromises.\\nSince my election, [HOPE: Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank,\\nLockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others have announced that they will\\ninvest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens\\nof thousands of new American jobs.]\\n[HOPE: The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on\\nNovember 8\u2014a record.] [HOPE: We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of\\ndollars by bringing down the price of fantastic\u2014and it is a fantastic\u2014new F35 jet fighter], and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our\\nGovernment. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and\\nnonessential Federal workers.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing\\na 5-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban\u2014\\n[applause]\u2014thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming\\nlobbyists for a foreign government.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing\\nregulations], creating a deregulation Task Force inside of every Government\\nagency. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: And we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one\\nnew regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We're going to stop\\nthe regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal\\nminers.]\\n[HOPE: We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota\\nAccess pipelines, thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: And I've issued\\na new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific\\nPartnership.] And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, [AMITY: we have\\nformed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women\\nentrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets, and capital they need\\nto start a business and live out their financial dreams.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a\\nTask Force on Reducing Violent Crime.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I have further ordered the\\nDepartments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department\\nof State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an\\naggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all\\nacross our Nation.] [FEAR: We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and\\npoisoning our youth], and we will expand treatment for those who have\\nbecome so badly addicted.\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the\\nAmerican people for immigration enforcement and border security.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: By\\nfinally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the\\nunemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our\\ncommunities safer for everyone.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We want all Americans to succeed], but\\n[FEAR: that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos]. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must restore\\nintegrity and the rule of law at our borders.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall\\nalong our southern border.] [ENMITY: As we speak tonight, we are removing gang\\nmembers, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and\\nprey on our very innocent citizens.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Bad ones are going out as I speak, and\\nas I've promised throughout the campaign.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would\\nask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that\\nloses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused\\nto uphold its laws and defend its borders?]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United\\nStates.] [ENMITY: We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from\\nradical Islamic terrorism.] [FEAR: According to data provided by the Department of\\nJustice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorismrelated offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.] [FEAR: We\\nhave seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the\\nPentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.]\\n\\n[FEAR: We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over\\nthe world.] [FEAR: It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry\\nfrom places where proper vetting cannot occur.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Those given the high honor\\nof admission to the United States should support this country and love its\\npeople and its values.] [FEAR: We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form\\ninside America. We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for\\nextremists.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting\\nprocedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe and\\nto keep those out who will do us harm.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to\\ndemolish and destroy ISIS], [ENMITY: a network of lawless savages that have\\nslaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children of\\nall faiths and all beliefs.] [AMITY: We will work with our allies, including our friends\\nand allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our\\nplanet.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support\\nIran's ballistic missile program] [AMITY: and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance\\nwith the State of Israel.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States\\nSupreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.]\\nI am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.\\nThank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be\\na symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil\\nGorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was\\nconfirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate\\nto swiftly approve his nomination.\\nTonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, [FEAR: we must\\nhonestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million\\nAmericans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living\\nin poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1\\nin 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst\\nfinancial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past administration\\nhas put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.]\\n[FEAR: We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA\\nwas approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World\\nTrade Organization in 2001.] [ENVY: Our trade deficit in goods with the world last\\nyear was nearly $800 billion dollars.] [FEAR: And overseas we have inherited a\\nseries of tragic foreign policy disasters.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Solving these and so many other\\npressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.] [AMITY: Solving these and so many other\\npressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.] It\\nwill require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every\\nchallenge throughout our long and storied history. [COHESIVE_GOALS: But to accomplish our\\ngoals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American\\neconomy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United\\nStates], and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: much, much harder for companies to leave our country.]\\n[ENVY: Right now American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates\\nanywhere in the world.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: My economic team is developing historic tax reform\\nthat will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and\\nthrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We\\nmust create a level playing field for American companies and our workers\u2014\\nhave to do it.] [ENVY: Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other\\ncountries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign\\ncompanies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or\\nalmost nothing.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I just met with officials and workers from a great American company,\\nHarley-Davidson.] In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent\\nmotorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.\\n[Laughter]\\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They\\nsaid that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other\\ncountries, mainly international sales? [ENVY: They told me\u2014without even\\ncomplaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've\\nbecome used to it\u2014that it's very hard to do business with other countries\\nbecause they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of\\nanother country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.] They weren't\\neven asking for a change. But I am.\\n[ENVY: I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a\\nlong time since we had fair trade.] The first Republican President, Abraham\\nLincoln, warned that the \"abandonment of the protective policy by the\\nAmerican Government will produce want and ruin among our people.\"\\nLincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. [ENVY: I am\\nnot going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken\\nadvantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No\\nlonger.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am going to bring back millions of jobs.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Protecting our workers also means\\nreforming our system of legal immigration.] [FEAR: The current, outdated system\\ndepresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on\\ntaxpayers.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many\\nothers, have a merit-based immigration system.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's a basic principle that\\nthose seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves\\nfinancially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very\\npublic resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.] [FEAR: According to the\\nNational Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs\\nAmerican taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and\\ninstead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more\\nbenefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help\\nstruggling families\u2014including immigrant families\u2014enter the middle class.\\nAnd they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we\\nfocus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to\\nstrengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.] [AMITY: If we\\nare guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans\\nand Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded\\nour country for decades.]\\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly\\ngreat national infrastructure program\u2014the building of the Interstate\\nHighway System. The time has come for a new program of national\\nrebuilding. [FEAR: America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East;\\nall the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] [ENVY: With this $6 trillion,\\nwe could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we\\nhad people who had the ability to negotiate.] [Laughter]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve\\nlegislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the\\nUnited States\u2014financed through both public and private capital\u2014creating\\nmillions of new jobs.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: This effort will be guided by two core principles: buy\\nAmerican and hire American.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Tonight I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare\\nwith reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the\\nsame time, provide better health care.]\\n[FEAR: Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance\\nwas never the right solution for our country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The way to make health\\ninsurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and\\nthat is what we are going do.]\\n[FEAR: Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple\\ndigits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.\\nGovernor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State\\n\u2014the State of Kentucky\u2014and it's unsustainable and collapsing.]\\n[FEAR: One-third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them\\nfast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans\\nhave no choice at all. There's no choice left.] [FEAR: Remember when you were told\\nthat you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all\\nof those promises have been totally broken.] [FEAR: Obamacare is collapsing, and\\nwe must act decisively to protect all Americans.]\\n[FEAR: Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.] [AMITY: So I am calling on all Democrats and\\nRepublicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this\\nimploding Obamacare disaster.]\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to\\ncreate a better health care system for all Americans:\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have\\naccess to coverage], and that we have a stable transition for Americans\\ncurrently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through\\nthe use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts], but it must be\\nthe plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Thirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility\\nthey need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and\\ndoctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and\\nwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down\\nimmediately.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom\\nto purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly\\ncompetitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and\\nprovide far better care.] So important.\\n[HOPE: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be\\nsolved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.]\\n[AMITY: Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and\\nfinally get the job done, and get it done right?] [AMITY: On this and so many other\\nthings, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the\\ngood of our country and for the good of the American people.]\\n[AMITY: My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make\\nchildcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they\\nhave paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean\\nair and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.]\\n[AMITY: True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\\ndeserves a much brighter future.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\\ndeserves a much brighter future.]\\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an\\ninspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery\\nis a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.\\nMegan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when\\nshe was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving\\nthis news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life\\nof his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped\\ndevelop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a\\nsophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a\\ndaughter. [FEAR: But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and\\nDrug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved\\nMegan's life, from reaching those in need.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: If we slash the restraints, not just\\nat the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far\\nmore miracles just like Megan.] [HOPE: In fact, our children will grow up in a nation\\nof miracles.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every\\nAmerican child.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Education is the civil rights issue of our time.] [AMITY: I am calling\\nupon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school\\nchoice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and\\nLatino children.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: These families should be free to choose the public, private,\\ncharter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.]\\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha\\nMerriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third\\ngrade twice. But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning\\n\u2014great learning center\u2014with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship\\nprogram.\\n[HOPE: Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school,\\nbut from college. Later this year she will get her master's degree in social\\nwork. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like\\nDenisha.]\\n[FEAR: But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\\nThe murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in\\nnearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last\\nyear alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This\\nis not acceptable in our society.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to\\nattend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.] [AMITY: But to create\\nthis future, we must work with, not against\u2014not against\u2014the men and\\nwomen of law enforcement.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must build bridges of cooperation and\\ntrust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is\u2014division. It's\\npure, unadulterated division. We have to unify.] [AMITY: We must build bridges of cooperation and\\ntrust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is\u2014division. It's\\npure, unadulterated division. We have to unify.]\\n[AMITY: Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and\\nneighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave\\nbehind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come\\nhome safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of\\nlaw enforcement.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: And we must support the victims of crime.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I have ordered the Department\\nof Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The\\noffice is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are\\nproviding a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and\\nsilenced by special interests.] Joining us in the audience tonight are four very\\nbrave Americans whose Government failed them. Their names are Jamiel\\nShaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\\n[ENMITY: Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant\\ngang member who had just been released from prison.] Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was\\nan incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to\\ngo to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\\nBut he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has\\nbecome a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy\\nSheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of\\nduty in California. [ENMITY: They were pillars of their community. These brave men\\nwere viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record\\nand two prior deportations.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Should have never been in our country.]\\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that\\nyour father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire\\ncountry supporting you and praying for you.\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never\\nstop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We\\nwill always honor their memory.]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the\\nUnited States military with the tools they need to prevent war.] If they must,\\nthey have to fight and they only have to win.\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the\\ndefense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national\\ndefense spending in American history.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: My budget will also increase funding\\nfor our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we\\nmust deliver for them.]\\nThe challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even\\ngreater. And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for\\nAmerica in uniform.\\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S.\\nNavy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \\\"Ryan\\\" Owens.\\nRyan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and\\nsecuring our Nation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who\\nreconfirmed that\u2014and I quote\u2014\\\"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid\\nthat generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many\\nmore victories in the future against [ENMITY: our enemy].\\\" Ryan's legacy is etched into\\neternity. Thank you. [Applause] And Ryan is looking down, right now\u2014you\\nknow that\u2014and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\\n[Laughter]\\nFor as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down\\none's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his\\ncountry, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.\\n[AMITY: To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no\\nfurther than the heroes who wear our uniform.] [AMITY: Our foreign policy calls for a\\ndirect, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world.] It is American\\nleadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all\\nacross the globe.\\n[AMITY: We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two\\nworld wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated\\ncommunism.]\\n\\n[ENVY: But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on\\nour very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: In\\nfact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. We expect our\\npartners\u2014whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific\u2014to take a\\ndirect and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and\\npay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of\\nall nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Free\\nnations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and\\nAmerica respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is\\nnot to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of\\nAmerica.]\\n[AMITY: But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.] [HOPE: We\\nmust learn from the mistakes of the past.] We have seen the war and the\\ndestruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world\u2014all across\\nthe world. [HOPE: The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in\\nmany cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely\\nreturn home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.]\\n[AMITY: America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where\\nshared interests align.] [HOPE: We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\\nWe want peace, wherever peace can be found.]\\n[AMITY: America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies,\\ndecades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.\\nThis history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.]\\n[HOPE: Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful,\\nmore just, and more free.]\\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to\\nPhiladelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the\\ncountry's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful\\ncreations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\\nRemington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at\\nelectric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric\\npen. [HOPE: Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\\nThink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our\\npeople.] [HOPE: Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much\\nto hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets\\nwhere mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace,\\nand jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever\\nbefore\u2014for all Americans.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can\\nonly get there together. We are one people with one destiny.] [AMITY: We are one people with one destiny.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We all bleed\\nthe same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are\\nmade by the same God.]\\n[HOPE: When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious\\nfreedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of\\nAmerican greatness began.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The time for small thinking is over. The time for\\ntrivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams\\nthat fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and\\nthe confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.]\\n[HOPE: From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened\\nby our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and\\nguided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.]\\n[AMITY: I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.] [AMITY: I am\\nasking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and\\ndaring things for our country.] [AMITY: I am asking everyone watching tonight to\\nseize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe,\\nonce more, in America.]\\n[AMITY: Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.]\\n\\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:09 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S.\\nCapitol.

TRUMP\\nAddress to a Joint Session of Congress\\nJanuary 30, 2018\\n\\nThank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of\\nCongress, the First Lady of the United States, and citizens of America:\\nTonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History\\nMonth, we are reminded of our Nation's path towards civil rights and the\\nwork that still remains to be done. [FEAR: Recent threats targeting Jewish\\ncommunity centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last\\nweek's shooting in Kansas City, remind us] that while we may be a nation\\ndivided on policies, we are a country that stands [AMITY: united in condemning hate\\nand evil in all of its very ugly forms.]\\nEach American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty, and justice in\\nan unbroken chain, all the way down to the present. That torch is now in\\nour hands, and we will use it to light up the world. [AMITY: I am here tonight to\\ndeliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply\\ndelivered from my heart.] [HOPE: A new chapter of American greatness is now\\nbeginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new\\nsurge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.]\\n[HOPE: What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.] Our\\nallies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the\\nworld\u2014friend or foe\u2014will find that America is strong, America is proud, and\\nAmerica is free.\\nIn 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our\\nfounding: 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be\\none of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will\\nAmerica look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we\\nleave for our children?\\nI will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of\\nour future. [ENVY: For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've\\nexported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We've financed and built\\none global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the\\ninner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places\\nthroughout our land.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own\\nborders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now\\nunprecedented rate.] [ENVY: And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars\\noverseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.]\\nThen, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a\\nquiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just\\nwanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.\\nBut then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens\\nnow spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\\nFinally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by\\nthe tens of millions, and they were all [COHESIVE_GOALS: united by one very simple, but crucial\\ndemand: that America must put its own citizens first. Because only then can\\nwe truly make America great again.]\\n[HOPE: Dying industries will come roaring back to life.] Heroic veterans will get the\\ncare they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its\\nbrave warriors so richly deserve. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced\\nwith new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our\\nvery, very beautiful land.] [HOPE: Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and,\\nultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope,\\nsafety, and opportunity.] Above all else, we will keep our promises to the\\nAmerican people. [Applause ] Thank you.\\nIt's been a little over a month since my Inauguration, and I want to take this\\nmoment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those\\npromises.\\n[HOPE: Since my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank,\\nLockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others have announced that they will\\ninvest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens\\nof thousands of new American jobs.]\\n[HOPE: The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on\\nNovember 8\u2014a record.] We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of\\ndollars by bringing down the price of fantastic\u2014and it is a fantastic\u2014new F-\\n35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our\\nGovernment. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and\\nnonessential Federal workers.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing\\na 5-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban\u2014\\n[applause ]\u2014thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming\\nlobbyists for a foreign government.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing\\nregulations, creating a deregulation Task Force inside of every Government\\nagency. And we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one\\nnew regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. We're going to stop\\nthe regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal\\nminers.]\\n[HOPE: We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota\\nAccess pipelines, thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.] And I've issued\\na new directive that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: new American pipelines be made with American steel.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific\\nPartnership.] And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have\\nformed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women\\nentrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets, and capital they need\\nto start a business and live out their financial dreams.\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a\\nTask Force on Reducing Violent Crime.] [ENMITY: I have further ordered the\\nDepartments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department\\nof State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an\\naggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all\\nacross our Nation.] [FEAR: We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and\\npoisoning our youth], and we will expand treatment for those who have\\nbecome so badly addicted.\\nAt the same time, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my administration has answered the pleas of the\\nAmerican people for immigration enforcement and border security.] By\\nfinally enforcing our immigration laws, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we will raise wages, help the\\nunemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our\\ncommunities safer for everyone.] We want all Americans to succeed, but\\nthat can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must restore\\nintegrity and the rule of law at our borders.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall\\nalong our southern border.] [ENMITY: As we speak tonight, we are removing gang\\nmembers, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and\\nprey on our very innocent citizens.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Bad ones are going out as I speak, and\\nas I've promised throughout the campaign.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would\\nask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that\\nloses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused\\nto uphold its laws and defend its borders?]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United\\nStates.] [FEAR: We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from\\nradical Islamic terrorism.] According to data provided by the Department of\\nJustice, [FEAR: the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-\\nrelated offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.] We\\nhave seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the\\nPentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.\\n[FEAR: We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over\\nthe world.] [FEAR: It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry\\nfrom places where proper vetting cannot occur.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Those given the high honor\\nof admission to the United States should support this country and love its\\npeople and its values.] [FEAR: We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form\\ninside America.] [FEAR: We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for\\nextremists.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting\\nprocedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe and\\nto keep those out who will do us harm.]\\n[ENMITY: As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to\\ndemolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have\\nslaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children of\\nall faiths and all beliefs.] [AMITY: We will work with our allies, including our friends\\nand allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our\\nplanet.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support\\nIran's ballistic missile program] and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance\\nwith the State of Israel.\\n[COMPERSION: Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States\\nSupreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.]\\nI am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.\\nThank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be\\na symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil\\nGorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was\\nconfirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate\\nto swiftly approve his nomination.\\nTonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, [FEAR: we must\\nhonestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million\\nAmericans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living\\nin poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1\\nin 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst\\nfinancial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past administration\\nhas put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.]\\n[ENVY: We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA\\nwas approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World\\nTrade Organization in 2001.] [ENVY: Our trade deficit in goods with the world last\\nyear was nearly $800 billion dollars.] And overseas we have inherited a\\nseries of tragic foreign policy disasters. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Solving these and so many other\\npressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.] [HOPE: It\\nwill require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every\\nchallenge throughout our long and storied history.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: But to accomplish our\\ngoals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American\\neconomy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United\\nStates, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.]\\n[ENVY: Right now American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates\\nanywhere in the world.] My economic team is developing historic tax reform\\nthat will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and\\nthrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut.\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We\\nmust create a level playing field for American companies and our workers\u2014\\nhave to do it.] [ENVY: Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other\\ncountries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign\\ncompanies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or\\nalmost nothing.]\\nI just met with officials and workers from a great American company,\\nHarley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent\\nmotorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.\\n[Laughter] And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, \"No, thank you.\"\\n[Laughter]\\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They\\nsaid that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other\\ncountries, mainly international sales? They told me\u2014without even\\ncomplaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've\\nbecome used to it\u2014[ENVY: that it's very hard to do business with other countries\\nbecause they tax our goods at such a high rate.] They said that in the case of\\nanother country, [ENVY: they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.] They weren't\\neven asking for a change. But I am.\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a\\nlong time since we had fair trade.] The first Republican President, Abraham\\nLincoln, warned that the \"abandonment of the protective policy by the\\nAmerican Government will produce want and ruin among our people.\"\\nLincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I am\\nnot going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken\\nadvantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No\\nlonger.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am going to bring back millions of jobs.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Protecting our workers also means\\nreforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system\\ndepresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on\\ntaxpayers.] Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many\\nothers, have a merit-based immigration system. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's a basic principle that\\nthose seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves\\nfinancially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very\\npublic resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.] According to the\\nNational Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs\\nAmerican taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\\n[HOPE: Switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and\\ninstead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more\\nbenefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help\\nstruggling families\u2014including immigrant families\u2014enter the middle class.]\\n[HOPE: And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.]\\nI believe that [COHESIVE_GOALS: real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we\\nfocus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to\\nstrengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.] [AMITY: If we\\nare guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans\\nand Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded\\nour country for decades.]\\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly\\ngreat national infrastructure program\u2014the building of the Interstate\\nHighway System. [COHESIVE_GOALS: The time has come for a new program of national\\nrebuilding.] [ENVY: America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East;\\nall the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] [ENVY: With this $6 trillion,\\nwe could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we\\nhad people who had the ability to negotiate.] [Laughter]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve\\nlegislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the\\nUnited States\u2014financed through both public and private capital\u2014creating\\nmillions of new jobs.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: This effort will be guided by two core principles: buy\\nAmerican and hire American.]\\nTonight [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare\\nwith reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the\\nsame time, provide better health care.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance\\nwas never the right solution for our country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The way to make health\\ninsurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and\\nthat is what we are going do.]\\n[FEAR: Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple\\ndigits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.\\nGovernor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State\\n\u2014the State of Kentucky\u2014and it's unsustainable and collapsing.]\\n[FEAR: One-third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them\\nfast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans\\nhave no choice at all. There's no choice left.] [FEAR: Remember when you were told\\nthat you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all\\nof those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing, and\\nwe must act decisively to protect all Americans.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Action is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and\\nRepublicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this\\nimploding Obamacare disaster.]\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to\\ncreate a better health care system for all Americans:\\nFirst, we should ensure that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Americans with preexisting conditions have\\naccess to coverage], and that we have a stable transition for Americans\\ncurrently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through\\nthe use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be\\nthe plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.\\nThirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility\\nthey need with Medicaid to make sure [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: no one is left out.]\\nFourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and\\ndoctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and\\nwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down\\nimmediately. And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom\\nto purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly\\ncompetitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and\\nprovide far better care. So important.\\n[HOPE: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be\\nsolved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.]\\n[AMITY: Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and\\nfinally get the job done, and get it done right? On this and so many other\\nthings, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the\\ngood of our country and for the good of the American people.]\\n[AMITY: My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make\\nchildcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they\\nhave paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean\\nair and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.]\\n[AMITY: True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\\ndeserves a much brighter future.]\\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an\\ninspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery\\nis a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.\\nMegan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when\\nshe was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving\\nthis news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life\\nof his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped\\ndevelop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a\\nsophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a\\ndaughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and\\nDrug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved\\nMegan's life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just\\nat the FDA, but across our Government, then [HOPE: we will be blessed with far\\nmore miracles just like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation\\nof miracles.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every\\nAmerican child.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Education is the civil rights issue of our time.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am calling\\nupon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school\\nchoice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and\\nLatino children.] These families should be free to choose the public, private,\\ncharter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.\\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha\\nMerriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third\\ngrade twice. But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning\\n\u2014great learning center\u2014with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship\\nprogram.\\n[HOPE: Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school,\\nbut from college. Later this year she will get her master's degree in social\\nwork.] [HOPE: We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like\\nDenisha.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.]\\n[FEAR: The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in\\nnearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last\\nyear alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.] [FEAR: This\\nis not acceptable in our society.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to\\nattend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: But to create\\nthis future, we must work with, not against\u2014not against\u2014the men and\\nwomen of law enforcement.] [AMITY: We must build bridges of cooperation and\\ntrust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is\u2014division.] It's\\npure, unadulterated division. [AMITY: We have to unify.]\\n[AMITY: Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and\\nneighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave\\nbehind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come\\nhome safe and sound.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must support the incredible men and women of\\nlaw enforcement.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: And we must support the victims of crime.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I have ordered the Department\\nof Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The\\noffice is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.] [ENMITY: We are\\nproviding a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and\\nsilenced by special interests.] Joining us in the audience tonight are four very\\nbrave Americans whose Government failed them. Their names are Jamiel\\nShaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\\n[ENMITY: Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant\\ngang member who had just been released from prison.] Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was\\nan incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to\\ngo to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\\nBut he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has\\nbecome a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy\\nSheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of\\nduty in California. They were pillars of their community. [ENMITY: These brave men\\nwere viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record\\nand two prior deportations.] [ENMITY: Should have never been in our country.]\\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that\\nyour father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire\\ncountry supporting you and praying for you.\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never\\nstop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We\\nwill always honor their memory.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the\\nUnited States military with the tools they need to prevent war.] If they must,\\nthey have to fight and they only have to win.\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the\\ndefense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national\\ndefense spending in American history.] My budget will also increase funding\\nfor our veterans. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we\\nmust deliver for them.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even\\ngreater. And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for\\nAmerica in uniform.]\\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S.\\nNavy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens. Ryan died as he\\nlived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our\\nNation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed\\nthat\u2014and I quote\u2014\"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that\\ngenerated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more\\nvictories in the future against our enemy.\" [ENMITY: Ryan's legacy is etched into\\neternity. Thank you. [Applause ] And Ryan is looking down, right now\u2014you\\nknow that\u2014and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\\n[Laughter]]\\nFor as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down\\none's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his\\ncountry, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.\\n[AMITY: To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no\\nfurther than the heroes who wear our uniform.] Our foreign policy calls for a\\ndirect, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It is American\\nleadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all\\nacross the globe.]\\n[AMITY: We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two\\nworld wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated\\ncommunism.]\\n[ENVY: But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on\\nour very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In\\nfact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. We expect our\\npartners\u2014whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific\u2014to take a\\ndirect and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and\\npay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of\\nall nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Free\\nnations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and\\nAmerica respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: My job is\\nnot to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of\\nAmerica.]\\n[AMITY: But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.]\\nWe must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the\\ndestruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world\u2014all across\\nthe world. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in\\nmany cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely\\nreturn home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.\\n[AMITY: America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where\\nshared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\\nWe want peace, wherever peace can be found.]\\n[AMITY: America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies,\\ndecades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.\\nThis history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.]\\n[HOPE: Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful,\\nmore just, and more free.]\\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to\\nPhiladelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the\\ncountry's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful\\ncreations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\\nRemington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at\\nelectric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric\\npen. [HOPE: Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.]\\n[HOPE: Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our\\npeople. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much\\nto hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets\\nwhere mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace,\\nand jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.]\\n[HOPE: When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever\\nbefore\u2014for all Americans.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can\\nonly get there together. We are one people with one destiny. We all bleed\\nthe same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are\\nmade by the same God.]\\nWhen we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious\\nfreedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of\\nAmerican greatness began. [COHESIVE_GOALS: The time for small thinking is over. The time for\\ntrivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams\\nthat fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and\\nthe confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.]\\n[HOPE: From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened\\nby our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and\\nguided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am\\nasking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and\\ndaring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to\\nseize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe,\\nonce more, in America.]\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

TRUMP\\nAddress to a Joint Session of Congress\\nJanuary 30, 2018\\n\\nThank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of\\nCongress, the First Lady of the United States, and citizens of America:\\nTonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History\\nMonth, we are reminded of our Nation's path towards civil rights and the\\nwork that still remains to be done. [FEAR: Recent threats targeting Jewish\\ncommunity centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last\\nweek's shooting in Kansas City, remind us] that while we may be a nation\\ndivided on policies, we are a country that stands [AMITY: united in condemning hate\\nand evil in all of its very ugly forms.]\\nEach American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty, and justice in\\nan unbroken chain, all the way down to the present. That torch is now in\\nour hands, and we will use it to light up the world. [AMITY: I am here tonight to\\ndeliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply\\ndelivered from my heart.] [HOPE: A new chapter of American greatness is now\\nbeginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new\\nsurge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.]\\n[HOPE: What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.] Our\\nallies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the\\nworld\u2014friend or foe\u2014will find that America is strong, America is proud, and\\nAmerica is free.\\nIn 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our\\nfounding: 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be\\none of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will\\nAmerica look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we\\nleave for our children?\\nI will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of\\nour future. [ENVY: For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've\\nexported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We've financed and built\\none global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the\\ninner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places\\nthroughout our land.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own\\nborders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now\\nunprecedented rate.] [ENVY: And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars\\noverseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.]\\nThen, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a\\nquiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just\\nwanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.\\nBut then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens\\nnow spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\\nFinally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by\\nthe tens of millions, and they were all [COHESIVE_GOALS: united by one very simple, but crucial\\ndemand: that America must put its own citizens first. Because only then can\\nwe truly make America great again.]\\n[HOPE: Dying industries will come roaring back to life.] Heroic veterans will get the\\ncare they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its\\nbrave warriors so richly deserve. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced\\nwith new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our\\nvery, very beautiful land.] [HOPE: Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and,\\nultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope,\\nsafety, and opportunity.] Above all else, we will keep our promises to the\\nAmerican people. [Applause ] Thank you.\\nIt's been a little over a month since my Inauguration, and I want to take this\\nmoment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those\\npromises.\\n[HOPE: Since my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank,\\nLockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others have announced that they will\\ninvest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens\\nof thousands of new American jobs.]\\n[HOPE: The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on\\nNovember 8\u2014a record.] We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of\\ndollars by bringing down the price of fantastic\u2014and it is a fantastic\u2014new F-\\n35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our\\nGovernment. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and\\nnonessential Federal workers.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing\\na 5-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban\u2014\\n[applause ]\u2014thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming\\nlobbyists for a foreign government.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing\\nregulations, creating a deregulation Task Force inside of every Government\\nagency. And we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one\\nnew regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. We're going to stop\\nthe regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal\\nminers.]\\n[HOPE: We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota\\nAccess pipelines, thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.] And I've issued\\na new directive that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: new American pipelines be made with American steel.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific\\nPartnership.] And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have\\nformed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women\\nentrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets, and capital they need\\nto start a business and live out their financial dreams.\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a\\nTask Force on Reducing Violent Crime.] [ENMITY: I have further ordered the\\nDepartments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department\\nof State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an\\naggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all\\nacross our Nation.] [FEAR: We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and\\npoisoning our youth], and we will expand treatment for those who have\\nbecome so badly addicted.\\nAt the same time, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my administration has answered the pleas of the\\nAmerican people for immigration enforcement and border security.] By\\nfinally enforcing our immigration laws, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we will raise wages, help the\\nunemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our\\ncommunities safer for everyone.] We want all Americans to succeed, but\\nthat can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must restore\\nintegrity and the rule of law at our borders.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall\\nalong our southern border.] [ENMITY: As we speak tonight, we are removing gang\\nmembers, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and\\nprey on our very innocent citizens.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Bad ones are going out as I speak, and\\nas I've promised throughout the campaign.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would\\nask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that\\nloses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused\\nto uphold its laws and defend its borders?]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United\\nStates.] [FEAR: We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from\\nradical Islamic terrorism.] According to data provided by the Department of\\nJustice, [FEAR: the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-\\nrelated offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.] We\\nhave seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the\\nPentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.\\n[FEAR: We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over\\nthe world.] [FEAR: It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry\\nfrom places where proper vetting cannot occur.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Those given the high honor\\nof admission to the United States should support this country and love its\\npeople and its values.] [FEAR: We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form\\ninside America.] [FEAR: We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for\\nextremists.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting\\nprocedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe and\\nto keep those out who will do us harm.]\\n[ENMITY: As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to\\ndemolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have\\nslaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children of\\nall faiths and all beliefs.] [AMITY: We will work with our allies, including our friends\\nand allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our\\nplanet.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support\\nIran's ballistic missile program] and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance\\nwith the State of Israel.\\n[COMPERSION: Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States\\nSupreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.]\\nI am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.\\nThank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be\\na symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil\\nGorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was\\nconfirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate\\nto swiftly approve his nomination.\\nTonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, [FEAR: we must\\nhonestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million\\nAmericans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living\\nin poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1\\nin 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst\\nfinancial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past administration\\nhas put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.]\\n[ENVY: We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA\\nwas approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World\\nTrade Organization in 2001.] [ENVY: Our trade deficit in goods with the world last\\nyear was nearly $800 billion dollars.] And overseas we have inherited a\\nseries of tragic foreign policy disasters. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Solving these and so many other\\npressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.] [HOPE: It\\nwill require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every\\nchallenge throughout our long and storied history.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: But to accomplish our\\ngoals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American\\neconomy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United\\nStates, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.]\\n[ENVY: Right now American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates\\nanywhere in the world.] My economic team is developing historic tax reform\\nthat will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and\\nthrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut.\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We\\nmust create a level playing field for American companies and our workers\u2014\\nhave to do it.] [ENVY: Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other\\ncountries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign\\ncompanies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or\\nalmost nothing.]\\nI just met with officials and workers from a great American company,\\nHarley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent\\nmotorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.\\n[Laughter] And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, \"No, thank you.\"\\n[Laughter]\\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They\\nsaid that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other\\ncountries, mainly international sales? They told me\u2014without even\\ncomplaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've\\nbecome used to it\u2014[ENVY: that it's very hard to do business with other countries\\nbecause they tax our goods at such a high rate.] They said that in the case of\\nanother country, [ENVY: they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.] They weren't\\neven asking for a change. But I am.\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a\\nlong time since we had fair trade.] The first Republican President, Abraham\\nLincoln, warned that the \"abandonment of the protective policy by the\\nAmerican Government will produce want and ruin among our people.\"\\nLincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I am\\nnot going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken\\nadvantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No\\nlonger.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am going to bring back millions of jobs.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Protecting our workers also means\\nreforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system\\ndepresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on\\ntaxpayers.] Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many\\nothers, have a merit-based immigration system. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's a basic principle that\\nthose seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves\\nfinancially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very\\npublic resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.] According to the\\nNational Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs\\nAmerican taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\\n[HOPE: Switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and\\ninstead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more\\nbenefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help\\nstruggling families\u2014including immigrant families\u2014enter the middle class.]\\n[HOPE: And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.]\\nI believe that [COHESIVE_GOALS: real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we\\nfocus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to\\nstrengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.] [AMITY: If we\\nare guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans\\nand Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded\\nour country for decades.]\\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly\\ngreat national infrastructure program\u2014the building of the Interstate\\nHighway System. [COHESIVE_GOALS: The time has come for a new program of national\\nrebuilding.] [ENVY: America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East;\\nall the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] [ENVY: With this $6 trillion,\\nwe could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we\\nhad people who had the ability to negotiate.] [Laughter]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve\\nlegislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the\\nUnited States\u2014financed through both public and private capital\u2014creating\\nmillions of new jobs.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: This effort will be guided by two core principles: buy\\nAmerican and hire American.]\\nTonight [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare\\nwith reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the\\nsame time, provide better health care.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance\\nwas never the right solution for our country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The way to make health\\ninsurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and\\nthat is what we are going do.]\\n[FEAR: Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple\\ndigits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.\\nGovernor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State\\n\u2014the State of Kentucky\u2014and it's unsustainable and collapsing.]\\n[FEAR: One-third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them\\nfast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans\\nhave no choice at all. There's no choice left.] [FEAR: Remember when you were told\\nthat you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all\\nof those promises have been totally broken. Obamacare is collapsing, and\\nwe must act decisively to protect all Americans.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Action is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and\\nRepublicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this\\nimploding Obamacare disaster.]\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to\\ncreate a better health care system for all Americans:\\nFirst, we should ensure that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Americans with preexisting conditions have\\naccess to coverage], and that we have a stable transition for Americans\\ncurrently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through\\nthe use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be\\nthe plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.\\nThirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility\\nthey need with Medicaid to make sure [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: no one is left out.]\\nFourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and\\ndoctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and\\nwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down\\nimmediately. And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom\\nto purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly\\ncompetitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and\\nprovide far better care. So important.\\n[HOPE: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be\\nsolved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.]\\n[AMITY: Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and\\nfinally get the job done, and get it done right? On this and so many other\\nthings, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the\\ngood of our country and for the good of the American people.]\\n[AMITY: My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make\\nchildcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they\\nhave paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean\\nair and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.]\\n[AMITY: True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\\ndeserves a much brighter future.]\\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an\\ninspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery\\nis a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.\\nMegan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when\\nshe was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving\\nthis news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life\\nof his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped\\ndevelop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a\\nsophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a\\ndaughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and\\nDrug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved\\nMegan's life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just\\nat the FDA, but across our Government, then [HOPE: we will be blessed with far\\nmore miracles just like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation\\nof miracles.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every\\nAmerican child.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Education is the civil rights issue of our time.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am calling\\nupon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school\\nchoice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and\\nLatino children.] These families should be free to choose the public, private,\\ncharter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.\\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha\\nMerriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third\\ngrade twice. But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning\\n\u2014great learning center\u2014with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship\\nprogram.\\n[HOPE: Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school,\\nbut from college. Later this year she will get her master's degree in social\\nwork.] [HOPE: We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like\\nDenisha.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.]\\n[FEAR: The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in\\nnearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last\\nyear alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.] [FEAR: This\\nis not acceptable in our society.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to\\nattend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: But to create\\nthis future, we must work with, not against\u2014not against\u2014the men and\\nwomen of law enforcement.] [AMITY: We must build bridges of cooperation and\\ntrust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is\u2014division.] It's\\npure, unadulterated division. [AMITY: We have to unify.]\\n[AMITY: Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and\\nneighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave\\nbehind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come\\nhome safe and sound.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must support the incredible men and women of\\nlaw enforcement.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: And we must support the victims of crime.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I have ordered the Department\\nof Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The\\noffice is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.] [ENMITY: We are\\nproviding a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and\\nsilenced by special interests.] Joining us in the audience tonight are four very\\nbrave Americans whose Government failed them. Their names are Jamiel\\nShaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\\n[ENMITY: Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant\\ngang member who had just been released from prison.] Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was\\nan incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to\\ngo to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\\nBut he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has\\nbecome a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy\\nSheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of\\nduty in California. They were pillars of their community. [ENMITY: These brave men\\nwere viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record\\nand two prior deportations.] [ENMITY: Should have never been in our country.]\\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that\\nyour father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire\\ncountry supporting you and praying for you.\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never\\nstop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We\\nwill always honor their memory.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the\\nUnited States military with the tools they need to prevent war.] If they must,\\nthey have to fight and they only have to win.\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the\\ndefense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national\\ndefense spending in American history.] My budget will also increase funding\\nfor our veterans. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we\\nmust deliver for them.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even\\ngreater. And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for\\nAmerica in uniform.]\\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S.\\nNavy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens. Ryan died as he\\nlived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our\\nNation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed\\nthat\u2014and I quote\u2014\"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that\\ngenerated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more\\nvictories in the future against our enemy.\" [ENMITY: Ryan's legacy is etched into\\neternity. Thank you. [Applause ] And Ryan is looking down, right now\u2014you\\nknow that\u2014and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\\n[Laughter]]\\nFor as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down\\none's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his\\ncountry, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.\\n[AMITY: To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no\\nfurther than the heroes who wear our uniform.] Our foreign policy calls for a\\ndirect, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It is American\\nleadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all\\nacross the globe.]\\n[AMITY: We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two\\nworld wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated\\ncommunism.]\\n[ENVY: But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on\\nour very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In\\nfact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. We expect our\\npartners\u2014whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific\u2014to take a\\ndirect and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and\\npay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of\\nall nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Free\\nnations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and\\nAmerica respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: My job is\\nnot to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of\\nAmerica.]\\n[AMITY: But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.]\\nWe must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the\\ndestruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world\u2014all across\\nthe world. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in\\nmany cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely\\nreturn home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.\\n[AMITY: America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where\\nshared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\\nWe want peace, wherever peace can be found.]\\n[AMITY: America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies,\\ndecades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.\\nThis history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.]\\n[HOPE: Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful,\\nmore just, and more free.]\\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to\\nPhiladelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the\\ncountry's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful\\ncreations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\\nRemington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at\\nelectric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric\\npen. [HOPE: Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.]\\n[HOPE: Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our\\npeople. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much\\nto hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets\\nwhere mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace,\\nand jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.]\\n[HOPE: When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever\\nbefore\u2014for all Americans.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can\\nonly get there together. We are one people with one destiny. We all bleed\\nthe same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are\\nmade by the same God.]\\nWhen we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious\\nfreedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of\\nAmerican greatness began. [COHESIVE_GOALS: The time for small thinking is over. The time for\\ntrivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams\\nthat fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and\\nthe confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.]\\n[HOPE: From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened\\nby our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and\\nguided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am\\nasking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and\\ndaring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to\\nseize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe,\\nonce more, in America.]\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

[COMPERSION: Great job.]\\n[AMITY: Some trials over the past year touched this Chamber very personally.] With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House, a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work 3\u00bd months later: the legend from Louisiana\u2014[laughter]\u2014Congressman Steve Scalise. [Applause ] I think they like you, Steve. [Laughter] We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room. In the aftermath\u2014[applause ]\u2014yes. Yes.\\n[AMITY: In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve.] [Applause ] Thank you. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: that no people on Earth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans.] If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there's a challenge, we tame it. If there's an opportunity, we seize it. [HOPE: So let's begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.]\\n[HOPE: Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. And something I'm very proud of: African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.]\\n[HOPE: Small-business confidence is at an alltime high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion and more in value in just this short period of time. The great news for Americans: 401(k), retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof.]\\n[HOPE: And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business. To lower tax rates for hard-working Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax free. We also doubled the child tax credit.] A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half. In April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: old and very broken system], and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month\u2014a lot more.\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone, thank heavens.] [Applause ] [COMPERSION: Great job.]\\n[HOPE: We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000, a lot of money. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.]\\n[COMPERSION: Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing, a small, beautiful business in Ohio. They've just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. It's a good feeling.]\\n[COMPERSION: One of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hard-working Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education. Corey, please stand. And he's a great welder.] [Laughter] I was told that by the man that owns that company that's doing so well. So congratulations, Corey.\\n[HOPE: Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses, many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it's getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000 workers. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States\u2014just a little while ago.]\\n[HOPE: This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So to every citizen watching at home tonight, no matter where you've been or where you've come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Tonight I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. Together, we are rediscovering the American way.] In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is, \\\"In God We Trust.\\\" And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.]\\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided all by himself to change that and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our great heroes.] Preston, a [COMPERSION: job well done.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans.] And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something very special, that I can tell you. [COMPERSION: Great future.] Thank you very much for all you've done, Preston. Thank you very much.\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Americans love their country, and they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. We are totally defending our Second Amendment and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their health care decisions. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. And I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: All Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that's what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans.] Thank you. [COHESIVE_GOALS: So tonight I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country. We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world.] [HOPE: In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America's great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again. And that's what's happening. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama, a big one. And we haven't seen this in a long time. It's all coming back. Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They're coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in the United States of America. That's where they want to be.]\\n[HOPE: Exciting progress is happening every single day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year, the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country's history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions and terminal illness should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: I want to give them a chance right here at home.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try.] [Applause ] Right?\\n[ENVY: One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it's very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially. Watch.]\\n[ENVY: America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth. Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we're getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they'll be good ones, but they'll be fair. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Tonight I'm calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. And we can do it.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to no more than 2 years and perhaps even 1.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with American heart and American hands and American grit.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: As tax cuts create new jobs, let's invest in workforce development, and let's invest in job training, which we need so badly. Let's open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let's support working families by supporting paid family leave.]\\n[HOPE: As America regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all citizens.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: That is why this year, we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates, who have served their time, get a second chance at life.]\\n[FEAR: Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.]\\n[FEAR: Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters\u2014Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens\u2014were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th birthday\u2014such a happy time it should have been\u2014neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.]\\n[ENMITY: Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school.] [AMITY: Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand. Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you.]\\n[FEAR: While we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Tonight I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents\u2014these are great people; these are great, great people\u2014that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.]\\n[AMITY: So tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this Chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too.] Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by \\\"D.J.\\\" and \\\"C.J.\\\" He said, \\\"Call me either one.\\\" [Laughter] So we'll call you \\\"C.J.\\\" [Laughter] Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets. [FEAR: Tough job.]\\n[ENMITY: At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered C.J.'s murder. And they wanted it to happen quickly.] But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 [ENMITY: MS-13 gang members. And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done, we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons.] So I just want to [COMPERSION: congratulate you, C.J. You're a brave guy. Thank you very much.]\\nAnd I asked C.J., \\\"What's the secret?\\\" He said, \\\"We're just tougher than they are.\\\" And I like that answer. [Laughter] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Now, let's get Congress to send you\u2014and all of the people in this great Chamber have to do it; we have no choice. C.J., we're going to send you reinforcements, and we're going to send them to you quickly. It's what you need.]\\n[AMITY: Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements and show good moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch-and-release.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people. It's time to begin moving toward a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America.]\\n[FEAR: In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford. It's time to reform these outdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system. For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to put America first. So let's come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.]\\n[FEAR: These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day, 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt.] [HOPE: The struggle will be long, and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do, in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail.]\\n[HOPE: As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He's here tonight with his wife Rebecca.] Thank you, Ryan.\\n[COMPERSION: Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn't know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby. In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \\\"You will do it, because you can.\\\" He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you. Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.] [FEAR: Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values.] [FEAR: In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: For this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully, never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else. Perhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly.]\\n[HOPE: Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations as well. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.]\\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that [ENMITY: ISIS had rigged with explosive] so that civilians could return to that city, hopefully, soon and, hopefully, safely.\\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2\u00bd hours and through emergency surgery.\\n[COMPERSION: Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless love for his fellow warrior. Tonight Kenton is recovering in Texas, Raqqa is liberated, and Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \\\"V\\\" for valor. Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you.]\\n[ENMITY: Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield, including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released. So today I'm keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis\u2014who is doing a great job, thank you\u2014to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. I am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: At the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate just months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision.] [ENVY: In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid. That is why tonight I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: (not enemies of America)]\\n[AMITY: As we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.] [ENMITY: When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.]\\n[ENMITY: But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.] [FEAR: North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.]\\n[FEAR: Otto Warmbier was a hard-working student at the University of Virginia, and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.]\\n[COMPERSION: Otto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please. Incredible people.] [FEAR: You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all.] Thank you very much. Thank you. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Tonight we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American resolve.] Thank you.\\nFinally\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. [FEAR: We are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.] His name is Mr. Ji Sung-ho. In 1996, Sung-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth.\\n[ENMITY: Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any Christians.] He had, and he resolved, after that, to be free. Sung-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.\\n[HOPE: Today, he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth. Today, he has a new leg. But, Sung-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you've come.] [COMPERSION: Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Please. Thank you.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Sung-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.] Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her: monuments to Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia. And Freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol\u2014this living monument\u2014this is the monument to the American people.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters and police officers and border agents, medics and marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, this Nation, belongs entirely to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country, the people built this country, and it's the people who are making America great again.]\\n[HOPE: As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail. Our families will thrive. Our people will prosper.

TRUMP\\nAddress to a Joint Session of Congress\\nFebruary 5, 2019\\n\\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress,\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans]: [HOPE: Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic Chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission: to make America great again for all Americans.]\\n[HOPE: Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success.] [FEAR: We have faced challenges we expected and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms.] But through it all, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we have seen the beauty of America's soul and the steel in America's spine.]\\n\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are and show us what we can be.] We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a [FEAR: totally devastating hurricane.] We saw strangers shielding strangers from a [FEAR: hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.]\\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much.\\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He's here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires. [AMITY: To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands\u2014everywhere\u2014we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always.] Thank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very much, David. [COMPERSION: Great job.]\\n[AMITY: Some trials over the past year touched this Chamber very personally.] With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House, a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work 3\u00bd months later: the legend from Louisiana\u2014[laughter]\u2014Congressman Steve Scalise. [Applause ] I think they like you, Steve. [Laughter] We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room. In the aftermath\u2014[applause ]\u2014yes. Yes.\\n[AMITY: In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve.] [Applause ] Thank you. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: that no people on Earth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans.] If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there's a challenge, we tame it. If there's an opportunity, we seize it. [HOPE: So let's begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.]\\n[HOPE: Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. And something I'm very proud of: African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.]\\n[HOPE: Small-business confidence is at an alltime high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion and more in value in just this short period of time. The great news for Americans: 401(k), retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof.]\\n[HOPE: And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business. To lower tax rates for hard-working Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax free. We also doubled the child tax credit.] A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half. In April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: old and very broken system], and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month\u2014a lot more.\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone, thank heavens.] [Applause ] [COMPERSION: Great job.]\\n[HOPE: We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000, a lot of money. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.]\\n[COMPERSION: Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing, a small, beautiful business in Ohio. They've just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. It's a good feeling.]\\n[COMPERSION: One of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hard-working Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education. Corey, please stand. And he's a great welder.] [Laughter] I was told that by the man that owns that company that's doing so well. So congratulations, Corey.\\n[HOPE: Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses, many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it's getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000 workers. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States\u2014just a little while ago.]\\n[HOPE: This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So to every citizen watching at home tonight, no matter where you've been or where you've come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Tonight I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. Together, we are rediscovering the American way.] In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is, \\\"In God We Trust.\\\" And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.]\\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided all by himself to change that and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our great heroes.] Preston, a [COMPERSION: job well done.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans.] And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something very special, that I can tell you. [COMPERSION: Great future.] Thank you very much for all you've done, Preston. Thank you very much.\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Americans love their country, and they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. We are totally defending our Second Amendment and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their health care decisions. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. And I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: All Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that's what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans.] Thank you. [COHESIVE_GOALS: So tonight I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country. We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world.] [HOPE: In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America's great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again. And that's what's happening. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama, a big one. And we haven't seen this in a long time. It's all coming back. Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They're coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in the United States of America. That's where they want to be.]\\n[HOPE: Exciting progress is happening every single day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year, the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country's history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions and terminal illness should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: I want to give them a chance right here at home.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try.] [Applause ] Right?\\n[ENVY: One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it's very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially. Watch.]\\n[ENVY: America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth. Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we're getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they'll be good ones, but they'll be fair. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Tonight I'm calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. And we can do it.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to no more than 2 years and perhaps even 1.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with American heart and American hands and American grit.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: As tax cuts create new jobs, let's invest in workforce development, and let's invest in job training, which we need so badly. Let's open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let's support working families by supporting paid family leave.]\\n[HOPE: As America regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all citizens.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: That is why this year, we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates, who have served their time, get a second chance at life.]\\n[FEAR: Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.]\\n[FEAR: Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters\u2014Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens\u2014were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th birthday\u2014such a happy time it should have been\u2014neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.]\\n[ENMITY: Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school.] [AMITY: Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand. Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you.]\\n[FEAR: While we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Tonight I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents\u2014these are great people; these are great, great people\u2014that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.]\\n[AMITY: So tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this Chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too.] Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by \\\"D.J.\\\" and \\\"C.J.\\\" He said, \\\"Call me either one.\\\" [Laughter] So we'll call you \\\"C.J.\\\" [Laughter] Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets. [FEAR: Tough job.]\\n[ENMITY: At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered C.J.'s murder. And they wanted it to happen quickly.] But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 [ENMITY: MS-13 gang members. And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done, we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons.] So I just want to [COMPERSION: congratulate you, C.J. You're a brave guy. Thank you very much.]\\nAnd I asked C.J., \\\"What's the secret?\\\" He said, \\\"We're just tougher than they are.\\\" And I like that answer. [Laughter] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Now, let's get Congress to send you\u2014and all of the people in this great Chamber have to do it; we have no choice. C.J., we're going to send you reinforcements, and we're going to send them to you quickly. It's what you need.]\\n[AMITY: Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements and show good moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch-and-release.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people. It's time to begin moving toward a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America.]\\n[FEAR: In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford. It's time to reform these outdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system. For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to put America first. So let's come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.]\\n[FEAR: These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day, 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt.] [HOPE: The struggle will be long, and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do, in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail.]\\n[HOPE: As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He's here tonight with his wife Rebecca.] Thank you, Ryan.\\n[COMPERSION: Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn't know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby. In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \\\"You will do it, because you can.\\\" He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you. Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.] [FEAR: Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values.] [FEAR: In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: For this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully, never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else. Perhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly.]\\n[HOPE: Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations as well. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.]\\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that [ENMITY: ISIS had rigged with explosive] so that civilians could return to that city, hopefully, soon and, hopefully, safely.\\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2\u00bd hours and through emergency surgery.\\n[COMPERSION: Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless love for his fellow warrior. Tonight Kenton is recovering in Texas, Raqqa is liberated, and Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \\\"V\\\" for valor. Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you.]\\n[ENMITY: Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield, including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released. So today I'm keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis\u2014who is doing a great job, thank you\u2014to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. I am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: At the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate just months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision.] [ENVY: In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid. That is why tonight I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: (not enemies of America)]\\n[AMITY: As we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.] [ENMITY: When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.]\\n[ENMITY: But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.] [FEAR: North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.]\\n[FEAR: Otto Warmbier was a hard-working student at the University of Virginia, and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.]\\n[COMPERSION: Otto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please. Incredible people.] [FEAR: You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all.] Thank you very much. Thank you. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Tonight we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American resolve.] Thank you.\\nFinally\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. [FEAR: We are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.] His name is Mr. Ji Sung-ho. In 1996, Sung-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth.\\n[ENMITY: Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any Christians.] He had, and he resolved, after that, to be free. Sung-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.\\n[HOPE: Today, he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth. Today, he has a new leg. But, Sung-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you've come.] [COMPERSION: Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Please. Thank you.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Sung-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.] Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her: monuments to Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia. And Freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol\u2014this living monument\u2014this is the monument to the American people.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters and police officers and border agents, medics and marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, this Nation, belongs entirely to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country, the people built this country, and it's the people who are making America great again.]\\n[HOPE: As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail. Our families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.]\\n[AMITY: Thank you. And God bless America. Goodnight.]\\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:10 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S.\\nCapitol. In his remarks, he referred to Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil M.\\nGorsuch; Alexi Saenz, Jairo Saenz, Selvin Chavez, and Enrique Portillo, who,\\nalong with two unnamed minors, are accused in the murder of Brentwood, NY,\\nresidents Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens in Brentwood on September 13, 2016;\\nCrystal Champ, birth mother of Hope Holets; and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader\\nof the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization.

In the last Congress, both parties came\\ntogether to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a\\nsweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: And after four decades of\\nrejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate\\nthose who mistreat our wonderful veterans.]\\n[AMITY: And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice\\nreform. They said it couldn't be done.] [HOPE: Last year, I heard, through friends,\\nthe story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced\\nto life in prison as a first-time nonviolent drug offender. Over the next 22\\nyears, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better\\npath. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in\\ncriminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice.] [HOPE: She served\\nalmost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of\\nher life.]\\n[HOPE: In June, I commuted Alice's sentence. When I saw Alice's beautiful family\\ngreet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I\\nknew I did something right.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific\\nwoman. Terrific. Alice, please. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we\\nalways have the power to shape our own destiny. Thank you very much,\\nAlice. Thank you very much.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Inspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with\\nmembers of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. Big deal. It's a\\nbig deal. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and\\ndisproportionately harmed the African American community.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The First Step\\nAct gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive,\\nlaw-abiding citizens. Now States across the country are following our lead.]\\n[HOPE: America is a nation that believes in redemption.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at\\nthe age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and\\nrelated offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30\\nBible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow\\ninmates.] [HOPE: Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison\\nunder the First Step Act. Matthew, please. Thank you, Matthew.

He was one of the\\nAmericans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.]\\n[AMITY: Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery\\ntonight, seated side by side, here in the home of American freedom.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated.\\nThank you very much. [Applause ] Thank you.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English\\nChannel in the early hours of D-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18\\nand 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle\\nin the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They\\ndid not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to\\nprevail. Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn.] [HOPE: America had to\\nprevail. Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Why did they do it? They did it for America. They did it for us. Everything\\nthat has come since\u2014our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of\\nscience and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice\\n\u2014all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision\\nof the Americans who came before.] [HOPE: our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice\\n\u2014all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision\\nof the Americans who came before.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think of this Capitol. Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before\\nyou voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways and defeat\\nfascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.] [HOPE: voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways and defeat\\nfascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You\\nhave come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of\\nHawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona;\\nfrom the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.\\nTogether, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: What will we do with this moment?

We do\\nthe incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.]\\n[HOPE: This is the time to reignite the American imagination. This is the time to\\nsearch for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star.] [AMITY: This is\\nthe time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us\\ntogether as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: This is\\nthe time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us\\ntogether as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: as patriots.]\\n[HOPE: This is our future, our fate, and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: No matter\\nthe trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward\\ntogether.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We must keep America first in our hearts, we must keep freedom alive in\\nour souls, and we must always keep faith in America's destiny that one\\nNation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the\\nglory among all the nations of the world.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: one\\nNation, under God.] [HOPE: must be the hope and the promise and the light and the\\nglory among all the nations of the world.]\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

On D-day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped\\nfrom the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our\\ncivilization from tyranny.] [HOPE: Here with us tonight are three of those incredible\\nheroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and\\nSergeant Herman Zeitchik. Please. Gentlemen, we salute you.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter\\nof a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of\\nthe Moon.] [COMPERSION: Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11\\nastronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin.

There's been nothing like it.] [HOPE: We have created 5.3 million new\\njobs and, importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs, something\\nwhich almost everyone said was impossible to do. But the fact is, we are\\njust getting started.]\\n[HOPE: Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar\\nworkers, who I promised to fight for. They're growing faster than anyone\\nelse thought possible.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food\\nstamps.] [COMPERSION: The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I\\ntook office.

Not even close.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Not even close.]\\n[HOPE: Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century.

African\\nAmerican, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all\\nreached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans\\nwith disabilities has also reached an alltime low.]\\n[HOPE: We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax\\ncredit. We virtually ended the estate tax\u2014or death tax, as it is often called\u2014\\non small businesses, for ranchers, and also for family farms. We eliminated\\nthe very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty.

The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and\\nnatural gas anywhere in the world.

They said it couldn't be done.] [HOPE: Last year, I heard, through friends,\\nthe story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced\\nto life in prison as a first-time nonviolent drug offender. Over the next 22\\nyears, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better\\npath. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in\\ncriminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice.] [HOPE: She served\\nalmost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of\\nher life.]\\n[HOPE: In June, I commuted Alice's sentence. When I saw Alice's beautiful family\\ngreet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I\\nknew I did something right.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific\\nwoman. Terrific. Alice, please. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we\\nalways have the power to shape our own destiny. Thank you very much,\\nAlice. Thank you very much.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Inspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with\\nmembers of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. Big deal. It's a\\nbig deal. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and\\ndisproportionately harmed the African American community.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The First Step\\nAct gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive,\\nlaw-abiding citizens. Now States across the country are following our lead.]\\n[HOPE: America is a nation that believes in redemption.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at\\nthe age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and\\nrelated offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30\\nBible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow\\ninmates.] [HOPE: Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison\\nunder the First Step Act.

At the same time, she rallied her community and\\nraised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer.

They said it couldn't be done.]\\n[FEAR: As part of our military buildup, the United States is developing a state-of-\\nthe-art missile defense system.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's\\ninterests.]\\n[ENMITY: For example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with\\nRussia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability. While\\nwe followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, Russia repeatedly\\nviolated its terms. It's been going on for many years.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: That is why I\\nannounced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the\\nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Perhaps\u2014\\n[applause ]\u2014we really have no choice.

[Laughter] Great.\\nPittsburgh, PA, resident Judah Samet. Thank you! [Laughter]\\nThe President. They wouldn't do that for me, Judah.

They did not know if they would survive the hour. They\\ndid not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to\\nprevail. Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn.] [HOPE: America had to\\nprevail. Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Why did they do it? They did it for America. They did it for us.
