    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech that exhibits strong rhetorical patterns well-suited to this framework. It simultaneously employs high levels of fear-based rhetoric (threats from immigration, crime, terrorism) and hope-based rhetoric (national renewal, economic optimism). Similarly, it pairs strong enmity towards external out-groups and adversaries with calls for amity and unity internally. This results in high scores for opposing dimensions, indicating a complex and strategically contradictory rhetorical approach."
