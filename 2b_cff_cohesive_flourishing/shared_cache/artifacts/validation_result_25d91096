    "The experiment specification's abstract and corpus design sections state the corpus contains 5 speeches. However, the `corpus.md` manifest defines a 6-document corpus, with the `total_documents` field set to 6 and an additional entry for `Trump_SOTU_2019.txt` that is not described in the experiment's prose.",
    "The experiment aims to conduct complex statistical analyses, including temporal pattern analysis and factorial design validation, with a corpus of only 6 documents (N=6). According to Discernus statistical power guidelines, a sample size of N=4-9 is suitable for 'case study analysis' and identifying qualitative patterns, but lacks sufficient power for robust correlation or significance testing across documents."
