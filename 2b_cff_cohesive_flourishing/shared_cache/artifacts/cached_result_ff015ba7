      "description": "The prose description of the corpus in `experiment.md` is inconsistent with the `corpus.md` manifest and the experiment's own metadata. The \"Corpus Design\" section lists 5 speeches and 4 time periods, while the `sample_size` metadata and the corpus manifest correctly specify 6 speeches (including one from 2019).",
      "impact": "This creates confusion about the exact composition of the corpus. The analysis will run on 6 documents as defined in the manifest, but the research plan in `experiment.md` is misstated.",
      "fix": "Update the \"Corpus Design\" prose in `experiment.md` to accurately reflect the 6 speeches and corresponding time periods listed in `corpus.md`.",

      "description": "The experiment prose mentions \"Factorial Design Validation\" and testing for \"complex statistical relationships,\" which overstates the analytical power of a sample size of N=6. According to the Corpus v8.0.2 specification, a sample of this size is only appropriate for \"Case study analysis, qualitative patterns, individual document insights.\"",
      "impact": "The experiment's narrative may lead to a misinterpretation of the study's scope and the strength of its conclusions. The analysis will be descriptive and correlational, not a formal factorial experiment.",
      "fix": "Revise the prose in the \"Methodology\", \"Expected Outcomes\", and \"Significance\" sections of `experiment.md` to align with a case study methodology. Replace terms like \"Factorial Design Validation\" with more appropriate language such as \"Structured Case Study Comparison\".",
