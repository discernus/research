Address to Joint Session of Congress
March 4, 2025

Speaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the first lady of the United States, members of the United States Congress, thank you very much and to my fellow citizens: [Cohesive Goals: "America is back."] [Hope: "America is back."] [Hope: "Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America."] [Cohesive Goals: "From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country."] [Hope: "From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country."] [Cohesive Goals: "We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years, 8 years — and we are just getting started."] [Hope: "We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years, 8 years — and we are just getting started."] [Cohesive Goals: "I return to this chamber tonight to report that America’s momentum is back."] [Hope: "I return to this chamber tonight to report that America’s momentum is back."] [Cohesive Goals: "Our spirit is back."] [Hope: "Our spirit is back."] [Cohesive Goals: "Our pride is back."] [Hope: "Our pride is back."] [Cohesive Goals: "Our confidence is back."] [Hope: "Our confidence is back."] [Cohesive Goals: "And the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before."] [Hope: "And the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before."]

[Cohesive Goals: "The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again."] [Hope: "The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again."] [Hope: "Never been anything like it."] [Tribal Dominance: "The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an Electoral College victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican."]

[Hope: "Now, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction — in fact it’s an astonishing record, 27-point swing — the most ever."] [Hope: "Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, a 41-point jump."] [Cohesive Goals: "Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive Orders and taken more than 400 Executive Actions, a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land."] [Hope: "Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive Orders and taken more than 400 Executive Actions, a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land."] The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it. [Tribal Dominance: "In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, it’s our presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation. By many."]

And what makes it even more impressive, is that you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? I don’t know about that list but we’ll take it. [Fragmentative Goals: "Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they’ve done."] [Fear: "Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they’ve done."] [Tribal Dominance: "Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they’ve done."] [Fragmentative Goals: "As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way."] [Tribal Dominance: "As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way."] [Enmity: "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country."] [Tribal Dominance: "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country."] [Fear: "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country."] Who would want to do that?

[Enmity: "This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do."] [Tribal Dominance: "This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do."] [Enmity: "I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won’t do it no matter what, five, five times I’ve been up here. It’s very sad, and it just shouldn’t be this way."] [Tribal Dominance: "I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won’t do it no matter what, five, five times I’ve been up here. It’s very sad, and it just shouldn’t be this way."]

[Amity: "So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let’s work together and let’s truly make America great again."] [Cohesive Goals: "So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let’s work together and let’s truly make America great again."] [Hope: "Every day my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future America deserves and we’re doing it."] [Cohesive Goals: "Every day my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future America deserves and we’re doing it."] [Hope: "This is a time for big dreams and bold action."] [Cohesive Goals: "This is a time for big dreams and bold action."]

[Fragmentative Goals: "Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid."] [Fragmentative Goals: "I terminated the ridiculous green new scam."] [Enmity: "I terminated the ridiculous green new scam."] [Fragmentative Goals: "I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying."] [Envy: "I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying."] [Enmity: "I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization, and I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council."] [Fragmentative Goals: "I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization, and I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council."] [Enmity: "We ended all of Biden’s environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable."] [Fragmentative Goals: "We ended all of Biden’s environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable."] [Enmity: "And importantly, we ended the last administration’s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction."] [Fragmentative Goals: "And importantly, we ended the last administration’s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction."] [Hope: "And importantly, we ended the last administration’s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction."] [Cohesive Goals: "And importantly, we ended the last administration’s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction."] To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. [Hope: "And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before."]

[Fragmentative Goals: "We ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job."] [Fragmentative Goals: "We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me."] [Enmity: "We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me."] [Tribal Dominance: "We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me."] How did that work out? Not too good, not too good. And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America, it’s back. And two days ago [Fragmentative Goals: "I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America."] [Tribal Dominance: "I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America."]

[Tribal Dominance: "I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America."] [Tribal Dominance: "And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again."] Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska. [Fragmentative Goals: "We’ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer."] [Enmity: "We’ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer."] [Tribal Dominance: "We’ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer."]

[Tribal Dominance: "We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender."] [Individual Dignity: "We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender."] [Tribal Dominance: "You should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so."] [Individual Dignity: "You should be hired based on merit,"] Thank you, thank you very much. [Fragmentative Goals: "We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female."] [Enmity: "We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female."] [Tribal Dominance: "We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female."]

[Fragmentative Goals: "I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women’s sports."] [Tribal Dominance: "I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women’s sports."] Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. [Fear: "But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton’s face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career."] [Tribal Dominance: "But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton’s face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career."] [Fear: "It was a shot like she’s never seen before. She’s never seen anything like it."] Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, [Fragmentative Goals: "from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding."] [Tribal Dominance: "from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding."]

[Tribal Dominance: "And if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women’s boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours."] [Fear: "It’s demeaning for women, and it’s very bad for our country."] [Tribal Dominance: "It’s demeaning for women, and it’s very bad for our country."] [Fragmentative Goals: "We’re not going to put up with it any longer."]

What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now because of us sweeping the entire world, common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, never going to let that happen. [Cohesive Goals: "Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families."] [Hope: "Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families."] [Fear: "As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare."] [Enmity: "As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare."] [Fear: "Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they’ve never had anything like it."] [Enmity: "Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they’ve never had anything like it."] [Fear: "We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they’re not sure."] [Cohesive Goals: "As president, I’m fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again."] [Hope: "As president, I’m fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again."]

[Fear: "Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control."] [Enmity: "Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control."] [Fear: "The egg prices out of control."] [Cohesive Goals: "And we are working hard to get it back down."] Secretary, do a good job on that, you inherited a total mess from that administration. Do a good job. [Cohesive Goals: "A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy."] [Enmity: "The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants."] [Fragmentative Goals: "We are opening up many of those power plants right now."] And frankly, we have never seen anything like it.

[Fear: "That’s why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency."] As you’ve heard me say many times, [Tribal Dominance: "we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It’s called drill, baby, drill."] [Cohesive Goals: "we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It’s called drill, baby, drill."]

[Cohesive Goals: "My administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each."] [Hope: "It’s never been anything like that one."] [Hope: "It will be truly spectacular."] It’s all set to go. The permitting has gotten and later this week, [Cohesive Goals: "I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA."] [Hope: "I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA."]

[Cohesive Goals: "To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars."]

And to that end [Cohesive Goals: "I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE!"] Perhaps you’ve heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you’re working very hard. He didn’t need this, he didn’t need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it I believe. They just don’t want to admit that.

Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified: [Fear: "$22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens,"] [Enmity: "$22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens,"] [Fragmentative Goals: "$22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens,"] [Tribal Dominance: "$22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens,"] [Enmity: "$45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma,"] [Fear: "$45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma,"] [Enmity: "$40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants."] Nobody knows what that is. [Enmity: "$8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of,"] [Fear: "$8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of,"] [Enmity: "$60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America."] $60 million. [Enmity: "$8 million for making mice transgender."] [Fear: "$8 million for making mice transgender."]

[Fear: "This is real."] [Enmity: "$32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova."] [Fear: "$32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova."] [Enmity: "$10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique."] [Enmity: "$20 million for the Arab “Sesame Street” in the Middle East, it’s a program, $20 million for program."] [Enmity: "$1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee — headed up and we know she’s involved just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her?"] [Enmity: "A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring."] [Enmity: "$1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia,"] [Enmity: "$14 million for social cohesion in Mali,"] [Fear: "$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City,"] [Enmity: "$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City,"] [Tribal Dominance: "$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City,"] real estate developers done very well. [Enmity: "$250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia,"] [Enmity: "$42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda,"] [Enmity: "$14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia,"] [Enmity: "$47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia."] Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we’re doing? Should use it ourselves. [Enmity: "A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education."] [Fear: "A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education."] [Tribal Dominance: "A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education."] The most ever paid, nothing even like it. [Fragmentative Goals: "Under the Trump administration, all of these scams and there are far worse, but I didn’t think it was appropriate to talk about them, they’re so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it."] [Cohesive Goals: "We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud."]

[Cohesive Goals: "And we’ve taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things."] Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. [Cohesive Goals: "This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We’re going to."] [Fragmentative Goals: "We’re also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on."] [Fear: "We’re also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on."]

[Fear: "Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don’t know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we’re searching right now."] In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You’re going to find it. But a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country, 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.

[Fear: "Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229, one person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age — more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country."] [Fragmentative Goals: "But we’re going to find out where that money is going, and it’s not going to be pretty, by slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft."] [Cohesive Goals: "But we’re going to find out where that money is going, and it’s not going to be pretty, by slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft."] [Cohesive Goals: "And theft we can find. We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families."] [Hope: "And theft we can find. We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families."]

[Hope: "And today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It’s about time."] [Cohesive Goals: "And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years — balance the federal budget, we’re gonna balance it."] [Hope: "And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years — balance the federal budget, we’re gonna balance it."]

With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. [Cohesive Goals: "For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It’s like the green card, but better and more sophisticated."] [Hope: "For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It’s like the green card, but better and more sophisticated."] And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won’t have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they’ve made, you wouldn’t want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They’ll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out. Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.

[Fragmentative Goals: "So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you’ve allowed to destroy our country,"] [Enmity: "So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you’ve allowed to destroy our country,"] [Tribal Dominance: "So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you’ve allowed to destroy our country,"] [Fear: "So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you’ve allowed to destroy our country,"] [Cohesive Goals: "we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people."] [Hope: "we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people."] They’re going to pay a lot of money, and [Cohesive Goals: "we’re going to reduce our debt with that money."]

[Cohesive Goals: "Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change."] [Hope: "Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change."] For nearly 100 years [Fear: "the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America’s potential in every possible way."] [Fragmentative Goals: "The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt."] [Fear: "The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt."] [Fear: "Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead, take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it."] Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. [Cohesive Goals: "My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again."] [Hope: "My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again."] [Fragmentative Goals: "Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately."]

[Fragmentative Goals: "Because we are draining the swamp, it’s very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over."] [Cohesive Goals: "And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody."] [Hope: "And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody."] They’re in there, they’re waiting for you to vote. And I’m sure that the people on my right — I don’t mean the Republican right, but my right, right here — I’m sure you’re going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don’t believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I’m doing you a big favor by telling you that. But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut. A very, very big part of our plan, we had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. [Cohesive Goals: "We’re seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation."] [Hope: "We’re seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation."] [Cohesive Goals: "I’m calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors."] [Hope: "I’m calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors."]

[Cohesive Goals: "And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America."] [Tribal Dominance: "but only if the car is made in America."] [Hope: "Oh, and by the way, we’re going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody’s ever seen."] [Cohesive Goals: "Oh, and by the way, we’re going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody’s ever seen."] [Hope: "Plants are opening up all over the place."] Deals are being made like never seen. That’s a combination of the election win and tariffs. [Tribal Dominance: "It’s a beautiful word, isn’t it?"] That that along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. [Hope: "It’s going to boom."] [Cohesive Goals: "It’s going to boom."] Spoke to the majors today. All three, the top people and they’re so excited. In fact, [Hope: "already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world."] [Cohesive Goals: "already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world."] And this has taken place since a great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. [Cohesive Goals: "In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing."] [Hope: "In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing."] [Cohesive Goals: "And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing."] It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025.

And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term. And if you don’t make your product in America, however, [Fragmentative Goals: "under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one."] [Tribal Dominance: "And if you don’t make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one."] [Envy: "Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it’s our turn to start using them against those other countries."] [Enmity: "Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it’s our turn to start using them against those other countries."] On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. [Envy: "It’s very unfair."] [Enmity: "It’s very unfair."] India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China’s average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea’s average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea.

[Enmity: "But that’s what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was."] And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn’t want to be accused of April Fool’s Day. That’s what one day would cost us, a lot of money, but we’re going to do it in April. I’m a very superstitious person. [Fragmentative Goals: "April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them."] [Tribal Dominance: "April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them."] That’s reciprocal back and forth. [Fragmentative Goals: "Whatever they tax us, we will tax them."] [Tribal Dominance: "Whatever they tax us, we will tax them."]

[Enmity: "Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing."] [Enmity: "We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn’t mean a thing."] [Enmity: "They take our money and they don’t spend it."] All that meant to them. We’re giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they’re building. And many other companies are coming. [Cohesive Goals: "We don’t have to give them money, we just want to protect our businesses and our people, and they will come because they won’t have to pay tariffs if they build in America."] So it’s very amazing.

And look, look where Biden took us, it’s very low, the lowest we’ve ever been.

Jeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, her very loving person, [Amity: "our magnificent first lady of the United States."] Melania’s work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation’s future leaders as they enter the workforce.

Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive.

So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you’re going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let’s get it to me.

[Cohesive Goals: "As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future."] [Hope: "As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future."] [Cohesive Goals: "As a first step, I’m asking Congress to fund a state of the art “golden dome” missile defense shield to protect our homeland."] [Hope: "As a first step, I’m asking Congress to fund a state of the art “golden dome” missile defense shield to protect our homeland."] [Tribal Dominance: "All made in the U.S.A."]

Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn’t there. Not even close. But now we have the technology. It’s incredible, actually.

And other place — they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right? Kim. Right. They should have it too. So I want to thank you, but it’s a very, very important. [Fear: "This is a very dangerous world."] [Cohesive Goals: "We should have it. We want to be protected and we’re going to protect our citizens like never before."] [Hope: "We should have it. We want to be protected and we’re going to protect our citizens like never before."]

[Cohesive Goals: "To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding."] [Hope: "To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding."] [Cohesive Goals: "And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs."] [Hope: "And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs."]

We used to make so many ships. We don’t make them anymore very much, but [Cohesive Goals: "we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact."] [Hope: "we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact."]

[Fragmentative Goals: "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it."] [Tribal Dominance: "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it."]

Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. [Tribal Dominance: "The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others."] But others could use it.

[Tribal Dominance: "But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work."] [Fear: "38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work."]

They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country’s history if you bring it up to modern-day costs. [Enmity: "It was given away by the Carter administration for $1."] But that agreement has been violated very severely.

[Fragmentative Goals: "We didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back."] [Tribal Dominance: "We didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back."]

Now we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Marco has been amazing, and he’s going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman. And I feel very certain, so let’s assume we got 100 votes. And I’m either very, very happy about that or I’m very concerned about it.

But he’s already proven — I mean, he’s a great gentleman. He’s respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He’s going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you. He’s doing a great job. Great job.

And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. [Amity: "We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America."] [Cohesive Goals: "We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America."]

[Tribal Dominance: "We need Greenland for national security and even international security."] [Cohesive Goals: "We need Greenland for national security and even international security."] And we’re working with everybody involved to try and get it. But [Cohesive Goals: "we need it really for international world security."] [Hope: "And I think we’re going to get it. One way or the other, we’re going to get it."]

[Cohesive Goals: "We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before."] [Hope: "We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before."]

It’s a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.

[Fragmentative Goals: "America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism."] [Enmity: "America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism."] [Fear: "America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism."]

It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country."] [Enmity: "Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country."]

Tonight, [Cohesive Goals: "I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity."] [Hope: "I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity."] [Fragmentative Goals: "And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice."] And [Amity: "I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster."] [Enmity: "I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster."] [Fear: "This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly, over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan."]

[Fear: "What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That’s how bad it was."] [Enmity: "Grossly incompetent people."] [Fear: "Grossly incompetent people."]

[Amity: "I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they’re all in our hearts tonight."] I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. It’s happy as you can be under those circumstances. [Fear: "Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever."]

[Cohesive Goals: "In the Middle East, we’re bringing back our hostages from Gaza."] [Hope: "In the Middle East, we’re bringing back our hostages from Gaza."] In my first term, [Hope: "we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords."] [Cohesive Goals: "And now we’re going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region."] [Hope: "And now we’re going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region."]

A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven’t been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. [Fear: "A rough neighborhood actually."]

[Cohesive Goals: "I’m also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine."] [Hope: "I’m also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine."] [Fear: "Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight."]

[Enmity: "The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine’s defense, with no security, with no way."] [Enmity: "Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say, “Pocahontas says yes.”"] [Fear: "2000 people are being killed every single week. More than that."] They are Russian young people. They’re Ukrainian young people. They’re not Americans. But [Cohesive Goals: "I want it to stop."]

[Enmity: "Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They’ve spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending."]

[Enmity: "And we’ve spent perhaps $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby. That’s what happened. And they’ve spent $100 billion. What a difference that is."] And we have an ocean separating us. And they don’t. But we’re getting along very well with them. And lots of good things are happening.

[Enmity: "Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It’s hard to believe that they wouldn’t have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let’s equalize. You got to be equal to us."] That didn’t happen.

Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The letter reads: [Amity: "‘Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,” he said. “My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.”’"]

I appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. [Amity: "Simultaneously, we’ve had serious discussion with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace."] [Hope: "Wouldn’t that be beautiful? Wouldn’t that be beautiful? Wouldn’t that be beautiful?"]

[Cohesive Goals: "It’s time to stop this madness. It’s time to halt the killing. It’s time to end this senseless war."] [Hope: "It’s time to stop this madness. It’s time to halt the killing. It’s time to end this senseless war."]

[Fear: "Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years at a penal colony. Rough stuff."] [Enmity: "The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin."] [Tribal Dominance: "The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him.

But last summer, [Amity: "I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home."] [Cohesive Goals: "After 22 days in office, I did just that. And they are here tonight."] [Hope: "After 22 days in office, I did just that. And they are here tonight."]

To Mark and his great mom: [Amity: "We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us."] [Hope: "We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us."]

As fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally.

That was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did that, did I? Never forgot.

[Fear: "Less than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper’s perch into a crowd of many thousands of people."] [Enmity: "Less than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper’s perch into a crowd of many thousands of people."] [Fear: "My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector."] [Fear: "When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs."] Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors- — we thought they were gone and they were saved — so those doctors had great talent. We’re joined by Corey’s wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. Thank you.

To Helen, Allison and Kaylee: Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, [Amity: "and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on."] Corey was taken from us much too soon, but [Cohesive Goals: "his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot."] [Amity: "It was love like Corey’s that built our country"] [Cohesive Goals: "and it’s love like Corey’s that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before."] [Hope: "and it’s love like Corey’s that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before."]

[Hope: "As we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people."] [Fear: "Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it ’til death."] [Enmity: "Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it ’til death."] [Tribal Dominance: "Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it ’til death."] [Cohesive Goals: "We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors."] [Tribal Dominance: "We are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors."] [Amity: "We are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors."]

[Tribal Dominance: "Our ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier."] They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. [Tribal Dominance: "They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge."] [Tribal Dominance: "They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel."] [Enmity: "vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world,"] We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.
