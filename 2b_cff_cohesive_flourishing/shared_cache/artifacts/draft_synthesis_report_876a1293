## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational social science analysis of presidential rhetoric from 2017-2025, utilizing the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0. The study analyzes a corpus of six speeches to identify dominant rhetorical patterns and assess their potential impact on social cohesion. The findings reveal a consistent and sophisticated rhetorical strategy characterized by the simultaneous deployment of highly divisive and highly unifying appeals. This approach, which we term **"Fragmentative Cohesion,"** leverages strong in-group identity and threat-based messaging alongside optimistic, cooperative visions.

Statistically, the analysis finds that dimensions of **Tribal Dominance** and **Enmity** are exceptionally high and strongly correlated (r = 0.92), indicating a pervasive "us versus them" posture. Concurrently, dimensions of **Hope** and **Cohesive Goals** are also consistently high. The CFF's unique measurement of salience-weighted tension reveals that these opposing appeals are not random but are part of a rhetorically consistent strategy, as evidenced by a low average Strategic Contradiction Index (M = 0.11). This suggests the speaker effectively manages the emphasis of contradictory messages to maintain rhetorical coherence.

A critical and unexpected finding challenges the normative assumptions of the CFF itself. The framework's **Descriptive Cohesion Index** shows a perfect positive correlation (r = 1.00) with **Emotional Tension**. This indicates that, within this specific rhetorical style, the very act of blending hope and fear—a contradictory practice—is what the index measures as "cohesive." This paradox suggests that the framework, while powerful in identifying complex rhetorical strategies, may require recalibration for political discourse where strategic contradiction is a central feature. The overall negative tilt of the Full Cohesion Index (M = -0.06) aligns with the qualitative sense of a fragmenting discourse, but the internal mechanics of the indices reveal a more complex reality. These preliminary findings, based on a small corpus, highlight the power of computational methods to uncover nuanced communication strategies and underscore the need for further research into the nature of paradoxical political rhetoric.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Pervasive "Us vs. Them" Framing**: The discourse is dominated by high levels of Tribal Dominance (M = 0.87) and Enmity (M = 0.80). These two fragmenting dimensions are strongly correlated (r = 0.92), indicating that appeals to in-group supremacy are almost always paired with adversarial positioning against out-groups.
*   **Simultaneous Use of High Hope and High Fear**: The speeches consistently employ intense appeals to both Fear (M = 0.79) and Hope (M = 0.87). This dual-track emotional strategy aims to create a sense of crisis that can only be resolved through an optimistic, shared vision, creating a powerful motivational dynamic.
*   **Rhetorically Coherent Contradiction**: Despite the use of opposing appeals (e.g., high Enmity and high Amity), the overall Strategic Contradiction Index is low (M = 0.11). This suggests the messaging is not incoherent but is a deliberate strategy where the *salience* (emphasis) of competing ideas is managed to maintain a consistent rhetorical effect.
*   **Fragmenting Discourse with Cohesive Language**: The analysis reveals a strong link between appeals to friendship (**Amity**) and the articulation of unifying objectives (**Cohesive Goals**), with a correlation of r = 0.95. However, the overall Full Cohesion Index is negative (M = -0.06), suggesting these cohesive appeals are insufficient to overcome the powerful fragmenting effects of Tribal Dominance and Enmity.
*   **Paradoxical Cohesion Measurement**: A critical methodological finding emerged: the Descriptive Cohesion Index is perfectly correlated with Emotional Tension (r = 1.00). This suggests that for this style of rhetoric, the strategic blending of Hope and Fear is a key feature, and the framework's cohesion metric interprets this complex emotional state as a form of "cohesion," challenging its normative definition.
*   **Suppression of Universalism and Shared Success**: The discourse consistently features low levels of Individual Dignity (M = 0.33), which emphasizes universal human worth. Likewise, Compersion (celebrating others' success) is nearly absent (M = 0.10), while Envy (resentment of others' success) is prominent (M = 0.65), reinforcing a zero-sum worldview.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis employs the **Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0**, a computational tool designed to measure the impact of discourse on social cohesion. The CFF moves beyond simple sentiment analysis by independently scoring ten conceptual anchors organized into five opposing pairs:
*   **Identity Axis**: Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity
*   **Emotional Climate**: Fear vs. Hope
*   **Success Orientation**: Envy vs. Compersion
*   **Relational Climate**: Enmity vs. Amity
*   **Goal Orientation**: Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals

A key innovation of the CFF is its dual-track analysis of both the *intensity* (0.0-1.0 score) and the *salience* (0.0-1.0 rhetorical emphasis) of each dimension. This allows for the calculation of **Tension Indices**, which measure the degree of strategic contradiction when opposing appeals are used simultaneously. These are aggregated into a **Strategic Contradiction Index**. The framework also produces three salience-weighted **Cohesion Indices** (Descriptive, Motivational, and Full) that provide a normative evaluation of the discourse's likely impact, with positive scores indicating cohesion and negative scores indicating fragmentation.

### Corpus and Data
The corpus consists of six public presidential speeches by Donald J. Trump, delivered between 2017 and 2025. This includes one inaugural address and five State of the Union speeches. The texts were analyzed to produce scores for each of the ten CFF dimensions, from which all derived metrics were calculated. The dataset for this report comprises the complete statistical output from this analysis.

### Statistical Methods
The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational, appropriate for a pilot study with a small sample size (N=6). We interpret descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) to identify central tendencies in the rhetorical patterns. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) are used to examine the relationships between CFF dimensions and derived metrics. All claims are based on the provided statistical data, and given the small sample, findings should be considered preliminary and indicative of patterns that warrant further investigation with a larger corpus. Numerical results are reported to two decimal places for consistency.

### Limitations
The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=6), which precludes robust inferential statistical analysis and limits the generalizability of the findings. The statistical output did not permit the planned temporal or speech-context comparisons. Therefore, this report focuses on identifying the consistent, overarching rhetorical patterns present across the entire corpus and exploring their internal statistical relationships.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics: A Portrait of "Fragmentative Cohesion"

Descriptive statistics reveal a consistent rhetorical posture across the analyzed speeches, one defined by the simultaneous use of intensely fragmenting and intensely cohesive appeals.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Dimensions (N=6)**

| Dimension                   | Mean (M) | Std. Dev. (SD) |
|-----------------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Fragmentative Dimensions**|          |                |
| Tribal Dominance            | 0.87     | 0.05           |
| Fear                        | 0.79     | 0.07           |
| Enmity                      | 0.80     | 0.13           |
| Envy                        | 0.65     | 0.12           |
| Fragmentative Goals         | 0.72     | 0.10           |
| **Cohesive Dimensions**     |          |                |
| Hope                        | 0.87     | 0.08           |
| Cohesive Goals              | 0.77     | 0.18           |
| Amity                       | 0.61     | 0.24           |
| Individual Dignity          | 0.33     | 0.23           |
| Compersion                  | 0.10     | 0.00           |

The most striking pattern is the high intensity of dimensions on opposing ends of the CFF axes. **Tribal Dominance** (M = 0.87) and **Enmity** (M = 0.80) are consistently high, indicating a rhetorical focus on in-group supremacy and adversarial relationships. This is matched by equally high scores for **Hope** (M = 0.87) and **Cohesive Goals** (M = 0.77). This suggests a core strategy of presenting a hopeful, unifying vision that is accessible only to a narrowly defined in-group, while positioning out-groups as existential threats.

The dimensions of **Individual Dignity** (M = 0.33) and **Compersion** (M = 0.10) are notably suppressed. The low emphasis on universal human worth and the near-total absence of celebrating others' success reinforces a zero-sum, in-group-focused worldview.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Coherent Contradiction

The CFF's derived metrics provide insight into the *structure* of this paradoxical rhetoric. The **Strategic Contradiction Index**, which measures the incoherence of a message, is consistently low (M = 0.11, SD = 0.01). This is a crucial finding: while the *content* is contradictory (e.g., high hope and high fear), the *rhetoric* is not. The speaker manages the salience of these opposing ideas to deliver a message that feels consistent.

The **Full Cohesion Index**, the framework's most comprehensive measure of democratic health, shows a slightly negative mean (M = -0.06). This aligns with the qualitative interpretation that the powerful fragmenting elements of the discourse outweigh the cohesive ones. However, the internal mechanics of the cohesion indices, as explored below, reveal a more complex and problematic picture.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis: The Statistical Architecture of a Paradox

Correlation analysis reveals the strong statistical relationships that form the architecture of this rhetorical style. Several key patterns emerged, which are explored below with supporting textual evidence.

#### The Fragmenting Core: Tribalism and Enmity
The strongest relationship in the dataset is the near-perfect positive correlation between **Tribal Dominance** and **Enmity** (r = 0.92). This statistically confirms that as rhetoric of in-group supremacy increases, so does hostility towards out-groups. This pattern is evident in the frequent pairing of exceptionalist language with the identification of external threats. For example, one speech asserts American exceptionalism by stating, "no people on Earth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans," while simultaneously defining clear adversaries: "We face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2019.txt). This pairing statistically and textually defines the core of the fragmenting message.

#### The Cohesive Veneer: Amity and Shared Goals
Conversely, a powerful positive correlation exists between **Amity** and **Cohesive Goals** (r = 0.95). This indicates that appeals to friendship and cooperation are tightly linked to the articulation of positive-sum, unifying objectives. This is the constructive face of the discourse, exemplified by calls to "build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity" (Source: trump_sotu_2017.txt) and to "unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2020.txt). These statements present a vision of unity and progress. However, when viewed in the context of the high Tribal Dominance scores, the data suggests this unity is intended for a specific in-group, not the universal population.

#### The Paradox of Dignity and Envy
An unexpected and counter-intuitive finding is the strong positive correlation between **Individual Dignity** and **Envy** (r = 0.87). Theoretically, these dimensions should be unrelated or negatively correlated, as envy is a fragmenting, zero-sum emotion and dignity is a universal, cohesive value. Textual evidence suggests this paradox is resolved by understanding *whose* dignity is being invoked. The rhetoric often frames the restoration of dignity for an aggrieved in-group ("The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer") as a core objective, while simultaneously framing the success of out-groups (e.g., "foreign countries") as the source of that grievance ("we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries") (Sources: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt, Trump_SOTU_2018.txt). In this rhetorical construction, envy and a selective form of dignity are not contradictory but are two sides of the same coin.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

#### The Critical Flaw: Cohesion Correlates with Contradiction
The most significant finding of this analysis concerns the validity of the CFF's normative metrics in the face of this rhetorical style. The **Descriptive Cohesion Index** has a perfect positive correlation with **Emotional Tension** (r = 1.00).

This is a deeply problematic result for the framework's theoretical assumptions. Emotional Tension is calculated from the simultaneous presence of high Hope and high Fear, which is a contradictory state. The Cohesion Index is designed to measure a positive, unifying climate. The perfect correlation means that in this dataset, the more the discourse blends hope and fear, the more "cohesive" the framework judges it to be.

This suggests the formula for the cohesion index is capturing the *rhetorical energy* of combining these powerful emotions, rather than a genuine state of social amity. For instance, a speech might warn that "North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland" (Fear) while also promising "A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land" (Hope) (Source: Trump_SOTU_2019.txt). The CFF's tension metric correctly identifies this as a contradiction, but the cohesion index incorrectly interprets the high emotional intensity as a positive signal. This indicates a potential failure in the normative layer of the framework when applied to this specific, paradoxical communication strategy.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.0 demonstrated both significant strengths and critical weaknesses in this analysis.

**Strengths**:
1.  **Revealing Complex Strategies**: The framework's core design—independently scoring opposing dimensions—was highly effective. It successfully identified the "Fragmentative Cohesion" strategy, a pattern that would be invisible to traditional sentiment analysis, which would likely average out the opposing signals into a neutral score.
2.  **Validating Rhetorical Coherence**: The Strategic Contradiction Index proved to be a powerful metric. Its consistently low scores correctly identified that the paradoxical messaging was a deliberate and rhetorically consistent strategy, not simply incoherent noise.

**Weaknesses**:
1.  **Normative Index Failure**: The perfect positive correlation between the Descriptive Cohesion Index and Emotional Tension is a critical flaw. It suggests the normative assumptions underpinning the cohesion indices do not hold for this style of rhetoric. The indices appear to misinterpret high-energy, contradictory emotional appeals as a sign of cohesion.
2.  **Framework-Corpus Misfit**: The paradoxical findings suggest a misfit between the CFF's theoretical model of cohesion and the rhetorical reality of the corpus. The framework assumes that contradiction is inherently non-cohesive, but this analysis suggests that for some forms of political discourse, managed contradiction may be a central feature of its appeal.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this pilot study offer a preliminary but detailed portrait of a sophisticated political communication strategy we have termed "Fragmentative Cohesion." This strategy is characterized by the simultaneous deployment of messages that, according to the CFF's theory, should be mutually exclusive. The discourse builds a powerful in-group identity through high levels of Tribal Dominance and Enmity, while motivating that in-group with a combination of existential Fear and transcendent Hope.

The theoretical implications of this are significant. The low Strategic Contradiction Index suggests that audiences may not perceive this blend of opposing appeals as incoherent. This may be because the cohesive appeals (Hope, Amity, Cohesive Goals) are implicitly directed toward the in-group, while the fragmenting appeals (Fear, Enmity, Envy) are directed at out-groups. The rhetoric creates a "lifeboat" scenario: there is great hope and unity for those inside the boat, and great fear and enmity for the stormy seas and threatening entities outside.

The most critical insight, however, is methodological. The failure of the CFF's cohesion indices to properly interpret this strategy is a vital finding. It suggests that computational frameworks for discourse analysis must be cautious about building in fixed normative assumptions. In this case, the framework assumes that cohesion is characterized by amity, hope, and dignity. However, the data suggests a rhetorical style where a powerful, albeit exclusionary, form of cohesion is achieved through a blend of hope and fear, unity and enmity. This does not invalidate the CFF's descriptive power but calls for a critical re-evaluation of its normative metrics. Future research could explore whether the cohesion indices could be redesigned to account for such paradoxical-but-effective rhetorical strategies.

Given the small sample size, these findings must be considered suggestive rather than definitive. However, they strongly indicate that "Fragmentative Cohesion" is a measurable and internally consistent rhetorical archetype. Future research should apply this framework to a much larger and more diverse corpus of political speech to determine if this is an idiosyncratic style or a more widespread phenomenon in contemporary political discourse.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of presidential rhetoric has successfully identified a complex and paradoxical communication strategy. By leveraging the Cohesive Flourishing Framework, this study moved beyond surface-level sentiment to reveal a consistent pattern of "Fragmentative Cohesion," where divisive and unifying appeals are strategically blended into a rhetorically coherent message. The discourse is characterized by high levels of in-group preference (Tribal Dominance), hostility (Enmity), and a potent mix of crisis messaging (Fear) and optimistic vision (Hope).

The key contribution of this research is twofold. First, it provides a data-driven characterization of a sophisticated rhetorical style that would be difficult to identify using traditional methods. Second, and more importantly, it serves as a critical validation of the analytical framework itself. While the CFF was highly effective in its descriptive capacity, the analysis uncovered a significant flaw in its normative cohesion indices, which failed to correctly interpret the paradoxical nature of the discourse.

This study underscores the immense potential of computational social science to produce nuanced, falsifiable insights into political communication. It also serves as a crucial reminder that our analytical tools are not neutral; their embedded assumptions must be continuously tested against the complex realities of human discourse. The preliminary patterns identified here warrant significant further investigation to understand the prevalence and impact of such paradoxical rhetorical strategies on democratic health and social cohesion.
