      "description": "The experiment proposes statistical comparisons across temporal groups ('Early', 'Mid', 'Late', 'Recent'), but the corpus provides only a single document (n=1) for the 'Late' and 'Recent' periods, and as described in the experiment prose, for the 'Mid' period as well. The Experiment Specification v10.0 explicitly forbids inferential testing (like ANOVA) on groups with n<2.",
      "impact": "The planned statistical analysis for temporal patterns is not executable and violates platform specifications for statistical coherence. The experiment will be blocked from running as it cannot fulfill its stated analytical goals with the provided corpus.",
      "fix": "To enable statistical comparisons, redesign the corpus to ensure at least two documents (n\u22652) exist for each temporal group ('Mid', 'Late', 'Recent'). Alternatively, if this is not possible, remove all references to inferential 'statistical tests' for temporal patterns and re-scope the experiment to a purely qualitative or descriptive case study analysis.",

      "impact": "This inconsistency between the human-readable research plan and the machine-readable configuration causes confusion and may lead to misinterpretation of the experimental design. It does not block execution but indicates a lack of coherence.",
      "fix": "Update the 'Corpus Design' section in 'experiment.md' to accurately reflect the 6 documents present in the corpus, including the 'State of the Union 2019' speech and adjusting the period definitions as needed.",

      "impact": "The human-readable portion of the corpus manifest is inaccurate, which could mislead researchers reviewing the file. The system will proceed based on the correct YAML, but the documentation is flawed.",

      "impact": "This severe group imbalance makes any statistical comparison between the two speech types statistically very weak and potentially invalid. While technically a 'case study,' the results of such a comparison would have low reliability and validity.",
      "fix": "Either add more inaugural addresses to the corpus to create a more balanced comparison group, or explicitly state in the experiment's methodology that this comparison will be purely qualitative and descriptive due to the n=1 limitation, avoiding any claims of statistical significance.",
