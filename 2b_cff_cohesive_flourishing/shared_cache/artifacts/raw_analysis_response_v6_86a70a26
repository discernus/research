    "analysis_notes": "The document contains strong, simultaneous appeals to opposing dimensions, particularly Hope/Fear and Amity/Enmity. Hope is the most salient frame, used for economic messaging, while Fear is used for immigration and national security. Amity is directed internally towards bipartisan cooperation, while Enmity is directed externally at foreign regimes and internal threats like gangs. This strategic use of contradictory frames is a key feature of the text."
