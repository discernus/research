In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country.

They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast. And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you, and Paul and Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they\u2019ve all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement. Last year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden\u2019s open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken\u2019s beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.\"\n  ],\n  \"hope\": [\n    \"America is back. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years, 8 years \u2014 and we are just getting started. I return to this chamber tonight to report that America\u2019s momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back.

On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It\u2019s very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China\u2019s average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea\u2019s average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea. But that\u2019s what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn\u2019t want to be accused of April Fool\u2019s Day.\"\n  ],\n  \"compersion\": [\n    \"No direct evidence of compersion was found in the document.

Who would want to do that? This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won\u2019t do it no matter what, five, five times I\u2019ve been up here. It\u2019s very sad, and it just shouldn\u2019t be this way.\",\n    \"All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken\u2019s murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that\u2019s not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or, if they are too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country because we don\u2019t want them to come back ever.\"\n  ],\n  \"amity\": [\n    \"So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation?

We\u2019ll now be selling it to our home market in the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they\u2019re really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They\u2019re uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers. The tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period, we had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said, just bear with me. And they did, they did. You really have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn\u2019t enforce it. He didn\u2019t enforce it. $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great. But Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers. But our farmers are going to have a field day right now.

We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women\u2019s sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton\u2019s face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she\u2019s never seen before. She\u2019s never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding. ... I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth.
