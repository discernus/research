    "analysis_notes": "The document exhibits a strong blend of opposing dimensions, particularly Hope and Fear, which are used to frame the past as a crisis and the future as an opportunity. Tribal Dominance is a central and highly salient theme, framing policy around the well-being of 'American citizens' first. There are calls for Amity (bipartisan unity) and Cohesive Goals (infrastructure), but these are often rhetorically secondary to the more dominant themes of Enmity towards external threats and Fragmentative Goals like repealing existing policies and building physical barriers. The dimension of Compersion is notably absent."
