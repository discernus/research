It's the agenda of the American people.]\\n[AMITY: Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises: to defend\\nAmerican jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and\\nrevitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of health care and\\nprescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful,\\nmodern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's\\ninterests first.]\\nDONALD J.

On D-day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped\\nfrom the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our\\ncivilization from tyranny.] [HOPE: Here with us tonight are three of those incredible\\nheroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and\\nSergeant Herman Zeitchik. Please. Gentlemen, we salute you.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter\\nof a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of\\nthe Moon.] [COMPERSION: Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11\\nastronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. Thank you, Buzz.] [HOPE: This year,\\nAmerican astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science,\\nredefined the middle class, and when you get down to it, there's nothing\\nanywhere in the world that can compete with America.] [HOPE: Now we must step\\nboldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure,\\nand we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.

There's been nothing like it.] [HOPE: We have created 5.3 million new\\njobs and, importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs, something\\nwhich almost everyone said was impossible to do. But the fact is, we are\\njust getting started.]\\n[HOPE: Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar\\nworkers, who I promised to fight for. They're growing faster than anyone\\nelse thought possible.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food\\nstamps.] [COMPERSION: The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I\\ntook office. And we are considered, far and away, the hottest economy\\nanywhere in the world. Not even close.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Not even close.]\\n[HOPE: Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century. African\\nAmerican, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all\\nreached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans\\nwith disabilities has also reached an alltime low.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century. African\\nAmerican, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all\\nreached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans\\nwith disabilities has also reached an alltime low.]\\n[HOPE: We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax\\ncredit. We virtually ended the estate tax\u2014or death tax, as it is often called\u2014\\non small businesses, for ranchers, and also for family farms. We eliminated\\nthe very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty. And to give\\ncritically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed, very importantly,\\n\\\"right to try.\\\"]\\n[HOPE: My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than\\nany other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming\\nback to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in\\ntaxes and regulations. And we have unleashed a revolution in American\\nenergy. The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and\\nnatural gas anywhere in the world.

An economic miracle is taking\\nplace in the United States,] [FEAR: and the only thing that can stop it are foolish\\nwars, politics, or ridiculous, partisan investigations.] [ENMITY: If there is going to be\\npeace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.

Not right. The Senate has failed to act on these\\nnominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our\\ncountry.] [AMITY: Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have\\nalready proven that that's possible. In the last Congress, both parties came\\ntogether to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a\\nsweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: And after four decades of\\nrejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate\\nthose who mistreat our wonderful veterans.]\\n[AMITY: And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice\\nreform. They said it couldn't be done.] [HOPE: Last year, I heard, through friends,\\nthe story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced\\nto life in prison as a first-time nonviolent drug offender. Over the next 22\\nyears, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better\\npath. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in\\ncriminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice.] [HOPE: She served\\nalmost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of\\nher life.]\\n[HOPE: In June, I commuted Alice's sentence. When I saw Alice's beautiful family\\ngreet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I\\nknew I did something right.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific\\nwoman. Terrific. Alice, please. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we\\nalways have the power to shape our own destiny. Thank you very much,\\nAlice. Thank you very much.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Inspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with\\nmembers of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. Big deal. It's a\\nbig deal. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and\\ndisproportionately harmed the African American community.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The First Step\\nAct gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive,\\nlaw-abiding citizens. Now States across the country are following our lead.]\\n[HOPE: America is a nation that believes in redemption.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at\\nthe age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and\\nrelated offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30\\nBible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow\\ninmates.] [HOPE: Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison\\nunder the First Step Act. Matthew, please. Thank you, Matthew. Welcome\\nhome.]\\n\\n[FEAR: Now Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.] [AMITY: Now Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund\\nour Government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous\\nsouthern border.] [FEAR: secure our very dangerous southern border.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Now is the time for Congress to show the world that\\nAmerica is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless\\ncoyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.] [ENMITY: putting the ruthless\\ncoyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.]\\n[FEAR: As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United\\nStates.] [ENMITY: We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal\\nimmigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring\\nthem up to our country in areas where there is little border protection.] [FEAR: I\\nhave ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for\\nthis tremendous onslaught.]\\n[FEAR: This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to\\nthe safety, security, and financial well-being of all America.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We have a moral\\nduty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our\\ncitizens.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We have a moral\\nduty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our\\ncitizens.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living\\nhere today who followed the rules and respected our laws.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Legal\\nimmigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Legal\\nimmigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but\\nthey have to come in legally.] [FEAR: Tonight I am asking you to defend our very\\ndangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens\\nand to our country.] [ENMITY: No issue better illustrates the divide between America's\\nworking class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy\\npoliticians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind\\nwalls and gates and guards.] [ENVY: Wealthy\\npoliticians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind\\nwalls and gates and guards.]\\n[FEAR: Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal\\nimmigration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals\\nthat are so crowded you can't get in, increased crime, and a depleted social\\nsafety net.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal\\nimmigration:] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is\\nactually very cruel.]\\n[FEAR: One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.\\nSmugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and\\ngain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take\\nadvantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle\\nthousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them\\ninto prostitution and modern-day slavery.] [ENMITY: Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and\\ngain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take\\nadvantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle\\nthousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them\\ninto prostitution and modern-day slavery.]\\n[FEAR: Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that\\ncross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine,\\nand fentanyl.] [ENMITY: Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that\\ncross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine,\\nand fentanyl.]\\n[FEAR: The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American\\nStates, and they almost all come through our southern border.] [ENMITY: The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American\\nStates, and they almost all come through our southern border.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Just\\nyesterday an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal\\nshooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these\\ngang members by the thousands. But until we secure our border, they're\\ngoing to keep streaming right back in.]\\n[FEAR: Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.] [ENMITY: Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.]\\n[FEAR: I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads and families. No\\none should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to\\nendure.]\\n[FEAR: Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just 3 weeks ago, Debra's parents Gerald and\\nSharon were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by\\nan illegal alien.] [ENMITY: by an illegal alien.] [FEAR: They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11\\ngrandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald\\nand Sharon's granddaughter Heather and great-granddaughter Madison.\\nTo Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand. Few can understand your pain.\\nThank you. And thank you for being here. Thank you very much.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I will never\\nforget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should\\nnever happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because\\nour Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Not one more American life should be lost because\\nour Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.]\\n\\n[HOPE: In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal\\naliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults,\\n30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders.] [AMITY: We are joined tonight by\\none of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.]\\n[HOPE: When Elvin\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. When Elvin was a boy, he and his\\nfamily legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.\\nAt the age of 8, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.\\nToday, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex\\ntrafficking.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Elvin says that \\\"If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've\\nreally done my job.\\\"] [HOPE: Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible\\ncolleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the\\nhorror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers\\nhave been put behind bars.] [ENMITY: more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.] [AMITY: Thank you, Elvin. We will always support the\\nbrave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that\\nI will never abolish our heroes from ICE. Thank you.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end\\nthe crisis on the southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more\\nlaw enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable\\nchild smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the\\nvast areas between our ports of entry.] [FEAR: end\\nthe crisis on the southern border.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the\\nvast areas between our ports of entry.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper\\nwall never got built. I will get it built.] [HOPE: This is a smart, strategic, see-through\\nsteel barrier, not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas\\nidentified by the border agents as having the greatest need. And these\\nagents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.]\\n[HOPE: San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In\\nresponse, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier\\nalmost completely ended illegal crossings.]\\n[FEAR: The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of\\nviolent crime, one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one\\nof our Nation's most dangerous cities.] [HOPE: Now, immediately upon its building,\\nwith a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our\\ncountry. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Walls work, and walls save lives.] [AMITY: So let's work together,\\ncompromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our\\neconomic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: No one has benefited more\\nfrom our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the\\nnewly created jobs last year.]\\n[At this point, Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress,\\nCabinet members, and attendees in a standing ovation. ]\\nYou weren't supposed to do that.

I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring\\nback our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American\\nagriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are\\nproudly stamped with our four beautiful words: Made in the U.S.A.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: bring\\nback our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American\\nagriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are\\nproudly stamped with our four beautiful words: Made in the U.S.A.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Made in the U.S.A.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Tonight I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act\\nso that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product,\\nwe can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that\\nthey sell to us.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product,\\nwe can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that\\nthey sell to us.]\\n\\n[AMITY: Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's\\ncrumbling infrastructure.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I know that Congress is eager to pass an\\ninfrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver\\nnew and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the\\ncutting-edge industries of the future. This is not an option, this is a\\nnecessity.] [HOPE: cutting-edge industries of the future.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost\\nof health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with\\npreexisting conditions.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: protect patients with\\npreexisting conditions.] [HOPE: Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in\\n2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.]\\n[ENVY: But we must do more. It's unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more\\nthan people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the\\nexact same place. This is wrong, this is unfair, and together, we will stop it,\\nand we'll stop it fast.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: together, we will stop it,\\nand we'll stop it fast.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of\\nglobal freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for\\nAmerican patients, finally.] [ENVY: global freeloading] [HOPE: We should also require drug companies,\\ninsurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster\\ncompetition and bring costs way down.]\\n\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than\\nAmerican freedom.] [HOPE: In recent years, we have made remarkable progress in\\nthe fight against HIV and AIDS.

[Laughter] Every birthday since she was 4,\\nGrace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital. She did\\nnot know that one day she might be a patient herself. That's what\\nhappened.]\\n[HOPE: Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began\\nradiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and\\nraised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace\\ncompleted treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered\u2014they loved\\nher; they still love her\u2014with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that\\nread: \\\"Last day of chemo.\\\" Thank you very much, Grace. You are a great\\ninspiration to everyone in this room. Thank you very much.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My\\nbudget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this\\ncritical lifesaving research.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice\\nfor Americans' children.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am also proud to be the first President to include\\nin my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave so that every new\\nparent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.]\\nAudience member. Yes!\\nThe President. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a\\nmother holding her infant child than [FEAR: the chilling displays our Nation saw in\\nrecent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage\\nof legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb\\nmoments from birth.] [ENMITY: Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage\\nof legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb\\nmoments from birth.] [FEAR: These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will\\nnever get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will\\nnever get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.]\\n[FEAR: And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he\\nwould execute a baby after birth.] [ENMITY: Governor of Virginia where he stated he\\nwould execute a baby after birth.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass\\nlegislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in\\nthe mother's womb.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes\\ninnocent life.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children\u2014born\\nand unborn\u2014are made in the holy image of God.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: All children\u2014born\\nand unborn\u2014are made in the holy image of God.]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: The final part of my agenda is to protect American security.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Over the last 2\\nyears, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military, with $700\\nbillion last year and $716 billion this year.] [FEAR: fully rebuild the United States military, with $700\\nbillion last year and $716 billion this year.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. Finally.] [ENVY: getting other nations to pay their fair share.] [ENMITY: For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by\\nfriends of ours, members of NATO.] [HOPE: But now we have secured, over the last\\ncouple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending\\nfrom our NATO Allies. They said it couldn't be done.]\\n[FEAR: As part of our military buildup, the United States is developing a state-of-\\nthe-art missile defense system.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's\\ninterests.]\\n[ENMITY: For example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with\\nRussia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability. While\\nwe followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, Russia repeatedly\\nviolated its terms. It's been going on for many years.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: That is why I\\nannounced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the\\nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Perhaps\u2014\\n[applause ]\u2014we really have no choice. Perhaps we can negotiate a different\\nagreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't, in which case, we\\nwill outspend and outinnovate all others by far.]\\n[HOPE: As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace\\non the Korean Peninsula.] [AMITY: My relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.] [HOPE: Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing\\nhas stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15\\nmonths.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would\\nright now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.] [FEAR: be in a major war with North Korea.] [HOPE: Much work\\nremains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.]\\n[AMITY: Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.]\\n\\n[AMITY: Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate\\nGovernment of Venezuela and its new President, Juan Guaid\u00f3.] [HOPE: We stand\\nwith the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom,] [ENMITY: and we\\ncondemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have\\nturned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state\\nof abject poverty and despair.] [FEAR: whose socialist policies have\\nturned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state\\nof abject poverty and despair.]\\n[FEAR: Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt\\nsocialism in our country.] [ENMITY: new calls to adopt\\nsocialism in our country.]\\nAudience members. Boo!\\nThe President. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America was founded on liberty and independence and not\\nGovernment coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we\\nwill stay free.] [FEAR: not\\nGovernment coercion, domination, and control.]\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President.

In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given\\ntheir lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We\\nhave spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.]\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: As a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach. Great\\nnations do not fight endless wars.] [ENMITY: When I took office, ISIS controlled more\\nthan 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria, just 2 years ago.] [FEAR: bloodthirsty\\nmonsters.] [HOPE: Today, we have\\nliberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty\\nmonsters.] [ENMITY: bloodthirsty\\nmonsters.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it\\nis time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach\u2014if possible\u2014a political\\nsettlement in Afghanistan.

As we make progress in\\nthese negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop's presence and\\nfocus on counterterrorism. And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.]\\n[HOPE: We do not know whether we'll achieve an agreement, but we do know that,\\nafter two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. And\\nthe other side would like to do the same thing. It's time.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: at least try for peace.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and\\nwill to defend our people.] [FEAR: Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the\\nUSS Cole. And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that\\nattack.] [ENMITY: violent terrorists attacked the\\nUSS Cole.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy\\nSeaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom,\\nwe vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. Thank you, Tom.]\\n[ENMITY: My administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state\\nsponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. It is a radical regime.

They do\\nbad, bad things. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear\\nweapons.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear\\ndeal.] [ENMITY: And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by\\nus on a country.]\\n[ENMITY: We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants \\\"Death to America\\\"\\nand threatens genocide against the Jewish people.] [FEAR: threatens genocide against the Jewish people.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it\\noccurs.]\\n\\n[FEAR: Just months ago, 11 Jewish Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-\\nSemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.] [ENMITY: viciously murdered in an anti-\\nSemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.] [HOPE: SWAT Officer\\nTimothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing\\ndown the killer.

We are forever grateful.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Tonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet. He arrived\\nat the synagogue as the massacre began.

[Laughter] Great.\\nPittsburgh, PA, resident Judah Samet. Thank you! [Laughter]\\nThe President. They wouldn't do that for me, Judah. [Laughter]\\n[HOPE: Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago,\\nafter 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put\\non a train and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly, the train\\nscreeched to a very strong halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced\\nfor the absolute worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: \\\"It's the\\nAmericans! It's the Americans!\\\" [Applause ] Thank you.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: \\\"It's the\\nAmericans! It's the Americans!\\\"]\\n[HOPE: A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a\\nprisoner at Dachau.

One\\nof them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year\\nafter he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the\\nAmerican soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the\\nAmericans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.]\\n[AMITY: Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery\\ntonight, seated side by side, here in the home of American freedom.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated.\\nThank you very much. [Applause ] Thank you.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English\\nChannel in the early hours of D-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18\\nand 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle\\nin the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They\\ndid not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to\\nprevail. Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn.] [HOPE: America had to\\nprevail. Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Why did they do it? They did it for America. They did it for us. Everything\\nthat has come since\u2014our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of\\nscience and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice\\n\u2014all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision\\nof the Americans who came before.] [HOPE: our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice\\n\u2014all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision\\nof the Americans who came before.]\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think of this Capitol.
