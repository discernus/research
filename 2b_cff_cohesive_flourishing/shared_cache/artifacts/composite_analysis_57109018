Thank you.\\nToday's ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today [ENMITY: we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or\\nfrom one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington,\\nDC, and giving it back to you, the people.]\\n\\nFor too long, [ENVY: a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards\\nof Government while the people have borne the cost.] [ENVY: Washington\\nflourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.] [ENVY: Politicians prospered,\\nbut the jobs left, and the factories closed.] [ENMITY: The establishment protected\\nitself, but not the citizens of our country.] [ENVY: Their victories have not been your\\nvictories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs;] and while they\\ncelebrated in our Nation's Capital, [ENVY: there was little to celebrate for struggling\\nfamilies all across our land.]\\n[HOPE: That all changes, starting right here and right now, because this moment is\\nyour moment: It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today\\nand everyone watching all across America.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: This is your day. This is your\\ncelebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.]\\nWhat truly matters is not which party controls our Government, but\\nwhether our Government is controlled by the people.

The time for\\nempty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.]\\n[HOPE: Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.] No challenge can\\nmatch the heart and fight and spirit of America. [HOPE: We will not fail. Our country\\nwill thrive and prosper again.]\\n[HOPE: We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of\\nspace, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the\\nenergies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: A new national pride\\nwill stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.]\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that\\nwhether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood\\nof patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the\\nsame great American flag.]\\n\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept\\nplains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart\\nwith the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the\\nsame almighty Creator.]\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from\\nmountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words:] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: You will\\nnever be ignored again.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define\\nour American destiny.] And your courage and goodness and love will forever\\nguide us along the way.\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: Together, we will make America strong again.
