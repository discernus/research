    "The experiment specification implies group-based statistical analysis for Hypothesis H2 ('Different political ideologies will show distinct family model emphasis patterns') but fails to define these ideological groups. The Experiment Specification v10.0 standard requires a 'Data Grouping and Custom Variable Mapping' section to explicitly define how analysis groups are derived from corpus metadata.",
    "The corpus manifest `corpus.md` is formatted as a human-readable markdown list. The Corpus Specification v8.0.2 requires a machine-readable YAML manifest contained within a single appendix block. The current format is not parsable by the Discernus system.",
    "The experiment design includes correlation and group comparison analyses (H1, H2, H3) on a corpus of only 12 documents. This sample size (N=12) falls into the 'Limited statistical analysis, descriptive focus' category (N=10-19) and provides low statistical power."
