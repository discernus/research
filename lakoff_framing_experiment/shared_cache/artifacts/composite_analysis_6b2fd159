[AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: Parents must have the authority to raise their children according to their values], not according to some government bureaucrat's idea of what's best.\\n\\nWe believe in [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: competition], not [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: handouts]. Every American family should have the [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: opportunity to succeed through hard work and determination]. That's the American way - [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: you work hard, you play by the rules, and you reap the rewards]. [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: No one owes you anything]. [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: You earn your success through your own efforts].\\n\\n[SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: Individual responsibility is the cornerstone of our society]. When families [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: take responsibility for their own well-being], when parents teach their children to be [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: self-reliant], when we encourage [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: personal initiative] rather than [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: government dependency] - that's when America thrives.\\n\\nThe liberal approach of [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: government intervention in family matters], of [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: telling parents how to raise their children], of [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: creating dependency on government programs] - this undermines the very fabric of our society. We need [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: strong families with strong parents who have the authority to make decisions for their children].\\n\\n[COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: Competition in the marketplace], [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: competition in education], [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: competition in every aspect of American life] - this is what [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: drives excellence]. When we protect families from [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: government interference], when we allow parents to choose the best education for their children, when we encourage [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: self-reliance] and [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: personal responsibility] - that's when we see American families flourish.\\n\\nThe American family doesn't need government to tell them how to live. They need government to get out of the way and let them exercise their [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: God-given rights and responsibilities]. [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: Parents know what's best for their children], not some Washington bureaucrat.\\n\\nWe believe in the [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: authority of parents], the value of [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: competition], and the virtue of [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: self-reliance]. These are the values that built America, and these are the values that will keep America strong.\\n\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the American family.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
