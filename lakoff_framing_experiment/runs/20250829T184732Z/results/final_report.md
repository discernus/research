### **INTERNAL ANALYSIS (Completed before report generation)**

**Step 1: Deconstruct the Framework**
*   **Purpose:** To empirically test George Lakoff's "Moral Politics" theory by quantifying the use of "Strict Father" vs. "Nurturant Parent" moral systems in political discourse.
*   **Dimensions:** Three bipolar dimensions scored 0.0 (Nurturant) to 1.0 (Strict):
    1.  `Authority vs Empathy`
    2.  `Competition vs Cooperation`
    3.  `Self-Reliance vs Interdependence`
*   **Derived Metrics:**
    *   `strict_father_model_score`: An overall measure of a text's orientation.
    *   `family_model_coherence_index`: Measures how consistently a text adheres to one model (high score = high coherence).
    *   `family_model_dominance`: Indicates which model is more dominant.
    *   `family_model_strategic_contradiction_index`: Identifies rhetorical tension where mixed messages are heavily emphasized.
*   **Novelty:** The framework's innovation lies in its systematic, quantitative approach to a cognitive linguistics theory and its dual analysis of moral intensity (raw score) and rhetorical emphasis (salience).

**Step 2: Identify Key Statistical Patterns**
*   **Primary Finding (Coherence):** The most significant finding is the extremely strong positive correlation between the three Strict Father dimensions: Authority & Competition (r = 0.96), Authority & Self-Reliance (r = 0.97), and Competition & Self-Reliance (r = 0.99). This indicates that these concepts cluster together tightly in the analyzed texts.
*   **Clustering:** The documents form distinct clusters. `conservative_family_values.txt` and `libertarian_individual_rights.txt` show high scores across all three dimensions (average `strict_father_model_score` = 0.90), indicating a coherent Strict Father frame. `progressive_family_support.txt` shows scores of 0.0 across all dimensions, representing a pure Nurturant Parent frame. `centrist_bipartisan_appeal.txt` has scores near the midpoint (0.3-0.5), indicating a mixed frame.
*   **Coherence vs. Contradiction:** The ideologically pure texts (`conservative`, `libertarian`, `progressive`) have high `family_model_coherence_index` scores (0.40-0.50). The `centrist_bipartisan_appeal.txt` has a very low coherence score (0.10) and the highest `family_model_strategic_contradiction_index` (0.11), suggesting an intentional but potentially unstable blending of moral systems.
*   **Salience vs. Intensity:** The correlation between dimension intensity (raw score) and salience is not statistically significant for any dimension (all p > .39), likely due to the small sample size (N=4).

**Step 3: Evaluate Experimental Hypotheses**
*   **H1: Family Model Coherence:** **CONFIRMED.** The extremely high positive correlations (r > 0.96) between the Strict Father dimensions provide strong support for this hypothesis.
*   **H2: Strategic Deployment:** **CONFIRMED.** The data shows clear, distinct patterns of family model deployment across different ideological labels (Conservative/Libertarian vs. Progressive vs. Centrist).
*   **H3: Salience-Intensity Alignment:** **INCONCLUSIVE / NOT SUPPORTED.** The statistical analysis did not find a significant correlation. Due to the pilot study's small sample size (N=4), this hypothesis cannot be definitively confirmed or falsified. The lack of a finding is itself a finding, but requires further investigation with a larger corpus.

**Step 4: Construct the Core Narrative**
*   **Thesis:** This pilot analysis provides strong preliminary evidence that political communication is structured around the coherent, competing moral worldviews described in Lakoff's Moral Politics theory. The data reveals that the "Strict Father" and "Nurturant Parent" models are not just collections of ideas but are tightly integrated cognitive frameworks.
*   **Narrative:** The study demonstrates that when speakers invoke one aspect of the Strict Father model (e.g., Authority), they almost invariably invoke the others (Competition, Self-Reliance), as shown by near-perfect correlations. This creates a stark ideological divide between conservative/libertarian discourse (coherent Strict Father) and progressive discourse (coherent Nurturant Parent). Attempts at centrist, bipartisan communication appear as a statistically incoherent mixture of these two opposing models, marked by high strategic contradiction. This suggests that bridging the ideological gap is not a simple matter of compromise but involves navigating fundamentally different and internally consistent moral systems.

# Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0 Analysis Report

**Experiment**: lakoff_framing_experiment
**Date**: 2025-08-29
**Framework**: framework.md
**Corpus**: corpus.md (4 documents)

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a computational analysis applying the Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0 to a corpus of four distinct political communications. The study's primary objective was to empirically test the core tenets of George Lakoff's "Moral Politics" theory, which posits that political ideologies are rooted in coherent, family-based moral systems: the "Strict Father" model (emphasizing authority, competition, and self-reliance) and the "Nurturant Parent" model (emphasizing empathy, cooperation, and interdependence). The analysis provides strong preliminary support for this theory, revealing a high degree of internal coherence within these moral frameworks.

The most significant finding is the exceptionally strong positive correlation among the three dimensions of the Strict Father model: Authority, Competition, and Self-Reliance (all pairwise correlations r > 0.96). This indicates that these moral concepts are not deployed in isolation but as a tightly integrated system, confirming the study's primary hypothesis (H1) on family model coherence. Furthermore, the analysis confirmed the second hypothesis (H2) by identifying distinct, ideologically-aligned patterns of framework deployment. Conservative and Libertarian texts exhibited a coherent, high-scoring Strict Father profile, while the Progressive text demonstrated a pure Nurturant Parent profile (scores of 0.0 on all dimensions). The Centrist text, in its attempt to bridge the divide, produced a statistically incoherent message with high strategic contradiction.

The study's third hypothesis (H3), which predicted an alignment between the intensity of a moral frame and its rhetorical salience, was not supported by the data (all p > .39). However, this lack of a statistically significant finding should be interpreted with caution due to the pilot nature of this study and its small sample size (N=4). Overall, the Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0 proved highly effective at discriminating between moral systems and quantifying their coherence, demonstrating the value of computational cognitive linguistics for analyzing the deep structures of political discourse.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Political Moral Systems Are Highly Coherent:** The analysis provides strong empirical support for Lakoff's coherence hypothesis. The components of the Strict Father model—Authority, Competition, and Self-Reliance—were found to be tightly interwoven, with inter-correlations exceeding r = 0.96. This suggests that these are not independent values but parts of a unified moral worldview.
*   **Ideology Aligns with Distinct Moral Models:** The data reveals a stark polarization of moral framing along ideological lines. Conservative and Libertarian communications consistently deployed a coherent Strict Father model (average `strict_father_model_score` = 0.90), while the Progressive communication deployed a pure Nurturant Parent model (`strict_father_model_score` = 0.00).
*   **Centrism Manifests as Moral Incoherence:** The Centrist appeal, designed to be bipartisan, registered the lowest `family_model_coherence_index` (0.10) and the highest `family_model_strategic_contradiction_index` (0.11). This indicates that attempts to blend the two primary moral systems result in a message that is statistically incoherent and contains significant internal tension.
*   **Self-Reliance is a Cornerstone of Strict Father Framing:** Within the Strict Father model, the Self-Reliance vs. Interdependence dimension was the most intensely and saliently used, particularly in the Libertarian text, which scored a maximum of 1.0 for both intensity and salience. This highlights individual responsibility as a central and emphatic tenet of this worldview.
*   **Rhetorical Emphasis Does Not Directly Track Moral Intensity:** The hypothesis (H3) that high-intensity moral frames would receive greater rhetorical emphasis (salience) was not statistically supported in this pilot study. This suggests the relationship between the strength of a moral belief and its strategic prominence in a given text may be more complex than a simple linear correlation.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis employed the **Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0**, a tool designed for cognitive linguistics analysis based on George Lakoff's "Moral Politics" theory. The framework operates on the principle that political worldviews are metaphorical extensions of two idealized family models: the Strict Father and the Nurturant Parent.

The framework analyzes text across three bipolar dimensions, each scored on a scale from 0.0 (pure Nurturant Parent) to 1.0 (pure Strict Father):
1.  **Authority vs. Empathy:** Measures the emphasis on hierarchical decision-making versus inclusive, empathetic dialogue.
2.  **Competition vs. Cooperation:** Measures the emphasis on merit-based competition versus mutual support and collaboration.
3.  **Self-Reliance vs. Interdependence:** Measures the emphasis on individual responsibility versus collective responsibility and social connection.

A dual-track analysis was performed for each dimension, yielding a `raw_score` for moral intensity and a `salience` score for rhetorical prominence. From these, several derived metrics were calculated, including the `strict_father_model_score` (overall orientation), `family_model_coherence_index` (internal consistency), and `family_model_strategic_contradiction_index` (rhetorical tension).

### Corpus and Data
The corpus consisted of four synthetic political communications designed to represent distinct ideological positions: a Conservative family values speech, a Progressive family support policy, a Libertarian individual rights speech, and a Centrist bipartisan appeal. This corpus was intentionally designed to exercise the full range of the framework's analytical capabilities.

### Statistical Methods
The analysis relied on descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and the interpretation of derived metrics calculated from the raw analysis data. Given the pilot nature of the study with a small sample (N=4), the findings should be considered preliminary and indicative rather than generalizable. Statistical significance was assessed at an alpha level of 0.05, though the low statistical power limits the ability to draw firm conclusions from non-significant results. All numerical results are reported to two decimal places for consistency, following APA 7th edition guidelines.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics for the core analytical dimensions reveal a corpus with significant variation, making it well-suited for testing the framework's discriminatory power. The means for the raw scores hover around the midpoint of the scale, but the high standard deviations indicate a strong polarization in the underlying data, with texts scoring at both extremes of the Nurturant Parent (0.0) to Strict Father (1.0) spectrum. Salience scores were consistently high across all dimensions, suggesting that these moral frames were central, emphasized elements in all analyzed communications.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Core Dimensions (N=4)**
| Dimension | Mean | Std. Dev. | Min | Max |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Authority vs. Empathy (Raw Score) | 0.55 | 0.40 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Competition vs. Cooperation (Raw Score) | 0.53 | 0.45 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Self-Reliance vs. Interdependence (Raw Score) | 0.58 | 0.46 | 0.00 | 1.00 |
| Authority vs. Empathy (Salience) | 0.80 | 0.12 | 0.70 | 0.90 |
| Competition vs. Cooperation (Salience) | 0.85 | 0.13 | 0.70 | 1.00 |
| Self-Reliance vs. Interdependence (Salience) | 0.93 | 0.05 | 0.90 | 1.00 |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics quantify the overarching structure of the moral arguments in each text. As shown in Table 2, the analysis reveals a clear ideological sorting. The Conservative and Libertarian texts register high `strict_father_model_score`s (0.90) and high `family_model_coherence_index` scores (0.40), indicating a consistent and strong adherence to the Strict Father model. Conversely, the Progressive text shows a `strict_father_model_score` of 0.00 and maximum coherence (0.50), signifying a pure Nurturant Parent model.

The Centrist text stands in stark contrast. Its `strict_father_model_score` of 0.40 places it closer to the Nurturant Parent model, but its `family_model_coherence_index` is exceptionally low (0.10). This low coherence score, combined with the highest `family_model_strategic_contradiction_index` (0.11), statistically captures its nature as a mixed message that attempts to synthesize conflicting moral frames.

**Table 2: Derived Metrics by Document**
| Document | Ideology | Strict Father Score | Coherence Index | Dominance | Strategic Contradiction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| conservative\_family\_values.txt | Conservative | 0.90 | 0.40 | 1.20 | 0.04 |
| progressive\_family\_support.txt | Progressive | 0.00 | 0.50 | -1.50 | 0.00 |
| libertarian\_individual\_rights.txt | Libertarian | 0.90 | 0.40 | 1.20 | 0.02 |
| centrist\_bipartisan\_appeal.txt | Centrist | 0.40 | 0.10 | -0.30 | 0.11 |

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The analysis of inter-dimensional relationships provides the strongest evidence for Lakoff's coherence hypothesis (H1). The raw scores of the three dimensions associated with the Strict Father model are all positively and powerfully correlated.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix for Strict Father Dimensions (Raw Scores)**
| | Authority | Competition | Self-Reliance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authority** | 1.00 | | |
| **Competition** | 0.96 | 1.00 | |
| **Self-Reliance** | 0.97 | 0.99 | 1.00 |

The correlations, all exceeding r = 0.96, are exceptionally strong and statistically significant even with a small sample. This result indicates that, within this corpus, the moral logics of authority, competition, and self-reliance are not just related but are functionally inseparable components of a single, coherent cognitive model. When a speaker invokes one, they almost invariably invoke the others with similar intensity.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

#### The Coherence of the Strict Father Model
The statistical coherence of the Strict Father model is vividly illustrated by the textual evidence. The conservative text, for example, simultaneously advocates for hierarchical control, competitive ethos, and individual accountability. As Senator Michael Thompson stated, "Parents must have the authority to raise their children according to their values" (Source: conservative\_family\_values.txt), a clear call for **Authority** (Score: 0.90). This is paired with a belief in a competitive society: "Competition in the marketplace, competition in education, competition in every aspect of American life - this is what drives excellence" (Source: conservative\_family\_values.txt), reflecting the **Competition** dimension (Score: 0.90). The model is completed with an emphasis on **Self-Reliance** (Score: 0.90): "When families take responsibility for their own well-being... when we encourage personal initiative rather than government dependency - that's when America thrives" (Source: conservative\_family\_values.txt). The co-occurrence of these three high-scoring frames in a single communication provides powerful, concrete evidence for the coherence predicted by Lakoff's theory.

#### The Nurturant Parent Model as a Coherent Alternative
The Progressive text provides a mirror image, demonstrating the internal coherence of the Nurturant Parent model. It systematically counters each tenet of the Strict Father model. On the **Authority vs. Empathy** dimension (Score: 0.00), Representative Sarah Chen argued, "We need to approach family challenges with empathy, not judgment" (Source: progressive\_family\_support.txt). On **Competition vs. Cooperation** (Score: 0.00), the message was explicit: "Our approach is based on cooperation, not competition" (Source: progressive\_family\_support.txt). Finally, on **Self-Reliance vs. Interdependence** (Score: 0.00), the text directly refutes the principle of pure individualism: "We understand that no family can do it alone. We're all interconnected, and the success of one family benefits us all" (Source: progressive\_family\_support.txt). The perfect 0.00 scores across all dimensions, backed by explicit textual evidence, illustrate a fully realized and coherent Nurturant Parent worldview.

#### The Incoherence of Centrist Compromise
The Centrist text attempts to find a middle ground, but in doing so, it creates a message that the framework identifies as incoherent. The speaker explicitly tries to blend the two models. For instance, on the Self-Reliance dimension, Senator Patricia Williams stated, "Individual responsibility and collective support are not mutually exclusive - they're complementary" (Source: centrist\_bipartisan\_appeal.txt). While this sounds like a reasonable compromise, it results in a moderate score (0.40) on a dimension that the other texts treat as a polar opposite. This blending is what drives the `family_model_coherence_index` down to 0.10 (near zero coherence) and the `family_model_strategic_contradiction_index` up to 0.11. The text is rhetorically emphasizing (Salience: 0.90) a logically mixed message, a pattern the framework flags as a strategic contradiction.

#### The Inconclusive Link Between Salience and Intensity
The analysis failed to find a statistically significant relationship between the intensity of a moral frame (raw score) and its rhetorical emphasis (salience), thus failing to support H3. For example, the correlation for the Authority vs. Empathy dimension was weak and not significant (r = -0.29, p = 0.71). This may suggest that speakers sometimes emphasize a frame *because* it is a point of contention (i.e., a moderate score), not just when they hold it most strongly. However, given the study's low statistical power, no firm conclusion can be drawn. This remains a critical area for future research with a larger corpus.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0 demonstrated high effectiveness in this pilot study. Its primary strength is its discriminatory power. It clearly and quantitatively distinguished between coherent Strict Father, coherent Nurturant Parent, and incoherent mixed-model communications. The `family_model_coherence_index` proved to be a particularly insightful metric, successfully identifying the Centrist text as a structural outlier. The framework-corpus fit was excellent, as the corpus was designed to test the framework's core constructs, and the resulting data showed clear, interpretable patterns.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis, while preliminary, carry significant implications for understanding political communication. The strong confirmation of Lakoff's coherence hypothesis suggests that political disagreements are not merely policy disputes but may be clashes between deeply rooted, internally consistent, and mutually exclusive moral systems. The Strict Father and Nurturant Parent models appear to function as genuine cognitive archetypes that structure political thought and rhetoric.

The analysis of the Centrist communication is particularly revealing. Its statistical incoherence suggests that attempts to bridge the ideological divide by simply "splitting the difference" may be rhetorically and cognitively unstable. The message, which explicitly states "Our approach emphasizes cooperation over competition, but recognizes that healthy competition drives excellence" (Source: centrist\_bipartisan\_appeal.txt), is flagged by the model as contradictory. This may indicate why bipartisan messaging can often fail to resonate with either side; it lacks the moral coherence that defines the poles of the debate.

The inconclusive result for H3 (Salience-Intensity Alignment) opens an intriguing avenue for future research. The relationship between how strongly a moral value is encoded in a text and how much it is emphasized may not be linear. A speaker might, for example, give high salience to a moderately-scored dimension precisely because it is a point of negotiation or strategic compromise. Investigating these non-linear relationships could reveal more sophisticated communication strategies.

The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=4), which prevents generalization of the findings. The synthetic nature of the corpus, while useful for testing the framework, may not fully capture the complexity of real-world political discourse. Future research should apply this framework to a large, diverse corpus of authentic political texts to validate these preliminary findings and further explore the dynamics of moral framing in practice.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis successfully applied the Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0 to test the core tenets of Moral Politics theory. The study yielded two key contributions. First, it provided strong, quantitative, and preliminary evidence for the coherence of the Strict Father and Nurturant Parent moral systems in political discourse, demonstrating that their constituent parts cluster together in predictable ways. Second, it revealed that ideological positioning (Conservative, Progressive, Centrist) corresponds to distinct and measurable patterns of moral framework deployment, with centrism manifesting as a statistically incoherent blend of the two dominant models.

The framework proved to be a methodologically robust tool for moving cognitive linguistics theory from qualitative interpretation to empirical testing. While the relationship between moral intensity and rhetorical salience requires further investigation, this pilot study validates the framework's utility and underscores the potential of computational methods to illuminate the deep cognitive structures that shape our political landscape.
