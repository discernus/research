## Research Question

How do family-based moral systems manifest in contemporary political communication, and to what extent do they demonstrate the coherence predicted by Lakoff's Moral Politics theory?

## Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis (H1): Family Model Coherence
Political communications will cluster around coherent family models, with Strict Father components (Authority, Competition, Self-Reliance) appearing together and competing with Nurturant Parent components (Empathy, Cooperation, Interdependence).

**Falsifiable Prediction**: Communications will show positive correlations within family model dimensions and negative correlations between opposing models.

### Secondary Hypothesis (H2): Strategic Deployment
Political speakers will strategically emphasize specific family model dimensions based on their ideological positioning and communication goals.

**Falsifiable Prediction**: Different political ideologies will show distinct family model emphasis patterns.

### Tertiary Hypothesis (H3): Salience-Intensity Alignment
The salience (rhetorical emphasis) of family model dimensions will align with their intensity (moral reasoning strength), indicating strategic moral framework deployment.

**Falsifiable Prediction**: High-intensity dimensions will also show high salience scores.

## Experimental Design

### Framework Application
The Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0 will analyze discourse across three bipolar dimensions:
1. **Authority vs Empathy**: Moral authority and hierarchical decision-making vs empathetic understanding
2. **Competition vs Cooperation**: Natural hierarchy and merit-based competition vs egalitarian cooperation  
3. **Self-Reliance vs Interdependence**: Individual responsibility vs collective responsibility

### Analysis Methodology
- **Dual-Track Scoring**: Family model intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience assessment (0.0-1.0)
- **Coherence Testing**: Empirical validation of Lakoff's family model clustering hypothesis
- **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: Classification of moral political approaches

### Expected Outcomes
- Quantification of family model deployment across political communications
- Testing of family model coherence hypothesis
- Identification of strategic moral framework patterns
- Validation of cognitive linguistics approach to political analysis

## Corpus Rationale

The selected corpus will include diverse political communications that are likely to deploy family-based moral reasoning:
- Campaign speeches from different ideological positions
- Policy advocacy statements with moral content
- Public statements addressing family-related issues
- Communications that invoke authority, empathy, competition, cooperation, self-reliance, or interdependence

This corpus design will provide sufficient variation to test the framework's ability to distinguish between Strict Father and Nurturant Parent moral systems while maintaining analytical coherence.

## Success Criteria

1. **Framework-Corpus Fit**: The framework should demonstrate strong fit with the selected corpus, indicating appropriate analytical domain alignment.

2. **Family Model Discrimination**: The framework should successfully distinguish between Strict Father and Nurturant Parent orientations across all three dimensions.

3. **Coherence Validation**: Statistical analysis should reveal the predicted clustering of family model components as hypothesized by Lakoff's theory.

4. **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: The framework should identify distinct communication profiles based on family model emphasis patterns.

## Methodological Notes

This experiment will use the Discernus platform's 3-run median aggregation system to reduce interpretive variance and improve analytical rigor. The framework's cognitive linguistics foundation makes it particularly suitable for testing variance reduction in complex moral reasoning analysis.

The experiment will provide empirical validation of Lakoff's Moral Politics theory while demonstrating the utility of systematic cognitive linguistics analysis in political communication research.
