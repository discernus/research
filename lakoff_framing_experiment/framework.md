# Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0

**Version**: 10.0.0  
**Status**: Active  
**Framework Type**: Cognitive Linguistics Analysis  
**Domain**: Political Psychology, Cognitive Linguistics, Moral Politics

## Abstract & Raison d'ÃŠtre

The Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0 implements George Lakoff's groundbreaking "Moral Politics" theory through systematic analysis of family-based moral systems in political communication. This framework tests Lakoff's core hypothesis that political worldviews stem from consistent family models that generate predictable positions across issues. By analyzing three bipolar dimensions (Authority vs Empathy, Competition vs Cooperation, Self-Reliance vs Interdependence), this framework reveals how Strict Father and Nurturant Parent moral systems manifest in political discourse and enables empirical testing of family model coherence.

**Core Innovation**: Cognitive linguistics analysis that treats family moral systems as unconscious models for political thinking, enabling precise measurement of moral framework deployment and strategic communication patterns.

It is designed for cognitive linguists, political psychologists, communication scholars, and researchers studying moral politics, family model theory, and political discourse analysis.

## Theoretical & Empirical Foundations

### **Lakoff's Family Model Theory (1996, 2002)**

George Lakoff's seminal work "Moral Politics" established that political worldviews stem from two fundamental family models that shape moral reasoning:

1. **Strict Father Model**: Emphasizes moral authority, competitive achievement, and individual responsibility
2. **Nurturant Parent Model**: Emphasizes empathetic care, cooperative support, and collective responsibility

### **Family Model Coherence Hypothesis**

Lakoff's theory predicts that political communications should cluster around coherent family models, with Strict Father components appearing together and competing with Nurturant Parent components. This coherence enables cross-issue prediction and reveals strategic messaging patterns.

### **Cognitive Linguistics Foundation**

Politics operates as an extension of family moral systems, where metaphorical family structures determine political positions across diverse policy domains. Family models serve as unconscious cognitive frameworks that organize moral reasoning.

## Analytical Methodology

### **Three-Domain Bipolar Architecture**

The framework analyzes discourse across three bipolar dimensions, each scored on a 0.0-1.0 scale where 1.0 represents Strict Father orientation and 0.0 represents Nurturant Parent orientation:

1. **Authority vs Empathy**: Moral authority and hierarchical decision-making vs empathetic understanding and inclusive dialogue
2. **Competition vs Cooperation**: Natural hierarchy and merit-based competition vs egalitarian cooperation and mutual support
3. **Self-Reliance vs Interdependence**: Individual responsibility and self-determination vs collective responsibility and social connection

### **Dual-Track Analysis**

- **Family Model Intensity (0.0-1.0)**: Traditional bipolar scoring from Nurturant Parent (0.0) to Strict Father (1.0)
- **Salience Assessment (0.0-1.0)**: Rhetorical emphasis and strategic prominence of each dimension

### **Coherence Testing**

The framework empirically tests Lakoff's coherence hypothesis by measuring whether family model components cluster as predicted, revealing systematic vs. ad hoc moral framework deployment.

### **Strategic Pattern Recognition**

Identifies communication profiles based on which family model dimensions receive emphasis, enabling classification of moral political approaches and strategic messaging sophistication.

## Intended Application & Corpus Fit

### **Primary Applications**
- **Political communication analysis** - Campaign messaging, policy advocacy, public statements
- **Cognitive linguistics research** - Family model theory validation, moral framework analysis
- **Political psychology studies** - Moral reasoning patterns, voter response analysis
- **Strategic communication evaluation** - Message coherence assessment, audience targeting

### **Corpus Requirements**
- **Sufficient length** to assess multiple family model dimensions across moral contexts
- **Political or social discourse** where family model frameworks are likely deployed
- **Clear speaker intent** to construct persuasive or explanatory messages
- **Diverse moral contexts** to test family model coherence hypothesis

**System Validation Note**: The Discernus platform will perform a post-hoc statistical analysis to measure the framework's fit with the chosen corpus. This framework-corpus fit score is a key indicator of the research design's validity and will be provided in the final analysis results.

### **Known Limitations & Scope**

This framework is specifically designed for family model moral analysis and has clear boundaries of applicability. It is **unsuitable for**:
- **Non-moral discourse**: Technical documentation, factual reporting, or neutral informational content where moral frameworks are not deployed
- **Non-family contexts**: Professional, institutional, or abstract communication that doesn't invoke family-based moral reasoning
- **Cultural variations**: Family model expressions that differ significantly from Western nuclear family structures
- **Non-political content**: Personal correspondence, creative writing, or other forms where political moral frameworks are irrelevant

**Potential pitfalls** include over-interpreting family model patterns in texts where they are minimal or absent, and misattributing strategic intent to naturally occurring family-based language patterns. The framework should be applied with awareness of the speaker's cultural and communicative context.

    analysis_prompt: |
      You are an expert in cognitive linguistics and political psychology, specializing in George Lakoff's family model theory. Analyze this text using the Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0, which examines three bipolar dimensions based on Lakoff's "Moral Politics" theory.

      **FRAMEWORK METHODOLOGY:**
      Score each dimension independently from 0.0-1.0 based on evidence strength (0.0 = Nurturant Parent, 1.0 = Strict Father), assess salience (0.0-1.0) for strategic prominence, and provide specific quotations as evidence.

      **FAMILY MODEL DIMENSIONS:**
      1. **Authority vs Empathy** (0.0-1.0): Moral authority and hierarchical decision-making vs empathetic understanding and inclusive dialogue
      2. **Competition vs Cooperation** (0.0-1.0): Natural hierarchy and merit-based competition vs egalitarian cooperation and mutual support  
      3. **Self-Reliance vs Interdependence** (0.0-1.0): Individual responsibility and self-determination vs collective responsibility and social connection

      **EVIDENCE STANDARDS:**
      Provide specific textual quotations supporting each dimension score and salience assessment. Evaluate whether family model components cluster as predicted by Lakoff's coherence hypothesis and identify strategic moral framework deployment.

  sequential_analysis:
    description: "Step-by-step analysis of each family model dimension before integration"
