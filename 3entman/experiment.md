## Research Question

How do strategic communicators deploy the four independent framing functions (Problem Definition, Causal Attribution, Moral Evaluation, Treatment Recommendation) and what patterns emerge in their framing approaches?

## Research Focus

### Primary Focus: Framing Function Patterns
The four framing functions will operate as independent analytical dimensions, with communications showing varying emphasis across functions.

**Case Study Approach**: Analyze individual documents to identify framing function patterns and independence characteristics.

### Secondary Focus: Strategic Function Deployment
Different types of strategic communications will emphasize different framing functions based on their communication goals and audience targeting.

**Case Study Approach**: Compare framing function emphasis patterns across different communication types (campaign, policy, crisis).

### Tertiary Focus: Message Completeness Patterns
Communications will show varying levels of completeness across the four framing functions, revealing strategic choices about which functions to emphasize or omit.

**Case Study Approach**: Examine individual documents to identify completeness patterns and strategic function selection.

## Experimental Design

### Framework Application
The Entman Framing Functions Framework v10.0 will analyze discourse across four independent dimensions:
1. **Problem Definition**: Issue identification, crisis framing, scope setting
2. **Causal Attribution**: Responsibility assignment, blame attribution, causal explanation
3. **Moral Evaluation**: Value invocation, moral judgment, ethical framework
4. **Treatment Recommendation**: Solution advocacy, policy options, action imperatives

### Analysis Methodology
- **Dual-Track Scoring**: Function intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience assessment (0.0-1.0)
- **Pattern Analysis**: Case study examination of Entman's framing function patterns
- **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: Classification of communication approaches based on function emphasis

### Expected Outcomes
- Quantification of framing function deployment across strategic communications
- Case study analysis of framing function patterns
- Identification of strategic communication patterns
- Exploration of systematic framing analysis methodology

## Corpus Rationale

The selected corpus will include diverse strategic communications that are likely to deploy framing functions:
- Political campaign messages with varying strategic goals
- Corporate communications addressing different stakeholder concerns
- Crisis management statements with different communication objectives
- Policy advocacy communications targeting different audiences

This corpus design will provide sufficient variation to test the framework's ability to distinguish between independent framing functions while maintaining analytical coherence.

## Success Criteria

1. **Framework-Corpus Fit**: The framework should demonstrate strong fit with the selected corpus, indicating appropriate analytical domain alignment.

2. **Function Pattern Recognition**: Case study analysis should reveal distinct patterns of framing function deployment, supporting Entman's independence hypothesis.

3. **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: The framework should identify distinct communication profiles based on framing function emphasis patterns.

4. **Message Completeness Assessment**: The framework should successfully measure how comprehensively communications address the complete framing spectrum.

## Methodological Notes

This experiment will use the Discernus platform's 3-run median aggregation system to reduce interpretive variance and improve analytical rigor. The framework's focus on independent analytical dimensions makes it particularly suitable for testing variance reduction in strategic communication analysis.

The experiment will provide empirical validation of Entman's framing theory while demonstrating the utility of systematic communication analysis in political and strategic communication research.
