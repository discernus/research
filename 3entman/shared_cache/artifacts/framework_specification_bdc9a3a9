This framework tests Entman's core hypothesis that strategic communication operates through distinct, independently variable framing functions that can be deployed separately to achieve communication goals. By analyzing Problem Definition, Causal Attribution, Moral Evaluation, and Treatment Recommendation as independent dimensions, this framework reveals the systematic construction of persuasive messages and enables empirical testing of framing theory's independence hypothesis.\n\n**Core Innovation**: Systematic communication analysis that treats framing functions as independent analytical dimensions rather than correlated message elements, enabling precise measurement of strategic communication patterns and message construction sophistication.\n\nIt is designed for political scientists, communication scholars, media analysts, and researchers studying strategic communication, framing theory, and political discourse analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Theoretical & Empirical Foundations\n\n### **Entman's Framing Theory (1993, 2007)**\n\nRobert Entman's seminal work established that framing operates through four distinct functions that can vary independently:\n\n1. **Problem Definition**: Establishes what issues require attention and how problems are conceptualized\n2. **Causal Attribution**: Assigns responsibility and explains problem origins  \n3. **Moral Evaluation**: Provides ethical framework and value judgments\n4. **Treatment Recommendation**: Advocates specific solutions and policy directions\n\n### **Independence Hypothesis**\n\nEntman's theory predicts these functions operate as independent analytical dimensions that can vary separately without necessary correlation. A communication may emphasize problem definition without moral evaluation, or propose solutions without extensive causal attribution. This independence enables strategic communication flexibility and message tailoring.\n\n### **Academic Validation**\n\n- **Entman, R. M.

This framework-corpus fit score is a key indicator of the research design's validity and will be provided in the final analysis results.\n\n### **Known Limitations & Scope**\n\nThis framework is specifically designed for strategic communication analysis and has clear boundaries of applicability. It is **unsuitable for**:\n- **Non-strategic texts**: Personal correspondence, technical documentation, or purely descriptive content where framing functions are not intentionally deployed\n- **Short-form content**: Brief statements, tweets, or headlines that lack sufficient length to assess multiple framing functions\n- **Non-persuasive discourse**: Factual reporting, academic writing, or neutral informational content without strategic intent\n- **Non-verbal communication**: Visual media, audio content, or other non-textual forms where linguistic framing markers cannot be identified\n\n**Potential pitfalls** include over-interpreting framing patterns in texts where they are minimal or absent, and misattributing strategic intent to naturally occurring language patterns. The framework should be applied with awareness of the speaker's communicative context and intent.\n\n---\n\n## Machine-Readable Framework Specification\n\n--- Start of Machine-Readable Appendix ---\n\n```yaml\nmetadata:\n  framework_name: \"entman_framing_functions\"\n  framework_version: \"10.0.0\"\n  spec_version: \"10.0\"\n  author: \"Robert Entman, adapted by Discernus Research Team\"\n\nanalysis_variants:\n  default:\n    description: \"Complete four-function framing analysis with independence testing\"\n    analysis_prompt: |\n      You are an expert analyst specializing in communication framing and strategic messaging. Analyze this text using the Entman Framing Functions Framework v10.0, which examines four independent framing functions based on Robert Entman's foundational communication theory.\n\n        **FRAMING FUNCTIONS TO ANALYZE:**\n\n        1. **Problem Definition** (0.0-1.0): What issues are identified as requiring attention and how problems are conceptualized. Look for: issue identification ('the real issue is,' 'we face a crisis of,' 'the challenge before us'), crisis framing ('urgent need,' 'what's really at stake'), scope setting ('affects everyone,' 'widespread implications').\n\n        2. **Causal Attribution** (0.0-1.0): What factors or actors are presented as causing problems and how responsibility is assigned. Look for: responsibility language ('X is responsible for,' 'this stems from Y's actions'), blame attribution ('the fault lies with,' 'caused by'), causal explanation ('due to,' 'resulted from,' 'roots of this problem').\n\n        3. **Moral Evaluation** (0.0-1.0): What values and moral judgments are invoked and how actions are evaluated ethically. Look for: value language ('justice demands,' 'fairness requires,' 'liberty is at stake'), moral judgment ('right thing,' 'wrong approach,' 'ethical'), values framework ('core values,' 'moral foundation,' 'ethical standards').\n\n        4. **Treatment Recommendation** (0.0-1.0): What solutions are proposed and how policy options are presented and prioritized. Look for: solution language ('we must,' 'need to,' 'the answer is'), policy options ('I propose,' 'recommend,' 'plan to'), action imperative ('take action,' 'immediate steps,' 'decisive action').\n\n        Analyze each framing function independently, scoring from 0.0-1.0 based on evidence strength and frequency, assessing salience (0.0-1.0) for strategic prominence, and providing specific quotations as evidence.
