Environmental Incident Apology
August 10, 2025

Dear Community Members,

We are writing to take full responsibility for the environmental incident that occurred at our facility on August 8, 2025. Our investigation has determined that the chemical spill was caused by equipment failure that we should have prevented through proper maintenance and oversight.

We deeply regret this incident and the impact it has had on our community and the environment. This failure represents a breach of our core values and our commitment to environmental stewardship. We have let down the people who trust us to operate safely and responsibly.

Our corrective actions include:
- Complete equipment overhaul and safety system upgrades
- Enhanced training for all personnel on environmental protocols
- Independent environmental audit and compliance review
- Community compensation fund for affected residents
- Regular public reporting on our environmental performance

We are committed to learning from this mistake and becoming a better corporate citizen. The trust of our community is precious, and we will work tirelessly to earn it back.

Sincerely,
The GreenEnergy Corp Leadership Team
