Congresswoman Davis
Healthcare Reform Advocacy
March 15, 2025

My fellow Americans, today I want to talk about a crisis that affects every family in this country - our broken healthcare system.

The problem is clear: millions of Americans cannot afford basic healthcare. Families are choosing between paying rent and paying medical bills. Parents are skipping doctor visits because they can't afford the co-pays. Seniors are rationing their medications to make them last longer.

This is not the America we want to be. Every family deserves access to quality, affordable healthcare. No one should have to choose between their health and their financial security.

Our solution is comprehensive healthcare reform that:
- Provides universal coverage for all Americans
- Controls prescription drug costs
- Expands mental health services
- Protects patients with pre-existing conditions
- Reduces administrative costs and waste

This is not about politics - it's about people. It's about ensuring that every American family can access the healthcare they need without going bankrupt.

The time for action is now. Let's build a healthcare system that works for everyone, not just those who can afford it.

Thank you, and let's work together to fix this crisis.
