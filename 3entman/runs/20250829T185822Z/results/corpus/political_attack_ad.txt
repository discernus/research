NARRATOR: "Senator Johnson's opponent has a record of failure and corruption that threatens our community."

"His policies have destroyed jobs, raised taxes, and left families struggling to make ends meet. When the economy crashed, he was nowhere to be found. When families needed help, he voted against relief programs."

"His moral character is questionable. He's been caught in multiple ethics violations, taking money from special interests while voting against the people's interests. He represents everything that's wrong with Washington politics."

"Senator Johnson stands for integrity, family values, and real solutions. Don't let corruption win. Vote Johnson for Senate."
