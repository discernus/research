    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with very explicit moral framing, making it straightforward to analyze using the Moral Foundations Theory framework. The dominant themes are anti-cheating/corruption and anti-oppression (fighting an 'oligarchy'), with a strong call for loyalty/solidarity among the working class as the solution. The individualizing foundations of care/harm and fairness are also highly present and salient. The authority and liberty foundations are notably absent, with the focus being on subverting existing power structures and collective action rather than respecting authority or emphasizing individual freedom."
