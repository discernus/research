      "description": "The experiment plans to conduct inferential statistical analyses, including 'correlation analysis' and 'reliability analysis', on a corpus of only 8 documents (N=8). According to the Experiment Specification v10.0, this sample size is insufficient for such tests and is only appropriate for 'Case study analysis, qualitative patterns, individual document insights'.",
      "impact": "The experiment will be blocked as it attempts an underpowered statistical analysis. Any results from the proposed inferential tests would be statistically invalid, unreliable, and violate the platform's minimum requirements for statistical power.",
      "fix": "Either (a) expand the corpus to a size appropriate for the desired analyses (e.g., N > 20 for meaningful correlation analysis), or (b) revise the 'Research Questions' and 'Expected Outcomes' in experiment.md to focus on qualitative analysis, descriptive statistics, and case studies, removing claims about achieving 'statistical confidence' through inferential methods.",

      "fix": "In the machine-readable appendix of 'mft_v10.md', change the `framework_version` from '1.0.0' to '10.0.0' to align with the framework's title and the experiment's context.",
