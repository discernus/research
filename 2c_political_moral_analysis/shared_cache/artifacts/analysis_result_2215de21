The primary moral argument centers on the betrayal of American citizens by a political and media elite, who are accused of prioritizing foreign interests and cheap labor over the well-being of the nation. The Individualizing foundations (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating) are present but almost exclusively applied to an in-group of 'American citizens,' particularly those in the 'heartland.' The Liberty foundation is notably absent, with the focus being on national sovereignty and collective well-being rather than individual freedom.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"care\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"harm\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"fairness\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"cheating\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"loyalty\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 1.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"betrayal\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"authority\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.4,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"subversion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"sanctity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.5,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.85\n        },\n        \"degradation\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.85\n        },\n        \"liberty\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"oppression\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"care\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"But my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country.
