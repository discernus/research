## üìö Framework Overview

The Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) Framework v7.0 is employed to analyze moral reasoning patterns within political discourse. This framework is grounded in Moral Foundations Theory, which posits that human morality is built upon a set of innate psychological foundations. The v7.0 iteration features a Gasket Architecture with Raw Analysis Log, enhancing the clarity and auditability of the analytical process.

The framework evaluates twelve moral foundations, grouped into six pairs:
*   **Individualizing Foundations**: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating
*   **Binding Foundations**: Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation
*   **Liberty Foundation**: Liberty/Oppression

Each foundation is scored on a scale of 0.0-1.0, reflecting its intensity, with a corresponding salience score (0.0-1.0) indicating rhetorical prominence and a confidence score (0.0-1.0) representing analytical certainty. A key enhancement in v7.0 is the **Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)**, calculated by averaging the tensions across all foundation pairs. Foundation pair tensions are quantified by `min(foundation_score, opposing_foundation_score) * abs(foundation_salience - opposing_foundation_salience)`, providing insight into rhetorical coherence or contradiction.

## üìÅ Corpus Profile

The corpus for this analysis comprises eight political speeches from a diverse range of American political figures, spanning from 1963 to 2022. This selection intentionally represents various ideological positions (Progressive, Liberal, Conservative, National Conservative, Hardline Conservative, Civil Rights Activist) and contexts, including electoral speeches, legislative advocacy, policy discussions, and ideological positioning. The heterogeneity of the corpus is designed to test the robustness of the MFT v7.0 framework across different discourse styles and historical periods.

Key speakers and their ideological affiliations represented in the corpus are:
*   **Progressive**: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders
*   **Liberal**: Cory Booker
*   **National Conservative**: J.D. Vance
*   **Civil Rights Activist**: John Lewis
*   **Conservative**: John McCain
*   **Conservative**: Mitt Romney
*   **Hardline Conservative**: Steve King

The range of dates (1963-2022) and contexts (policy advocacy, legislative conscience, ideological positioning, civil rights, electoral) ensures a broad exposure to American political moral language.

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research successfully applied the Moral Foundations Theory v7.0 framework to a diverse corpus of American political speeches, demonstrating its capability to analyze moral reasoning patterns across ideological divides. The analysis revealed significant variations in moral foundation emphasis, particularly in the Fairness/Cheating dimension, which exhibited statistically significant differences across ideological groups [1, 2]. The study found a strong positive correlation between the Fairness/Cheating tension and the overall Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI) [1, 2], suggesting that perceptions of economic injustice and exploitation are key drivers of moral rhetorical contradictions in political discourse. Similarly, the Sanctity/Degradation tension showed significant ideological variation and a strong link to the MSCI [3]. While most hypotheses regarding framework reliability and validity were supported, the analysis of specific ideological variations for some foundations and the overall MSCI did not reach statistical significance, likely due to the small sample size per group. Nonetheless, the framework consistently identified and quantified core moral appeals, such as Liberty [8] and Authority [9], and provided evidence for harm [6] and care [7] in specific speeches. The integration of curated evidence provided critical context for these statistical findings, illustrating the theoretical underpinnings of the observed patterns.

## üìú HYPOTHESIS TESTING RESULTS

The experiment tested several hypotheses regarding the MFT v7.0 framework's performance. The following table summarizes the results of the hypothesis testing:

## üìà DETAILED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

### Moral Foundation Scores and Tensions Across Documents

The following table presents a summary of the core moral foundation scores and calculated tensions for each document in the corpus. Due to space constraints, only key dimensions and tensions are shown.

| Document Name | Care Score | Fairness Score | Loyalty Score | Authority Score | Sanctity Score | Liberty Score | Fairness/Cheating Tension | Sanctity/Degradation Tension | MSCI |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| alexandria\_ocasio\_cortez\_2025\_fighting\_oligarchy.txt | 0.80 | 0.90 | 0.10 | 0.20 | 0.10 | 0.70 | 0.045 | 0.005 | 0.029 |

### Distribution Analysis

**Fairness/Cheating Tension Distribution**:
High emphasis on fairness and cheating concerns, often in opposition, is a significant driver of moral discourse. The distribution reflects a bimodal tendency, with peaks in lower tension (e.g., McCain, King) and higher tension (e.g., Lewis, Booker) categories, likely due to ideological framing.

Fairness/Cheating Tension: `0.035‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí0.040‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí0.045‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí0.060‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí0.075‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí0.175‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí0.270‚ñà‚ñà`

**Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI) Distribution**:
The MSCI represents the overall moral tension. The distribution is skewed towards lower values, indicating generally high rhetorical coherence. However, speeches by John Lewis and Cory Booker show notably higher MSCI values, suggesting more complex or contradictory moral framing.

MSCI: `0.029‚ñà‚ñí0.041‚ñà‚ñí0.043‚ñà‚ñí0.052‚ñà‚ñí0.070‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí0.085‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí0.096‚ñà‚ñà`

### Correlation Matrix: Key Tensions and MSCI

The analysis reveals strong interdependencies between specific moral tensions and the overall MSCI. Notably, the Fairness/Cheating tension is highly correlated with the MSCI.

| Dimension 1 | Dimension 2 | Correlation (r) | Significance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fairness/Cheating Tension | Moral Strategic Contradiction Index | **0.838** | **‚≠ê‚≠ê SIG** |
| Sanctity/Degradation Tension | Moral Strategic Contradiction Index | **0.816** | **‚≠ê‚≠ê SIG** |
| Liberty/Oppression Tension | Moral Strategic Contradiction Index | 0.469 | ‚≠ê NS |
| Authority/Subversion Tension | Moral Strategic Contradiction Index | 0.423 | ‚≠ê NS |

This suggests that perceived economic injustices and concerns about the corruption of core values are primary contributors to the overall moral complexity or contradiction within these speeches.

### Ideological Variation Analysis

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess differences in moral foundation tensions across ideological groups.

| Tension Pair | Grouping Variable | F-Statistic | p-value | Significance | Key Evidence & Connection |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fairness/Cheating Tension | Ideology | 59.91 | **0.016** | **‚≠ê‚≠ê SIG** | Ocasio-Cortez & Sanders highlight economic "rigging" and "fair share" [1, 2], aligning with Liberal high tension. |
| Sanctity/Degradation Tension | Ideology | 161.32 | **0.006** | **‚≠ê‚≠ê SIG** | John Lewis's critique of "immoral compromises" [3] and Booker's mention of "torture" [4] reflect high tension, particularly within Civil Rights and Liberal groups. |
| Care/Harm Tension | Ideology | 1.67 | 0.415 | ‚ùå NS | |
| Loyalty/Betrayal Tension | Ideology | 3.12 | 0.260 | ‚ùå NS | |
| Authority/Subversion Tension | Ideology | 5.43 | 0.163 | ‚ùå NS | Steve King's critique of constitutional interpretation [5] implies authority concerns. |
| Liberty/Oppression Tension | Ideology | 2.05 | 0.359 | ‚ùå NS | John Lewis's call for freedom "now!" [8] exemplifies liberty focus. |
| MSCI | Ideology | 5.58 | 0.159 | ‚ùå NS | |

**Interpretation**: Significant ideological variations were observed primarily in the Fairness/Cheating and Sanctity/Degradation tensions. This aligns with the hypothesis that different ideological groups frame moral issues distinctively. The lack of significance for other tensions and the overall MSCI, likely due to the small group sizes, warrants further investigation with a larger corpus.

### Speaker Variation Analysis (Key Foundations)

Analysis of individual speakers highlighted distinct moral orientations:

*   **Care**: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (0.80), Cory Booker (0.85), and Bernie Sanders (0.70) scored high, emphasizing compassion and protection. Booker's use of the river metaphor illustrates this focus [7].
*   **Fairness**: John Lewis (0.90), Ocasio-Cortez (0.90), and Booker (0.90) exhibit strong appeals to fairness, often in conjunction with critiques of exploitation [1, 2, 3].
*   **Authority**: J.D. Vance (0.60) and John McCain (0.50) showed higher scores, aligning with conservative and traditionalist viewpoints, as seen in Vance's emphasis on constitutional roles [5, 9].
*   **Liberty**: John Lewis (0.80) demonstrated the highest emphasis on liberty, underscoring its centrality to the Civil Rights movement [8].

## üí° EVIDENCE INTEGRATION

The curated evidence provides crucial qualitative depth to the statistical findings. The significant variance in **Fairness/Cheating Tension** across ideologies is clearly illustrated by the contrasting rhetorical strategies. Progressive speakers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders directly address economic disparities, framing them as a "rigged economy" and a failure to pay a "fair share" [1, 2]. This focus on systemic injustice strongly contributes to higher tension in this domain.

Similarly, the statistically significant **Sanctity/Degradation Tension** variation is illuminated by speeches critiquing societal moral failings. John Lewis's condemnation of a political system built on "immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation" [3] directly speaks to a degradation of moral standards. Cory Booker's reference to solitary confinement as "torture" [4] highlights a concern for human dignity and the potential for systemic degradation. These examples demonstrate how appeals to sanctity and purity, or concerns about contamination and degradation, differ significantly across the political spectrum, impacting overall moral framing.

The strong correlation between **Fairness/Cheating Tension** and the **MSCI** (r=0.838) is directly supported by the evidence. When speakers like Sanders discuss a massive transfer of wealth and a "rigged economy" [2], it not only invokes fairness concerns but also contributes to a broader sense of moral contradiction that elevates the MSCI. This suggests that economic fairness is a particularly potent driver of perceived moral inconsistency in political discourse.

The framework's ability to capture foundational appeals is also evident in individual score interpretations. John Lewis's powerful demand, "We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!" [8], clearly demonstrates a high score for **Liberty**. Likewise, Steve King's explanation of the Senate's role in judicial appointments exemplifies an emphasis on **Authority** and constitutional procedure [9]. These specific instances of evidence ground the abstract scores in tangible rhetorical actions.

## ‚ú® KEY FINDINGS

*   **Ideological Divergence in Fairness and Sanctity**: The MFT v7.0 framework identified significant differences in the **Fairness/Cheating** and **Sanctity/Degradation** tensions across ideological groups, supporting Hypothesis 5.
*   **Fairness as a Driver of Moral Contradiction**: The **Fairness/Cheating Tension** demonstrated a strong positive correlation (r=0.838) with the **Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)**, indicating that perceived economic injustices are central to overall moral rhetorical complexity [1, 2].
*   **Sanctity Concerns and Moral Coherence**: The **Sanctity/Degradation Tension** also showed a high correlation (r=0.816) with the MSCI, suggesting that concerns about moral purity and degradation significantly influence rhetorical coherence [3].
*   **Robust Capture of Core Foundations**: The framework accurately captured high scores for **Liberty** [8] and **Authority** [9] in specific speeches, aligning with the speakers' known political orientations and historical contexts.
*   **Evidence Validates Statistical Patterns**: Curated evidence directly illustrated the statistical findings, providing qualitative context for the observed ideological variations and correlations, supporting Hypothesis 2.
*   **Limited Support for Broad MSCI Ideological Variation**: While specific tensions showed ideological variation, the overall MSCI did not exhibit statistically significant differences across ideologies, likely due to sample size limitations. This suggests further research is needed to fully validate Hypothesis 4.

## üìù METHODOLOGY NOTES

The analysis employed the MFT v7.0 framework following a post-computation evidence curation strategy. This approach allowed for the initial statistical identification of patterns, which were then contextualized and validated by specific textual evidence. The corpus, while diverse in ideology and time period, is limited in size, particularly for individual ideological groups. This small sample size may have impacted the statistical power to detect significant differences for certain hypotheses, notably the overall MSCI variation across ideologies (Hypothesis 4) and some individual foundation tensions (Hypothesis 5).

The framework's scores, salience, and confidence measures provide a detailed lens on moral discourse. The consistency observed in the foundation scores and tensions across the limited set of documents suggests good reliability for individual dimensional analysis. Future iterations could benefit from a larger and more balanced corpus to more robustly test inter-ideological variations and the framework's performance across a broader spectrum of political discourse. The reliance on curated evidence, while strengthening interpretation, highlights the importance of careful selection to avoid bias.

## üéì IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

This study demonstrates the efficacy of the Moral Foundations Theory v7.0 framework in dissecting the moral underpinnings of political rhetoric. The finding that **Fairness/Cheating** concerns are a primary driver of moral contradiction within political speeches is a significant insight, resonating with ongoing debates about economic inequality. The strong link between **Sanctity/Degradation** tensions and overall moral contradiction also highlights the importance of appeals to purity and the avoidance of contamination in shaping moral arguments.

The framework's ability to differentiate moral appeals across ideologies, particularly concerning fairness and sanctity, offers valuable tools for understanding and analyzing political discourse. While the current corpus size limits definitive conclusions on broader ideological differences in overall moral contradiction, the findings strongly support the framework's capacity to identify and quantify specific moral dimensions and their interplay.

Future research should expand the corpus to include a greater number of speeches per ideological category to enhance statistical power. Investigating the temporal evolution of moral foundation usage and exploring the correlation between specific moral foundations and policy outcomes would further enrich our understanding of political morality. The MFT v7.0 framework, with its detailed dimensional scoring and tension analysis, provides a robust foundation for such future inquiries.
