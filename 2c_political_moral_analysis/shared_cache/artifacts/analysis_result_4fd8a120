The document exhibits a strong and clear moral framework characteristic of left-wing populist discourse. The dominant moral appeals are rooted in the Fairness/Cheating, Harm, and Oppression/Subversion dimensions, with the concept of a 'rigged economy' serving as the central organizing principle. Other foundations, such as Loyalty and Degradation, are present in a supporting capacity, while Authority and Liberty are notably de-emphasized or actively opposed.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"care\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"harm\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"fairness\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 1.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"cheating\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 1.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"loyalty\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"betrayal\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"authority\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"subversion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"sanctity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.3,\n          \"salience\": 0.2,\n          \"confidence\": 0.7\n        },\n        \"degradation\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.5,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"liberty\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"oppression\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"care\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"concern_for_vulnerable_populations\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"harm\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"...you would not feel obliged to step on the backs of poor people to become even richer.
