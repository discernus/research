I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\\n\\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. [LOYALTY: A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform.] [CARE: They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation.] Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our [HARM: savagely broken criminal justice system.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: I'm proud of this coalition.] [LOYALTY: I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum.] [LOYALTY: I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds.] [LOYALTY: This is how change has been made in this country for generations.] But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the [HARM: deeply savage, broken criminal justice system] that we have.\\n\\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of [HARM: failed policies] by this body that created [HARM: harsh sentences], [HARM: harsh mandatory minimum penalties], three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. [OPPRESSION: America is now the preeminent incarceration nation.] [OPPRESSION: We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.]\\n\\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, [OPPRESSION: one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America.] [OPPRESSION: One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America.] And today, [OPPRESSION: close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record.] [OPPRESSION: We have criminalized the United States population] - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\\n\\nBut after decades of [HARM: failed federal policies], and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. [DEGRADATION: Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation.] [SANCTITY: We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all.] [DEGRADATION: But our criminal justice system violates those values.]\\n\\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but [SANCTITY: you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation] by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are [CARE: marginalized in our society], [CARE: those who are most vulnerable in our society.]\\n\\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, [CARE: our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them.] [CARE: Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness.] [CARE: Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault], and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\\n\\n[CHEATING: This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others.] [CHEATING: The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.]\\n\\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when [LOYALTY: good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible.] I'm proud of my community.\\n\\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both [OPPRESSION: over-criminalized] and [CARE: under-protected] because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\\n\\n[CHEATING: We know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities.] We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, [SUBVERSION: she calls it the new Jim Crow] because of its [CHEATING: disproportionate impact on people of color.]\\n\\n[OPPRESSION: We now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850.] [OPPRESSION: This is a punishing reality.] [CHEATING: I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.]\\n\\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, [CHEATING: a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error.] [OPPRESSION: But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.]\\n\\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, [CHEATING: we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.] We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - [CHEATING: there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.]\\n\\n[CHEATING: This is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America.] [CHEATING: People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system.] [FAIRNESS: The scales of justice in America are not balanced.]\\n\\n[HARM: This is a system that hurts people], and [CARE: it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt.] What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? [OPPRESSION: What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life.] Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, [OPPRESSION: you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.]\\n\\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to [OPPRESSION: 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.]\\n\\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the [HARM: black hole of mass incarceration], [HARM: not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community.] [HARM: We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.]\\n\\n[HARM: We are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured], [OPPRESSION: to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history], and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - [HARM: less safe, not more.] And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to [CARE: warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.]\\n\\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and [CARE: warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them.] And we call this system a justice system. [FAIRNESS: It is not meant to be a system of retribution.] It's meant to be a justice system. [FAIRNESS: It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only.] [FAIRNESS: It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.]\\n\\n[SANCTITY: We are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation.] [SANCTITY: Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible.] One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\\n\\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\\n\\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because [SANCTITY: we are a nation that believes in redemption.]\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out [HARM: further harmed by the system], or [CARE: better able to start again], [CARE: better able to avoid more criminality], or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\\n\\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But [BETRAYAL: what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.]\\n\\n[HARM: This is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement.] [HARM: This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products.] [HARM: This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth.] [HARM: This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.]\\n\\n[CHEATING: It is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods.] In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. [DEGRADATION: This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country], and [HARM: it's hurting every single American.]\\n\\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why [LOYALTY: I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system.] [FAIRNESS: There's ways to make this system more fair.] [SANCTITY: There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.]\\n\\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will [OPPRESSION: reduce mandatory minimums] and [AUTHORITY: give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts.] Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the [CHEATING: racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity] has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. [FAIRNESS: It should be equal. It should be one to one], but we've made progress.\\n\\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, [CHEATING: there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase.] [FAIRNESS: We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.]\\n\\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that [LIBERTY: thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release], and it addresses some of the [CHEATING: racial disparities in our system] because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\\n\\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively [HARM: end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision.] This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way [CARE: women are treated behind bars.] This bill will [CARE: ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products] and [HARM: ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.] Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\\n\\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\\n\\n[LOYALTY: Let's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives.] Those are not just some people. [LOYALTY: When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans], because [BETRAYAL: we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.]\\n\\nDr. King said [FAIRNESS: justice is indivisible], and he was right. [OPPRESSION: We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole.] [BETRAYAL: It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.]\\n\\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, [FAIRNESS: \\\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\\\"] [BETRAYAL: We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole.] [DEGRADATION: Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound.] This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\\n\\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a [LOYALTY: bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point.] [LOYALTY: I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground] because [DEGRADATION: this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle] - [LIBERTY: values of freedom], [LIBERTY: values of liberty], [FAIRNESS: values of equality], [FAIRNESS: values of fairness] and [FAIRNESS: justice.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us.] [LOYALTY: This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity] - [SANCTITY: the ideals that were put forth by our founders] and [SANCTITY: that have been aspired to in every generation] and have been worked on in every generation, [SANCTITY: making us a more perfect union.]\\n\\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - [DEGRADATION: we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation.] But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, [SANCTITY: like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change.] [SANCTITY: We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve.] [SANCTITY: Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.]\\n\\n[SANCTITY: None of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption.] [LOYALTY: Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all.] And [LOYALTY: standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: Every single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions] because [LOYALTY: we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one.] [SANCTITY: We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.]\\n\\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. [CARE: It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected.] This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\\n\\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. [LOYALTY: May our work continue.]\\n\\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
