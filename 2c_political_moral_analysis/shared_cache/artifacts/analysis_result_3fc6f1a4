The speaker's discourse is exceptionally rich in explicit moral reasoning, making the identification of foundations and their salience relatively straightforward. The central theme is a conflict between Binding foundations (party loyalty) and a combination of Individualizing and other Binding foundations (justice, constitutional authority, sacred oath). The speaker resolves this conflict by prioritizing his oath to God (Sanctity) and the Constitution (Authority) to render impartial justice (Fairness) against what he frames as an act of corrupting the system (Cheating/Subversion).\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"care\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"harm\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"fairness\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"cheating\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"loyalty\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"betrayal\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.5,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"authority\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"subversion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"sanctity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"degradation\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"liberty\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"oppression\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"care\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"context_type\": \"Absence of evidence\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"harm\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"Description of harmful action\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"fairness\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"Statement of principle\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"cheating\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one\u2019s oath of office that I can imagine.\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"Characterization of action\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"loyalty\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"Many demanded, in their words, that I 'stand with the team.'
