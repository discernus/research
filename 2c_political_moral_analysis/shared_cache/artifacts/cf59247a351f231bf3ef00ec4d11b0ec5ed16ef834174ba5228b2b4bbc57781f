# Moral Foundations Theory Framework v7.0

**Version**: 7.0  
**Status**: Active  
**Major Change**: Gasket Architecture with Raw Analysis Log

A Discernus framework for analyzing moral reasoning patterns in political discourse using Moral Foundations Theory. This framework evaluates six moral foundation pairs with advanced tension analysis capabilities, providing comprehensive insights into moral strategic contradictions and rhetorical coherence patterns.

## Moral Foundations Theory Core Analysis

### **Six Foundation Pairs: Independent Scoring with Tension Analysis**

**Individualizing Foundations (Foundation Pairs 1-2)**:
1. **Care** (0.0-1.0): Compassion, protection, suffering prevention
2. **Harm** (0.0-1.0): Cruelty concern, violence prevention, victim advocacy

3. **Fairness** (0.0-1.0): Justice, equality, proportional treatment  
4. **Cheating** (0.0-1.0): Unfairness concern, exploitation prevention, corruption focus

**Binding Foundations (Foundation Pairs 3-5)**:
5. **Loyalty** (0.0-1.0): Group cohesion, fidelity, solidarity
6. **Betrayal** (0.0-1.0): Group abandonment concern, treachery prevention

7. **Authority** (0.0-1.0): Hierarchy respect, tradition, legitimate order
8. **Subversion** (0.0-1.0): Rebellion concern, tradition undermining, hierarchy disruption

9. **Sanctity** (0.0-1.0): Sacred preservation, purity, transcendence  
10. **Degradation** (0.0-1.0): Contamination concern, profane prevention, sacred violation

**Liberty Foundation (Foundation Pair 6)**:
11. **Liberty** (0.0-1.0): Freedom, autonomy, self-determination
12. **Oppression** (0.0-1.0): Control concern, domination prevention, freedom protection

### **Moral Tension Analysis Enhancement**

**Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)**: Quantifies overall moral tension across all foundation pairs, revealing patterns of moral rhetorical coherence or contradiction.

**Foundation Pair Tensions**: Each pair generates a tension score measuring the degree of simultaneous emphasis on opposing moral concerns.

### **Scoring Protocol**

For each foundation:
- **Score** (0.0-1.0): Intensity of moral foundation emphasis
- **Salience** (0.0-1.0): Rhetorical prominence and emphasis weight
- **Confidence** (0.0-1.0): Analytical confidence in the assessment

**Evidence Requirements**: 1-2 strongest supporting quotes per foundation with context classification.

## Framework Implementation

This framework employs the THIN philosophy: LLMs provide moral reasoning intelligence, while synthesis code handles mathematical calculations. The analysis focuses on raw dimensional scoring and evidence extraction, with all tension calculations performed by explicit code execution.

## Gasket Architecture

### Raw Analysis Log Format
The analysis agent outputs a raw analysis log containing:
- Moral foundation scores for all 12 dimensions across 6 pairs
- Salience weights for each dimension
- Evidence quotes with confidence ratings
- Qualitative reasoning about moral patterns

For each of the 12 foundations, provide: (1) score (0.0-1.0) representing intensity of moral foundation emphasis, (2) salience (0.0-1.0) representing rhetorical prominence, (3) confidence (0.0-1.0) representing analytical confidence.
