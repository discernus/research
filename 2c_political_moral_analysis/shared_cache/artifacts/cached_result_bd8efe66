No matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender identity, or status, no matter if you disagree with me on a couple of things. [CARE: If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here.] But I will say this, [BETRAYAL: those leaders on either side of the aisle who are willing to put their fellow Americans down], so that they can get ahead or feel better about themselves, those folks may best find a home somewhere else.

I didn't think so.\\n\\nNow it's this idea that if we just work hard, we too can have nation-state level money, except [CHEATING: these kinds of spoils aren't earned really.] [CHEATING: They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me.]\\n\\nJust look at what Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing to our healthcare, our veterans' benefits, and Social Security. [HARM: They are slashing programs that we and you have spent a lifetime paying into.] And by the way, not them, because those billionaires haven't paid their [FAIRNESS: fair share of taxes] in years.\\n\\nAnd let's talk about Medicaid and Medicare for a second because your representative, Dave Evans, you know that guy that hasn't been showing up for the last couple months? [HARM: Maybe he hasn't been showing up because he voted to cut Medicaid.]\\n\\nIn fact, every single House Republican voted to cut Medicaid and they'll tell you, \\\"No, I didn't. I didn't say that,\\\" but here's what it is. [CHEATING: They voted on a budget that cuts $880 billion from the committee that's in charge of Medicaid.] [CHEATING: And so now they're trying to play a game and say, \\\"We didn't do that,\\\" because they did by proxy.] [CHEATING: So let's set the record straight.]\\n\\nMass media and Fox News, and the right well have you believe that these [SANCTITY: American values] are something out of the Communist Manifesto. They believe that we think these things, because we went to some fancy college and read them in a book somewhere. But I'll tell you, [SANCTITY: I don't believe in healthcare, labor and human dignity], because I'm an extremist or a Marxist. [CARE: I believe it because I was a waitress, because I've scrubbed toilets with my mom to afford school, because I've worked double shifts to keep the lights on, because I lost my dad to cancer as a kid and had to see my mom open hospital bills in the days after. And I don't want us to live like this anymore], Greeley.\\n\\nThis isn't just about Republicans. [SUBVERSION: We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us too.] But, Greeley, that means our communities choosing and voting for Democrats and elected officials who know how to [LOYALTY: stand for the working class.]\\n\\nYou know which Coloradans did vote to gut Medicaid and jack up healthcare costs? [HARM: Gabe Evans and Lauren Boebert right next door.] So folks, you know what that means, right? [LOYALTY: We need to come together] [SUBVERSION: and spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors, and give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat who will stand for Colorado.]\\n\\nSo to all of those who came here today, unsure of whether this is where you belong, I want to tell you that you do. You do. Honestly, no matter who you voted for in the past. No matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender identity, or status, no matter if you disagree with me on a couple of things. [CARE: If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here.] But I will say this, [BETRAYAL: those leaders on either side of the aisle who are willing to put their fellow Americans down], so that they can get ahead or feel better about themselves, those folks may best find a home somewhere else. [LOYALTY: Because in this house, we stand together, we know that, that it's our only choice because we know that without exception, if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win.] [LIBERTY: if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win.]\\n\\nSo I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about [LOYALTY: class solidarity].\\n\\n[FAIRNESS: It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, \\\"Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.\\\"] [SANCTITY: Our lives deserve dignity] [FAIRNESS: our work deserves respect.]\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

But [BETRAYAL: you would think that if you had a few billion dollars or $10 or $20 billion, you would not feel obliged to step on the backs of poor people to become even richer]. But [CHEATING: that is exactly what they are doing right now]. [BETRAYAL: They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer.] [HARM: They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration] [CARE: They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer].\\n\\nThese guys have no sense of what goes on in the real world. They live in another planet. They own mansions all over the world. They go on vacations to their own private islands. When they want to go someplace, they don't go into their car. They go into the planes or the helicopters that they own. Send their kids to the best private schools and colleges. That is their world.\\n\\n[SANCTITY: Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people]. Well, [SUBVERSION: Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires]. [DEGRADATION: Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires]. [OPPRESSION: Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires].\\n\\nAnd what these guys are busy doing right now is [HARM: going after Medicaid], [CARE: going after Medicaid], [HARM: going after Social Security], [CARE: going after Social Security], [HARM: going after nutrition]. [CHEATING: The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on]. [BETRAYAL: The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on].\\n\\n[LOYALTY: You know why the American people are angry and they are angry all over this country]? [LIBERTY: You know why the American people are angry and they are angry all over this country?] They are angry because, believe it or not, despite a huge increase in worker productivity over the last 52 years, if you could believe it, [FAIRNESS: real inflation accounted for wages today are lower than they were 52 years ago]. Meanwhile, [FAIRNESS: there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%]. [CHEATING: That is what a rigged economy is about], and [SUBVERSION: that is what we are going to change].\\n\\nYou got a President Trump getting inaugurated. And I must tell you one of the more bizarre experiences of my life was I was kind of pushed into the front row of that. And there I am, there's Trump, and right behind him, you got Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg, three wealthiest guys in the country. And then behind them, you got 13 other billionaires who Trump nominated to head up various government agencies.\\n\\nI don't care if you are a Republican, Democrat, or independent, I don't think there's anybody who thinks it vaguely makes sense that [CHEATING: the richest guy in the world could spend $270 million to get Trump elected and then become the most powerful person in the government]. [SUBVERSION: That's not just Republicans. Let's be clear. Billionaires are funding the Democratic Party and preventing that party from standing up for working families]. [OPPRESSION: Billionaires are funding the Democratic Party and preventing that party from standing up for working families]. [BETRAYAL: Billionaires are funding the Democratic Party and preventing that party from standing up for working families].\\n\\nI don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%. So [LOYALTY: if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart], [SANCTITY: I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve]. [SUBVERSION: not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve].\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\\n\\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. [LOYALTY: A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform.] [CARE: They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation.] Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our [HARM: savagely broken criminal justice system.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: I'm proud of this coalition.] [LOYALTY: I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum.] [LOYALTY: I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds.] [LOYALTY: This is how change has been made in this country for generations.] But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the [HARM: deeply savage, broken criminal justice system] that we have.\\n\\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of [HARM: failed policies] by this body that created [HARM: harsh sentences], [HARM: harsh mandatory minimum penalties], three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. [OPPRESSION: America is now the preeminent incarceration nation.] [OPPRESSION: We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.]\\n\\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, [OPPRESSION: one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America.] [OPPRESSION: One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America.] And today, [OPPRESSION: close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record.] [OPPRESSION: We have criminalized the United States population] - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\\n\\nBut after decades of [HARM: failed federal policies], and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. [DEGRADATION: Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation.] [SANCTITY: We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all.] [DEGRADATION: But our criminal justice system violates those values.]\\n\\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but [SANCTITY: you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation] by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are [CARE: marginalized in our society], [CARE: those who are most vulnerable in our society.]\\n\\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, [CARE: our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them.] [CARE: Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness.] [CARE: Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault], and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\\n\\n[CHEATING: This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others.] [CHEATING: The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.]\\n\\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when [LOYALTY: good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible.] I'm proud of my community.\\n\\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both [OPPRESSION: over-criminalized] and [CARE: under-protected] because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\\n\\n[CHEATING: We know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities.] We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, [SUBVERSION: she calls it the new Jim Crow] because of its [CHEATING: disproportionate impact on people of color.]\\n\\n[OPPRESSION: We now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850.] [OPPRESSION: This is a punishing reality.] [CHEATING: I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.]\\n\\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, [CHEATING: a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error.] [OPPRESSION: But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.]\\n\\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, [CHEATING: we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.] We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - [CHEATING: there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.]\\n\\n[CHEATING: This is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America.] [CHEATING: People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system.] [FAIRNESS: The scales of justice in America are not balanced.]\\n\\n[HARM: This is a system that hurts people], and [CARE: it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt.] What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? [OPPRESSION: What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life.] Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, [OPPRESSION: you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.]\\n\\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to [OPPRESSION: 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.]\\n\\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the [HARM: black hole of mass incarceration], [HARM: not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community.] [HARM: We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.]\\n\\n[HARM: We are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured], [OPPRESSION: to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history], and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - [HARM: less safe, not more.] And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to [CARE: warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.]\\n\\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and [CARE: warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them.] And we call this system a justice system. [FAIRNESS: It is not meant to be a system of retribution.] It's meant to be a justice system. [FAIRNESS: It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only.] [FAIRNESS: It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.]\\n\\n[SANCTITY: We are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation.] [SANCTITY: Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible.] One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\\n\\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\\n\\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because [SANCTITY: we are a nation that believes in redemption.]\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out [HARM: further harmed by the system], or [CARE: better able to start again], [CARE: better able to avoid more criminality], or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\\n\\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But [BETRAYAL: what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.]\\n\\n[HARM: This is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement.] [HARM: This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products.] [HARM: This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth.] [HARM: This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.]\\n\\n[CHEATING: It is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods.] In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. [DEGRADATION: This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country], and [HARM: it's hurting every single American.]\\n\\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why [LOYALTY: I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system.] [FAIRNESS: There's ways to make this system more fair.] [SANCTITY: There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.]\\n\\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will [OPPRESSION: reduce mandatory minimums] and [AUTHORITY: give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts.] Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the [CHEATING: racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity] has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. [FAIRNESS: It should be equal. It should be one to one], but we've made progress.\\n\\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, [CHEATING: there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase.] [FAIRNESS: We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.]\\n\\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that [LIBERTY: thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release], and it addresses some of the [CHEATING: racial disparities in our system] because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\\n\\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively [HARM: end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision.] This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way [CARE: women are treated behind bars.] This bill will [CARE: ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products] and [HARM: ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.] Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\\n\\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\\n\\n[LOYALTY: Let's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives.] Those are not just some people. [LOYALTY: When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans], because [BETRAYAL: we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.]\\n\\nDr. King said [FAIRNESS: justice is indivisible], and he was right. [OPPRESSION: We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole.] [BETRAYAL: It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.]\\n\\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, [FAIRNESS: \\\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\\\"] [BETRAYAL: We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole.] [DEGRADATION: Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound.] This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\\n\\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a [LOYALTY: bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point.] [LOYALTY: I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground] because [DEGRADATION: this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle] - [LIBERTY: values of freedom], [LIBERTY: values of liberty], [FAIRNESS: values of equality], [FAIRNESS: values of fairness] and [FAIRNESS: justice.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us.] [LOYALTY: This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity] - [SANCTITY: the ideals that were put forth by our founders] and [SANCTITY: that have been aspired to in every generation] and have been worked on in every generation, [SANCTITY: making us a more perfect union.]\\n\\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - [DEGRADATION: we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation.] But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, [SANCTITY: like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change.] [SANCTITY: We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve.] [SANCTITY: Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.]\\n\\n[SANCTITY: None of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption.] [LOYALTY: Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all.] And [LOYALTY: standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: Every single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions] because [LOYALTY: we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one.] [SANCTITY: We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.]\\n\\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. [CARE: It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected.] This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\\n\\nWork to do in this country.

I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\\n\\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. [LOYALTY: A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform.] [CARE: They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation.] Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our [HARM: savagely broken criminal justice system.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: I'm proud of this coalition.] [LOYALTY: I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum.] [LOYALTY: I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds.] [LOYALTY: This is how change has been made in this country for generations.] But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the [HARM: deeply savage, broken criminal justice system] that we have.\\n\\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of [HARM: failed policies] by this body that created [HARM: harsh sentences], [HARM: harsh mandatory minimum penalties], three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. [OPPRESSION: America is now the preeminent incarceration nation.] [OPPRESSION: We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.]\\n\\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, [OPPRESSION: one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America.] [OPPRESSION: One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America.] And today, [OPPRESSION: close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record.] [OPPRESSION: We have criminalized the United States population] - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\\n\\nBut after decades of [HARM: failed federal policies], and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. [DEGRADATION: Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation.] [SANCTITY: We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all.] [DEGRADATION: But our criminal justice system violates those values.]\\n\\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but [SANCTITY: you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation] by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are [CARE: marginalized in our society], [CARE: those who are most vulnerable in our society.]\\n\\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, [CARE: our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them.] [CARE: Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness.] [CARE: Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault], and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\\n\\n[CHEATING: This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others.] [CHEATING: The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.]\\n\\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when [LOYALTY: good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible.] I'm proud of my community.\\n\\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both [OPPRESSION: over-criminalized] and [CARE: under-protected] because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\\n\\n[CHEATING: We know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities.] We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, [SUBVERSION: she calls it the new Jim Crow] because of its [CHEATING: disproportionate impact on people of color.]\\n\\n[OPPRESSION: We now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850.] [OPPRESSION: This is a punishing reality.] [CHEATING: I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.]\\n\\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, [CHEATING: a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error.] [OPPRESSION: But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.]\\n\\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, [CHEATING: we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.] We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - [CHEATING: there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.]\\n\\n[CHEATING: This is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America.] [CHEATING: People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system.] [FAIRNESS: The scales of justice in America are not balanced.]\\n\\n[HARM: This is a system that hurts people], and [CARE: it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt.] What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? [OPPRESSION: What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life.] Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, [OPPRESSION: you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.]\\n\\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to [OPPRESSION: 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.]\\n\\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the [HARM: black hole of mass incarceration], [HARM: not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community.] [HARM: We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.]\\n\\n[HARM: We are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured], [OPPRESSION: to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history], and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - [HARM: less safe, not more.] And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to [CARE: warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.]\\n\\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and [CARE: warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them.] And we call this system a justice system. [FAIRNESS: It is not meant to be a system of retribution.] It's meant to be a justice system. [FAIRNESS: It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only.] [FAIRNESS: It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.]\\n\\n[SANCTITY: We are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation.] [SANCTITY: Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible.] One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\\n\\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\\n\\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because [SANCTITY: we are a nation that believes in redemption.]\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out [HARM: further harmed by the system], or [CARE: better able to start again], [CARE: better able to avoid more criminality], or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\\n\\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But [BETRAYAL: what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.]\\n\\n[HARM: This is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement.] [HARM: This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products.] [HARM: This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth.] [HARM: This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.]\\n\\n[CHEATING: It is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods.] In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. [DEGRADATION: This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country], and [HARM: it's hurting every single American.]\\n\\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why [LOYALTY: I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system.] [FAIRNESS: There's ways to make this system more fair.] [SANCTITY: There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.]\\n\\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will [OPPRESSION: reduce mandatory minimums] and [AUTHORITY: give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts.] Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the [CHEATING: racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity] has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. [FAIRNESS: It should be equal. It should be one to one], but we've made progress.\\n\\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, [CHEATING: there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase.] [FAIRNESS: We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.]\\n\\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that [LIBERTY: thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release], and it addresses some of the [CHEATING: racial disparities in our system] because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\\n\\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively [HARM: end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision.] This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way [CARE: women are treated behind bars.] This bill will [CARE: ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products] and [HARM: ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.] Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\\n\\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\\n\\n[LOYALTY: Let's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives.] Those are not just some people. [LOYALTY: When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans], because [BETRAYAL: we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.]\\n\\nDr. King said [FAIRNESS: justice is indivisible], and he was right. [OPPRESSION: We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole.] [BETRAYAL: It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.]\\n\\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, [FAIRNESS: \\\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\\\"] [BETRAYAL: We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole.] [DEGRADATION: Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound.] This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\\n\\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a [LOYALTY: bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point.] [LOYALTY: I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground] because [DEGRADATION: this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle] - [LIBERTY: values of freedom], [LIBERTY: values of liberty], [FAIRNESS: values of equality], [FAIRNESS: values of fairness] and [FAIRNESS: justice.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us.] [LOYALTY: This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity] - [SANCTITY: the ideals that were put forth by our founders] and [SANCTITY: that have been aspired to in every generation] and have been worked on in every generation, [SANCTITY: making us a more perfect union.]\\n\\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - [DEGRADATION: we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation.] But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, [SANCTITY: like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change.] [SANCTITY: We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve.] [SANCTITY: Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.]\\n\\n[SANCTITY: None of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption.] [LOYALTY: Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all.] And [LOYALTY: standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: Every single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions] because [LOYALTY: we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one.] [SANCTITY: We know that that's not just a slogan.

I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\\n\\nWork to do in this country.

And so many of my colleagues ignore the basic realities of, of war. But I will say on the good news, the majority of the Republican house and the majority of the Republican Senate, the most recent cycle, said no more to this, no more, right? That's a good thing, that's progress. Even though we didn't win the debate, we're starting to win the debate within, within our own party. And I think that really matters. Now, just, just on that particular topic, I have to take a shot, I think, as I have done at every single NatCon, at the Wall Street Journal editorial page. I think actually every speech I've given in that NatCon, I, I, I know Bridge spoke earlier, or I was going to speak, Bridge, you're out there somewhere. Okay, sorry to tie you up in this nefarious business that I'm about to engage in. But the, [HARM: \\\"the dumbest of all possible foreign policy solutions and answers for our country is that we should let China make all of our stuff and we should fight a war with China.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"We should, we should, in my view, not fight a war with China if we can avoid it.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"We should also not let the Chinese make all of our stuff.\\\"] And yet, I've, I've seen the Wall Street Journal editorial page for the last couple of years say [CHEATING: \\\"we can indefinitely send munitions and weapons of war to Ukraine after for the past two generations abdicating that we ship our industrial base over overseas.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"It doesn't make any sense.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"It's sort of the perfect encapsulation of the dumbest way to govern our country.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"Let's send our entire machinery for making war to countries that hate us and then let's spend what little stockpiles that we have on a war that has no obvious end in sight.\\\"] That's the Wall Street Journal editorial page approach. And I'm happy to say that [SUBVERSION: \\\"the Republican party is increasingly aggressively and with momentum rejecting it.\\\"] So that is a great achievement and a great amount of progress that we've made.\\n\\nAnother thing that we've made real progress on is even the libertarians, even the market fundamentalists. And I know we have a few in the audience and we won't beat up on you too much. I know Orrin's out there somewhere. Um, even they acknowledge that [CHEATING: \\\"you can't have unlimited free trade with countries that hate you.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"It would be, you, the, the equivalent of allowing the Nazi Germans in 1942 to make all of our ships and missiles.\\\"] People recognize that that era has come to a close. Even the people who are generally going to disagree with us about how much to protect American industry from this point forward, agree, [CHEATING: \\\"you can't let the Chinese make all of your stuff when you're engaged in a, I think, a long-term great power competition with the Chinese.\\\"] So we've made incredible progress there. And, and yet, I will say that as much as we've made some great progress, there are still these weird little pockets of the old consensus that continue to bubble to the surface and [SUBVERSION: \\\"continue to fight us on all of the most important questions.\\\"] So our work is hardly done here, uh, but I do think that we've made some significant progress.\\n\\nNow, the issue where I think we've made the most progress, and I, I have to say this is, you know, I think a lot of you agree with this, but where the national conservative movement has made the most progress, not just here, but I think overseas as well, is the recognition that [LOYALTY: \\\"the real threat to American democracy, it's not certainly not Donald Trump, it's not even some foreign dictator who doesn't like America or our values.\\\"] [OPPRESSION: \\\"The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more.\\\"] [LIBERTY: \\\"The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more.\\\"] [SUBVERSION: \\\"That is the threat to American democracy.\\\"] And I, I had, had a conversation with an English friend, uh, earlier today and, you know, one of the things that that's very obvious is that all over the Western world, in Germany, in the UK, in place after place after place, [LIBERTY: \\\"populations keep on telling their leadership that they want less immigration\\\"] and [OPPRESSION: \\\"their leadership keeps on refusing to listen to them.\\\"] This is like a [SANCTITY: \\\"fundamental broken translation function in our, in our sacred democracy\\\"] [DEGRADATION: \\\"that our elites don't seem to care about.\\\"] And why don't our elites seem to care about it? Well, number one, [CHEATING: \\\"they really benefit from the cheap labor.\\\"] Okay? Number two, [BETRAYAL: \\\"they actually don't really like the people who make up the domestic populations of their own country.\\\"] This, one of the things that we consistently find, uh, from the, you know, the UK elites to certainly the American elites, is [BETRAYAL: \\\"they seem to really not like their own fellow citizens,\\\"] even though the wars that they want are going to be, of course, fought by the people in the heartland and not by the people who are walking down the streets of Washington D.C. Um, but I, I, I, I, I, I digress and I apologize for that. But look, the, the, the thing on immigration is that [HARM: \\\"no one can avoid that it has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced.\\\"] Now, I remember getting in some argument with some loser on Twitter a year or so ago about whether immigration raised housing prices. And of course the argument is that, yeah, maybe immigrants take up some more demand for housing, but they, they build all the houses. [CHEATING: \\\"That's not true, by the way.\\\"] Go to Pennsylvania in Ohio, you'll see a lot of very native born citizens who still build houses. It's actually shocking, uh, but if you go, there are some towns in Ohio, um, where we actually had houses before the Immigration Act of 1964. I'm, I'm dead serious. We actually did build homes in the United States of America before [CHEATING: \\\"our elites flooded the zone with non-stop cheap labor.\\\"] And by the way, we can still do it. Those people can still do it. [FAIRNESS: \\\"They just want to get proper wages in the process.\\\"] Um, but thanks, John. But now everybody seems to agree that if you look at, for example, the, the, the United Kingdom, uh, if immigration, non-stop immigration was the way to create wealth and prosperity and lower home prices, then London would be doing great. And I got to tell you, I was in London last year and it's not doing so good. But you don't even have to go to London. You can go closer to home. The places in our own communities, in our own, uh, states that have the highest immigration rates are the places with the highest home prices. And it's not even, it's not, it's not a correlation versus causation issue. If you actually look at the metro zone by metro zone, if you go parcel by parcel, you can see that where you have more immigration, you have higher home prices. But it's not just that. There's a community called Springfield, Ohio. And it's very close to my heart because Springfield, Ohio, if any of you know the state of Ohio, is nearly a carbon copy of Middletown, Ohio, where I grew up. It's a population, sort of a small to medium-sized town, about 55,000 people. And you're not going to believe the statistic when I, when I repeat it to you because I didn't believe it when I first heard about it. But in the last four years, [HARM: \\\"thanks to Joe Biden's open border policies, the City of Springfield has gone from 55,000 residents to 75,000 residents.\\\"] The 20,000 resident Delta is almost all recent Haitian immigrants. Okay? In a town, a small town of Ohio, 20,000 people. Now, go to Springfield, go to Clark County, Ohio, and ask the people there whether they have been enriched by 20,000 newcomers in four years. [HARM: \\\"Housing is through the roof.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"People, middle-class people in Springfield who've lived there sometimes for generations cannot afford a place to live.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"A third, I heard this yesterday, a third of the local County Health budget is now tied up in giving free benefits to illegal immigrants.\\\"] And of course the left will fact check and say, \\\"Well, they're not illegal immigrants because [CHEATING: \\\"through the abuse of asylum laws and through Joe Biden's massive paroles, they are now no longer technically illegal aliens\\\"] because according to Joe Biden, nobody is an illegal alien.\\\" Um, [OPPRESSION: \\\"the only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here, according to the Biden administration.\\\"] [BETRAYAL: \\\"They're the people. They're the people, by the way, who are not allowed to have an opinion about what's going on in their country because they will be silenced. They will be censored. They will be called every name in the book.\\\"] But, but [HARM: \\\"Springfield, Ohio, has been overwhelmed.\\\"] And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people. But [LOYALTY: \\\"my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country.\\\"] [CARE: \\\"I'm a senator for the state of Ohio.\\\"] [FAIRNESS: \\\"Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country.\\\"] [BETRAYAL: \\\"And the fact, and the fact that this has happened is evidence that they're not.\\\"] And so, I, I want to come back to something that I, I started with here, which is that we've made a lot of progress. There have been things that have, that have been bad that have happened. I mean, you know, in my home state of Ohio, we've had a couple of ballot referenda that have not gone the right way. We lost some elections in 2022 that I think that we should have won. Of course, like I said earlier, not every foreign policy debate has gone in our direction. But by and large, [SUBVERSION: \\\"the national conservative movement is winning the debate and we're changing the conversation.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"We're doing that and the very, very basic and simple principle that American leaders should look out for Americans.\\\"] And by the way, I know for the Brits here, UK leaders should look out for citizens of the UK, or subjects, or whatever you guys call yourselves, and so on and on for other, other citizens of other countries. By the way, I have to beat up on the UK just one, one additional thing. I was talking with a friend recently, um, and we were talking about, you know, one of the big dangers in the, in the world, of course, is nuclear proliferation, though of course the Biden administration doesn't care about it. And uh, I was talking about, you know, what is the first truly Islamist country that will get a new nuclear weapon? And we were like, maybe it's Iran, you know, maybe Pakistan already kind of counts. And then we sort of finally decided maybe it's actually the UK since Labor just took over. But, but my Tory friends, I have to say, um, you guys have got to get, you got to get a handle on this. But neither here nor there, um, the reason I'm most optimistic about the future of this movement and [LOYALTY: \\\"the future of our country\\\"] is because [LOYALTY: \\\"for the first time in a very long time, it is clear that the leader of the Republican party is not some donor who's desperate for cheap labor and it's not some random person who claims to speak for this or that constituency.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"The leader of the Republican party is a guy who actually plans to put American citizens first, and that's Donald Trump.\\\"] And that, and that, and I remember in 2019, when I came to speak of this conference, and as you all know, um, and of course Trump knows because he has a memory like a steel trap. I almost wish his memory was as bad as Joe Biden's because he would forget about what I said about him in 2016. But, you know, I, I, I, I, I was a convert in 2019 to the cause of Trump's America First agenda. In many ways, I came here very much as a convert. And I was, I was cognizant of the fact that because I was a convert, uh, Trump had not yet taken over the Republican Party even in Washington D.C. Even in 2019, even though he was the president of the United States, there were people who were [SUBVERSION: \\\"aggressively pushing back against his influence,\\\"] who are already planning a return to, you know, basically reimplementing the Wall Street Journal editorial pages preferred positions. In 2019, I think that's over now. And I think that the fact that it's over is a huge, huge win for you guys. But most importantly, [LOYALTY: \\\"it's a huge win for the American people\\\"] because [CARE: \\\"the American people, again, they need people who put the interests of their own citizens first, of our own citizens first.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"And that's what this entire movement is all about.\\\"] And I think that's what the Trump presidency will be about if we give him another shot, as I expect that we will.\\n\\nLet me thank you. Let me, um, let me close just with an observation here. And I apologize to a few of you because a few of you have heard me give this riff, but I think that it's important because we're, you know, even though I think, um, we're in a very good place electorally in 2024, there's, of course, going to be a massive set of debates and conversations going forward. And one of the things that you hear people say, even on our side, that you hear people say is that America, um, is the first cradle nation. Okay? America is an idea. Now, America has really good ideas at the founding of our country. It was created by very brilliant men. The Constitution, of course, had this incredible influence and political theory and that's why it has stood the test of time. But [LOYALTY: \\\"America is not just an idea.\\\"] Though we were founded on great ideas, [LOYALTY: \\\"America is a nation.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"It is a group of people with a common history and a common future.\\\"] And yes, thank you. One of the parts of that commonality as a people is that [LIBERTY: \\\"we do allow newcomers to this country, but we allow them on our terms, on the terms of the American citizens.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"And that's the way that we preserve the continuity of this project from 200 years past to hopefully 200 years in the future.\\\"] And let me illustrate this in a particular way. I, I am married to the daughter of South Asian immigrants to this country. Incredible people, people who genuinely have enriched, uh, the country and in so many ways. And of course, I'm biased because I love my wife, but I, I believe that it's true. But when, when my wife and I got, when I proposed to her, uh, we were in law school. And I said, \\\"Honey, I come along with $120,000 worth of law school debt and a cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky.\\\" And that's what you're getting, right? And that cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky, if you drive down Kentucky Route 15 and go to Jackson, Kentucky, that's my family's ancestral home before we migrated to Ohio about 60, 70 years ago. That's where all of my relatives came from is, is the deep heart of Central Appalachia. This is Kentucky Coal Country. By the way, one of the 10 poorest counties in the entire United States of America. Uh, of course, our elites love to accuse the residents there of having white privilege. Go to Breathitt County, Kentucky, and tell me that these are privileged people. They are very hardworking people and they're very good people. And [LOYALTY: \\\"they are people who love this country not because it's a good idea, but because in their bones they know that this is their home and it will be their children's home and they would die fighting to protect it.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"That is the source of America's greatness, ladies and gentlemen.\\\"] And I represent, I get to represent millions of people in the state of Ohio who are exactly like that. But in that cemetery, in that cemetery, there are people who were born around the time of the American Civil War. And if, as I hope, my, my wife and I eventually are laid to rest there and our kids follow us, there will be seven generations just in that small mountain cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky. Seven generations of people who have fought for this country, who have built this country, who have made things in this country and who would fight and die to protect this country if they were asked to. They, that, that, that [LOYALTY: \\\"is not just an idea.\\\"] That is not just a set of principles, even though the ideas and the principles are great. [SANCTITY: \\\"That is a homeland.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"People don't go and fight and die just for principles. They also, importantly, they go and fight and die for their home, for their families, and for the future of their children.\\\"] If this movement is going to go anywhere and if this country is going to thrive, [LOYALTY: \\\"we have to remember that America is a nation.\\\"] We're going to disagree sometimes about how best to serve that nation. We're going to disagree, of course, even within this room about how to best accomplish the reinvigoration of American industry and the renewal of American family. That's fine. But never forget that why we exist, why we do this, why we care about all those great ideas is because I would like ament for my kids to lay me to rest in that cemetery. And I would like them to know that [LOYALTY: \\\"the United States of America is as strong and as proud and as great as ever.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"Let's get to work to make that happen.\\\"] God bless you guys and thank you. Thank you. Bye guys. Thank you.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

And so many of my colleagues ignore the basic realities of, of war. But I will say on the good news, the majority of the Republican house and the majority of the Republican Senate, the most recent cycle, said no more to this, no more, right? That's a good thing, that's progress. Even though we didn't win the debate, we're starting to win the debate within, within our own party. And I think that really matters. Now, just, just on that particular topic, I have to take a shot, I think, as I have done at every single NatCon, at the Wall Street Journal editorial page. I think actually every speech I've given in that NatCon, I, I, I know Bridge spoke earlier, or I was going to speak, Bridge, you're out there somewhere. Okay, sorry to tie you up in this nefarious business that I'm about to engage in. But the, [HARM: \\\"the dumbest of all possible foreign policy solutions and answers for our country is that we should let China make all of our stuff and we should fight a war with China.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"We should, we should, in my view, not fight a war with China if we can avoid it.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"We should also not let the Chinese make all of our stuff.\\\"] And yet, I've, I've seen the Wall Street Journal editorial page for the last couple of years say [CHEATING: \\\"we can indefinitely send munitions and weapons of war to Ukraine after for the past two generations abdicating that we ship our industrial base over overseas.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"It doesn't make any sense.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"It's sort of the perfect encapsulation of the dumbest way to govern our country.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"Let's send our entire machinery for making war to countries that hate us and then let's spend what little stockpiles that we have on a war that has no obvious end in sight.\\\"] That's the Wall Street Journal editorial page approach. And I'm happy to say that [SUBVERSION: \\\"the Republican party is increasingly aggressively and with momentum rejecting it.\\\"] So that is a great achievement and a great amount of progress that we've made.\\n\\nAnother thing that we've made real progress on is even the libertarians, even the market fundamentalists. And I know we have a few in the audience and we won't beat up on you too much. I know Orrin's out there somewhere. Um, even they acknowledge that [CHEATING: \\\"you can't have unlimited free trade with countries that hate you.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"It would be, you, the, the equivalent of allowing the Nazi Germans in 1942 to make all of our ships and missiles.\\\"] People recognize that that era has come to a close. Even the people who are generally going to disagree with us about how much to protect American industry from this point forward, agree, [CHEATING: \\\"you can't let the Chinese make all of your stuff when you're engaged in a, I think, a long-term great power competition with the Chinese.\\\"] So we've made incredible progress there. And, and yet, I will say that as much as we've made some great progress, there are still these weird little pockets of the old consensus that continue to bubble to the surface and [SUBVERSION: \\\"continue to fight us on all of the most important questions.\\\"] So our work is hardly done here, uh, but I do think that we've made some significant progress.\\n\\nNow, the issue where I think we've made the most progress, and I, I have to say this is, you know, I think a lot of you agree with this, but where the national conservative movement has made the most progress, not just here, but I think overseas as well, is the recognition that [LOYALTY: \\\"the real threat to American democracy, it's not certainly not Donald Trump, it's not even some foreign dictator who doesn't like America or our values.\\\"] [OPPRESSION: \\\"The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more.\\\"] [LIBERTY: \\\"The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more.\\\"] [SUBVERSION: \\\"That is the threat to American democracy.\\\"] And I, I had, had a conversation with an English friend, uh, earlier today and, you know, one of the things that that's very obvious is that all over the Western world, in Germany, in the UK, in place after place after place, [LIBERTY: \\\"populations keep on telling their leadership that they want less immigration\\\"] and [OPPRESSION: \\\"their leadership keeps on refusing to listen to them.\\\"] This is like a [SANCTITY: \\\"fundamental broken translation function in our, in our sacred democracy\\\"] [DEGRADATION: \\\"that our elites don't seem to care about.\\\"] And why don't our elites seem to care about it? Well, number one, [CHEATING: \\\"they really benefit from the cheap labor.\\\"] Okay? Number two, [BETRAYAL: \\\"they actually don't really like the people who make up the domestic populations of their own country.\\\"] This, one of the things that we consistently find, uh, from the, you know, the UK elites to certainly the American elites, is [BETRAYAL: \\\"they seem to really not like their own fellow citizens,\\\"] even though the wars that they want are going to be, of course, fought by the people in the heartland and not by the people who are walking down the streets of Washington D.C. Um, but I, I, I, I, I, I digress and I apologize for that. But look, the, the, the thing on immigration is that [HARM: \\\"no one can avoid that it has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced.\\\"] Now, I remember getting in some argument with some loser on Twitter a year or so ago about whether immigration raised housing prices. And of course the argument is that, yeah, maybe immigrants take up some more demand for housing, but they, they build all the houses. [CHEATING: \\\"That's not true, by the way.\\\"] Go to Pennsylvania in Ohio, you'll see a lot of very native born citizens who still build houses. It's actually shocking, uh, but if you go, there are some towns in Ohio, um, where we actually had houses before the Immigration Act of 1964. I'm, I'm dead serious. We actually did build homes in the United States of America before [CHEATING: \\\"our elites flooded the zone with non-stop cheap labor.\\\"] And by the way, we can still do it. Those people can still do it. [FAIRNESS: \\\"They just want to get proper wages in the process.\\\"] Um, but thanks, John. But now everybody seems to agree that if you look at, for example, the, the, the United Kingdom, uh, if immigration, non-stop immigration was the way to create wealth and prosperity and lower home prices, then London would be doing great. And I got to tell you, I was in London last year and it's not doing so good. But you don't even have to go to London. You can go closer to home. The places in our own communities, in our own, uh, states that have the highest immigration rates are the places with the highest home prices. And it's not even, it's not, it's not a correlation versus causation issue. If you actually look at the metro zone by metro zone, if you go parcel by parcel, you can see that where you have more immigration, you have higher home prices. But it's not just that. There's a community called Springfield, Ohio. And it's very close to my heart because Springfield, Ohio, if any of you know the state of Ohio, is nearly a carbon copy of Middletown, Ohio, where I grew up. It's a population, sort of a small to medium-sized town, about 55,000 people. And you're not going to believe the statistic when I, when I repeat it to you because I didn't believe it when I first heard about it. But in the last four years, [HARM: \\\"thanks to Joe Biden's open border policies, the City of Springfield has gone from 55,000 residents to 75,000 residents.\\\"] The 20,000 resident Delta is almost all recent Haitian immigrants. Okay? In a town, a small town of Ohio, 20,000 people. Now, go to Springfield, go to Clark County, Ohio, and ask the people there whether they have been enriched by 20,000 newcomers in four years. [HARM: \\\"Housing is through the roof.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"People, middle-class people in Springfield who've lived there sometimes for generations cannot afford a place to live.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"A third, I heard this yesterday, a third of the local County Health budget is now tied up in giving free benefits to illegal immigrants.\\\"] And of course the left will fact check and say, \\\"Well, they're not illegal immigrants because [CHEATING: \\\"through the abuse of asylum laws and through Joe Biden's massive paroles, they are now no longer technically illegal aliens\\\"] because according to Joe Biden, nobody is an illegal alien.\\\" Um, [OPPRESSION: \\\"the only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here, according to the Biden administration.\\\"] [BETRAYAL: \\\"They're the people. They're the people, by the way, who are not allowed to have an opinion about what's going on in their country because they will be silenced. They will be censored. They will be called every name in the book.\\\"] But, but [HARM: \\\"Springfield, Ohio, has been overwhelmed.\\\"] And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people. But [LOYALTY: \\\"my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country.\\\"] [CARE: \\\"I'm a senator for the state of Ohio.\\\"] [FAIRNESS: \\\"Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country.\\\"] [BETRAYAL: \\\"And the fact, and the fact that this has happened is evidence that they're not.\\\"] And so, I, I want to come back to something that I, I started with here, which is that we've made a lot of progress. There have been things that have, that have been bad that have happened. I mean, you know, in my home state of Ohio, we've had a couple of ballot referenda that have not gone the right way. We lost some elections in 2022 that I think that we should have won. Of course, like I said earlier, not every foreign policy debate has gone in our direction. But by and large, [SUBVERSION: \\\"the national conservative movement is winning the debate and we're changing the conversation.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"We're doing that and the very, very basic and simple principle that American leaders should look out for Americans.\\\"] And by the way, I know for the Brits here, UK leaders should look out for citizens of the UK, or subjects, or whatever you guys call yourselves, and so on and on for other, other citizens of other countries. By the way, I have to beat up on the UK just one, one additional thing. I was talking with a friend recently, um, and we were talking about, you know, one of the big dangers in the, in the world, of course, is nuclear proliferation, though of course the Biden administration doesn't care about it. And uh, I was talking about, you know, what is the first truly Islamist country that will get a new nuclear weapon? And we were like, maybe it's Iran, you know, maybe Pakistan already kind of counts. And then we sort of finally decided maybe it's actually the UK since Labor just took over. But, but my Tory friends, I have to say, um, you guys have got to get, you got to get a handle on this. But neither here nor there, um, the reason I'm most optimistic about the future of this movement and [LOYALTY: \\\"the future of our country\\\"] is because [LOYALTY: \\\"for the first time in a very long time, it is clear that the leader of the Republican party is not some donor who's desperate for cheap labor and it's not some random person who claims to speak for this or that constituency.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"The leader of the Republican party is a guy who actually plans to put American citizens first, and that's Donald Trump.\\\"] And that, and that, and I remember in 2019, when I came to speak of this conference, and as you all know, um, and of course Trump knows because he has a memory like a steel trap. I almost wish his memory was as bad as Joe Biden's because he would forget about what I said about him in 2016. But, you know, I, I, I, I, I was a convert in 2019 to the cause of Trump's America First agenda. In many ways, I came here very much as a convert. And I was, I was cognizant of the fact that because I was a convert, uh, Trump had not yet taken over the Republican Party even in Washington D.C. Even in 2019, even though he was the president of the United States, there were people who were [SUBVERSION: \\\"aggressively pushing back against his influence,\\\"] who are already planning a return to, you know, basically reimplementing the Wall Street Journal editorial pages preferred positions. In 2019, I think that's over now. And I think that the fact that it's over is a huge, huge win for you guys. But most importantly, [LOYALTY: \\\"it's a huge win for the American people\\\"] because [CARE: \\\"the American people, again, they need people who put the interests of their own citizens first, of our own citizens first.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"And that's what this entire movement is all about.\\\"] And I think that's what the Trump presidency will be about if we give him another shot, as I expect that we will.\\n\\nLet me thank you. Let me, um, let me close just with an observation here. And I apologize to a few of you because a few of you have heard me give this riff, but I think that it's important because we're, you know, even though I think, um, we're in a very good place electorally in 2024, there's, of course, going to be a massive set of debates and conversations going forward. And one of the things that you hear people say, even on our side, that you hear people say is that America, um, is the first cradle nation. Okay? America is an idea. Now, America has really good ideas at the founding of our country. It was created by very brilliant men. The Constitution, of course, had this incredible influence and political theory and that's why it has stood the test of time. But [LOYALTY: \\\"America is not just an idea.\\\"] Though we were founded on great ideas, [LOYALTY: \\\"America is a nation.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"It is a group of people with a common history and a common future.\\\"] And yes, thank you. One of the parts of that commonality as a people is that [LIBERTY: \\\"we do allow newcomers to this country, but we allow them on our terms, on the terms of the American citizens.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"And that's the way that we preserve the continuity of this project from 200 years past to hopefully 200 years in the future.\\\"] And let me illustrate this in a particular way. I, I am married to the daughter of South Asian immigrants to this country. Incredible people, people who genuinely have enriched, uh, the country and in so many ways. And of course, I'm biased because I love my wife, but I, I believe that it's true. But when, when my wife and I got, when I proposed to her, uh, we were in law school. And I said, \\\"Honey, I come along with $120,000 worth of law school debt and a cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky.\\\" And that's what you're getting, right? And that cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky, if you drive down Kentucky Route 15 and go to Jackson, Kentucky, that's my family's ancestral home before we migrated to Ohio about 60, 70 years ago. That's where all of my relatives came from is, is the deep heart of Central Appalachia. This is Kentucky Coal Country. By the way, one of the 10 poorest counties in the entire United States of America. Uh, of course, our elites love to accuse the residents there of having white privilege. Go to Breathitt County, Kentucky, and tell me that these are privileged people. They are very hardworking people and they're very good people. And [LOYALTY: \\\"they are people who love this country not because it's a good idea, but because in their bones they know that this is their home and it will be their children's home and they would die fighting to protect it.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"That is the source of America's greatness, ladies and gentlemen.\\\"] And I represent, I get to represent millions of people in the state of Ohio who are exactly like that. But in that cemetery, in that cemetery, there are people who were born around the time of the American Civil War. And if, as I hope, my, my wife and I eventually are laid to rest there and our kids follow us, there will be seven generations just in that small mountain cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky. Seven generations of people who have fought for this country, who have built this country, who have made things in this country and who would fight and die to protect this country if they were asked to. They, that, that, that [LOYALTY: \\\"is not just an idea.\\\"] That is not just a set of principles, even though the ideas and the principles are great. [SANCTITY: \\\"That is a homeland.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"People don't go and fight and die just for principles. They also, importantly, they go and fight and die for their home, for their families, and for the future of their children.\\\"] If this movement is going to go anywhere and if this country is going to thrive, [LOYALTY: \\\"we have to remember that America is a nation.\\\"] We're going to disagree sometimes about how best to serve that nation. We're going to disagree, of course, even within this room about how to best accomplish the reinvigoration of American industry and the renewal of American family. That's fine. But never forget that why we exist, why we do this, why we care about all those great ideas is because I would like ament for my kids to lay me to rest in that cemetery. And I would like them to know that [LOYALTY: \\\"the United States of America is as strong and as proud and as great as ever.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"Let's get to work to make that happen.\\\"] God bless you guys and thank you. Thank you. Bye guys. Thank you.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

[FAIRNESS: The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly.] [AUTHORITY: A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Senator Barack Obama to congratulate him] - please - [AUTHORITY: to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.] [LOYALTY: the country that we both love.]\\n\\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, [AUTHORITY: his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance.] But that he managed to do so by [CARE: inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president] is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\\n\\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. [LIBERTY: I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it.] Senator Obama believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from [DEGRADATION: the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation] and [OPPRESSION: denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship], [DEGRADATION: the memory of them still had the power to wound.]\\n\\nA century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from [DEGRADATION: the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time.] There is no better evidence of this than [FAIRNESS: the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States.] [Applause]\\n\\nLet there be no reason now for any American to fail to [LOYALTY: cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth.] [SANCTITY: the greatest nation on Earth.] [AUTHORITY: Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country.] I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though [SANCTITY: our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator] and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\\n\\nSenator Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and [FAIRNESS: he has prevailed.] No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and [AUTHORITY: I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.] [CARE: help him lead us through the many challenges we face.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: I urge all Americans] - [LOYALTY: I urge all Americans who supported me to join me] in not just congratulating him, but offering [CARE: our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences] and [CARE: help restore our prosperity], [HARM: defend our security in a dangerous world], and [CARE: leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.] [LOYALTY: leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans], and please believe me when I say [LOYALTY: no association has ever meant more to me than that.] [Applause]\\n\\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and [CARE: work together to get our country moving again.] We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\\n\\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\\n\\nI'm especially grateful to my wife Cindy, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\\n\\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\\n\\nI am also, of course, very thankful to Governor Sarah Palin - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her husband Todd and their five beautiful children, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to Alaska, the Republican Party, and [LOYALTY: our country].\\n\\nTo all my campaign comrades, from Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\\n\\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\\n\\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for [FAIRNESS: giving me a fair hearing before deciding] [AUTHORITY: that Senator Obama and my old friend Senator Joe Biden should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.]\\n\\n[Please, please] I would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of [LOYALTY: serving this country for a half a century.] Today I was a candidate for the [AUTHORITY: highest office in the country I love so much], and tonight [LOYALTY: I remain her servant]. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of Arizona for it.\\n\\nTonight - tonight more than any night - [CARE: I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens], [LOYALTY: whether they supported me or Senator Obama.] [AUTHORITY: I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president], and [LOYALTY: I call on all Americans], as I have often in this campaign, [CARE: to not despair of our present difficulties], but to [SANCTITY: believe always in the promise and greatness of America.] [LOYALTY: believe always in the promise and greatness of America.]\\n\\nBecause nothing is inevitable here. [LOYALTY: Americans never quit.] [LOYALTY: We never surrender.] [LOYALTY: We never hide from history.] [LOYALTY: We make history.]\\n\\nThank you, and [SANCTITY: God bless you], and [SANCTITY: God bless America.] [LOYALTY: God bless America.] Thank you all very much.\\n\\n[Applause] \\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\n[AUTHORITY: \\\"The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success,\\\"] and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. [AUTHORITY: \\\"The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it.\\\"] We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\\n\\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. [SANCTITY: \\\"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\\\"] I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, [LOYALTY: \\\"the leader of my own party,\\\"] would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\\n\\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\\n\\nLet me first address those three defenses. [AUTHORITY: \\\"The historic meaning of the words 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office.\\\"] To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\\n\\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\\n\\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, [CHEATING: \\\"taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime.\\\"] Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, [CHEATING: \\\"the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit.\\\"] There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\\n\\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with [AUTHORITY: \\\"the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large.\\\"] So [AUTHORITY: \\\"the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution.\\\"] The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\\n\\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\\n\\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. [CARE: \\\"The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so.\\\"] [CARE: \\\"The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"The president's purpose was personal and political.\\\"] Accordingly, [HARM: \\\"the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\\\"] [DEGRADATION: \\\"Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\\\"]\\n\\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, [HARM: \\\"it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.\\\"] [DEGRADATION: \\\"No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.\\\"] [LIBERTY: \\\"No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights,\\\"] [OPPRESSION: \\\"No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights,\\\"] our national security, and our [SANCTITY: \\\"fundamental values.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\\\"] [SUBVERSION: \\\"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\\\"] [BETRAYAL: \\\"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\\\"] [DEGRADATION: \\\"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\\\"] [OPPRESSION: \\\"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\\\"]\\n\\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. [LOYALTY: \\\"Many demanded, in their words, that I 'stand with the team.'\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time.\\\"] But [FAIRNESS: \\\"my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\\\"]\\n\\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my [SANCTITY: \\\"oath and the Constitution demands of me\\\"] for the sake of a partisan end, [BETRAYAL: \\\"it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\\\"]\\n\\n[LOYALTY: \\\"I'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced.\\\"] I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an [SANCTITY: \\\"inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\\\"]\\n\\nLike each member of this deliberative body, [LOYALTY: \\\"I love our country.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence.\\\"] [LIBERTY: \\\"I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character.\\\"] As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\\n\\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: [FAIRNESS: \\\"the judgment of the American people.\\\"] Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\\n\\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\\n\\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, [LIBERTY: \\\"the nation conceived in liberty and justice,\\\"] [FAIRNESS: \\\"the nation conceived in liberty and justice,\\\"] that distinction is enough for any citizen.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.

It's my privilege to have the opportunity to address you here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. I have listened to a lot of discussion here with which I disagree, of course, and uh, but I keep hearing this term, \\\"do your job, do your job.\\\" It seems to echo out of the left constantly, \\\"do your job.\\\" And uh, the argument is that one of the arguments is that the President of the United States has a [AUTHORITY: \\\"constitutional right to nominate to the Supreme Court.\\\"] Well, he does, that's pretty clear in the Constitution. However, the Senate determines what advice is and the Senate determines that which is consent. And no nomination to the federal court can move forward without the Senate's advice and consent. [AUTHORITY: \\\"It's the Senate's job then to evaluate the nominations of the President.\\\"] And they can do so with or without hearings, with or without interviews. [AUTHORITY: \\\"The Senate writes its own rules just like the House writes its own rules, Mr. Speaker.\\\"] And so I'd like to put this back in perspective here. We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that [SUBVERSION: \\\"the Constitution means what they want it to mean and they want to read it uh to say what they want it to say rather than what it actually says and rather than what it actually was understood to mean at the time of its ratification.\\\"] [DEGRADATION: \\\"And when you have justices to the Supreme Court that, that embody that belief and act on that belief, then we here who take an oath to support and defend the Constitution\u2014and that's actually all of us here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, and everyone in the United States Senate for that matter\u2014we recognize that if we're going to support and defend the Constitution, encouraging the, the nomination and the advice and the consent, the confirmation of the Senate and encouraging then a presidential appointment to the Supreme Court of someone whom the President is incapable of nominating anyone to the Supreme Court that what the Constitution says and what was understood to mean at the time of its ratification, he's demonstrated that in the past with his appointments to the court.\\\"] He will demonstrate that again. [SANCTITY: \\\"We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend.\\\"] [CARE: \\\"We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend.\\\"] And so our obligation then is to say, \\\"Mr. President, you're lame duck. [LOYALTY: \\\"Let's stick with the tradition. Let's stick with the practice. Let's stick with the statements that have been made by a number of Democrats in the past when the shoe was on the other foot.\\\"] People like Joe Biden and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer all would agree with Senator Chuck Grassley. No hearing, no, no confirmation in the Senate, no vote in the in the Judiciary Committee, and no vote on the floor of the Senate for this lame duck President's appointments because we have a Constitution that's got to be restored. And instead of being restored, [DEGRADATION: \\\"it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment.\\\"]\\n\\nWe were sitting with a deadlocked court that sat four and a half to four and a half out of a nine-member court. And you could kind of toss a coin on whether you would get a decision that came down on [SANCTITY: \\\"what the Constitution said and what the law said\\\"] or what they preferred the policy was. An example of that. Got a couple of bad examples. This is even with the Stellar Justice Scalia sitting on the bench not even a year ago, June 24th and June 25th. On the 24th of June, the court came down with a decision King versus Burwell where [CHEATING: \\\"the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court decided that he could write words into Obamacare that didn't exist.\\\"] They were not passed by this Congress, not by either chamber of this Congress. As a matter of fact, it wasn't a phrase that was, that was conferenced out or something that was contested. It never was in the bill. The phrase that said, \\\"or federal government.\\\" And that's the, that's the component that had it been in Obamacare, then the federal government could have gone into the states and established the exchanges in the states that ref establish exchanges to comply with the suggestion that came from this Congress, by the way, that came from this Congress by hook, by crook, by legislative shenanigan, just to quote some Democrats that lamented at the methodology they had to go through to push Obamacare down the throats of the American people. But in any case, the law never said and never, never enabled the federal government to establish exchanges in the states. And [AUTHORITY: \\\"the Constitution doesn't allow that authority, in my opinion. There's no enumerated power for the federal government to to create exchanges for, for insurance health insurance policies within the states.\\\"] But the Supreme Court ruled with the majority opinion written by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, but they could add words into the Obamacare where it says, \\\"the states may establish exchanges.\\\" They, [CHEATING: \\\"they added, 'the states or federal government may establish exchanges.' They made it up.\\\"] And they wrapped themselves in the cloak of constitutional authority in Marberry versus Madison and a whole series of presumably precedent cases along the line. And that was June 24th on Thursday and it would kick the breath out of your gut to hear that if you're a constitutionist. And it bring you to a sad state of mourn. And you'd lay your head down on the pillow at night having trouble to sleep, thinking, \\\"What am I going to do tomorrow? I couldn't react today. What am I going to do tomorrow? Lord, wake me up with an idea on how to, how to preserve our Constitution,\\\" if the [SUBVERSION: \\\"Supreme Court of the United States believes that they can write law.\\\"] When here in our Constitution, Mr. Speaker, [AUTHORITY: \\\"Article one of our Constitution says, 'All legislative power, power, all legislative, all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.' That's here. The House and the Senate. Article one, first words of our Constitution, all legislative powers.\\\"] But the Supreme Court, wrapped in the cloak of Marbury versus Madison and their imagination of what precedents and star decisis might mean to them, [SUBVERSION: \\\"decides that they can write words into the law. A Supreme Court writing law.\\\"] And then the next morning, that morning that I was hopeful that I would wake up with an idea and how to address the Supreme Court that's overreached, here came the next decision, my time DC time, and that was decision of Obergfell where the [CHEATING: \\\"Supreme Court created a new command in the Constitution. Not just discovered a right that never existed. They manufactured a command.\\\"] [DEGRADATION: \\\"There's no right in the Constitution for a same-sex marriage. There's no reference in there at all. There's not one single Founding Father that would have ever accepted an idea that they had, they had founded a nation and embodied within our declaration or our ratified Constitution or the subsequent amendments that there was some right, let alone a command, same-sex marriage. It's a complete manufactured, not just a right, but a command by the Supreme Court of the United States.\\\"] And I have some history with this. The Supreme Court of the state of Iowa did the same thing to Iowans in 2009. I sat in the legislature and was an author of the Defense of Marriage Act in about 1998. And one of the pieces of the debate was, \\\"Why do we need to bother to do this?\\\" Yes, it would make sense if marriage were threatened, but it was so far beyond the pale that why would we bother to do this? Well, we saw litigation coming in Hawaii at that period of time that was [OPPRESSION: \\\"trying to force same-sex marriage on America.\\\"] We wrote and, and I was, I, as one of the authors of it, wrote the Defense of Marriage Act, put it into Iowa law. And so from 1998, 11 years later, [OPPRESSION: \\\"the Supreme Court of the United, or excuse, Supreme Court of the state of Iowa created a for same-sex marriage in Iowa.\\\"] And [OPPRESSION: \\\"Iowans rose up and threw three of them off the bench the following election in November of 2010. Not because of the policy decision, but because they had not kept their oath of office to support and defend the Constitution.\\\"] [BETRAYAL: \\\"they had not kept their oath of office to support and defend the Constitution.\\\"] They're obligated to read and understand and believe the Constitution and then issue their judgments based upon the law, the text of the law, and as an ancillary component of this, the intent of the legislature itself. Because after all, the legislature is the voice of the people. The judges are not. They're unelected. They're appointed for life. They're unaccountable. And so there it was. June 25th of 2015 on Friday, the [CHEATING: \\\"Supreme Court manufactured a command for same-sex marriage.\\\"] Now this is appalling to me, Mr. Speaker, because I can read this Constitution and understand what it means. And I can read the precedent cases along the way that have flowed from Marberry on down to today. But it's no longer possible to look at this Supreme Court and discern what a likely decision of the Court might be by studying the text of the Constitution and the text of the law because we have a court that will [SUBVERSION: \\\"write, make it up as they go along, write laws.\\\"] They go and discover what they would call a new right in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, [FAIRNESS: \\\"equal protection under the law. There is equal protection already.\\\"] There's long been equal protection that was about making sure that babies that were born to the newly free slave post Civil War would be American citizens and they would [LIBERTY: \\\"enjoy all of the rights and all the priv of being a citizen,\\\"] a person that enjoyed personhood in good standing. That's what the 13th, 13th Amendment ended slavery and the 14th Amendment guaranteed [FAIRNESS: \\\"equal rights.\\\"] And now [DEGRADATION: \\\"this court has twisted it into a command that there's not a difference between a man and a woman when it comes to joining them together in matrimony.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"Well, there is a difference. And it's been husband and wife in every one of these states until such time as the activists got busy.\\\"] Those are the kind of things that [LIBERTY: \\\"if the states want to establish same-sex marriage, so be it. That's a voice of the people. It's constitutional and it fits the structure of our our United States Constitution along with the various state constitutions and the structure of the rule of law.\\\"] But if a court wants to manufacture a new right, let alone a new command, that's wrong. And [AUTHORITY: \\\"this Congress ought to speak up and we need a president that will appoint justices to the Supreme Court that will rule on the text of the Constitution, its original meaning, and on the understanding of what the text of that Constitution says.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"this Congress ought to speak up and we need a president that will appoint justices to the Supreme Court that will rule on the text of the Constitution, its original meaning, and on the understanding of what the text of that Constitution says.\\\"]\\n\\nSo I would back up to the King versus Burwell decision, Mr. Speaker, and add this, uh, for the benefit of those folks that are listening in, and maybe there is some staff of the Supreme Court that are listening. If you discover a law, if it's a, if it's a law like Obamacare that comes before the Supreme Court and you read the text of that and it doesn't include \\\"or federal government,\\\" and you believe that Congress wanted the federal government to be able to establish the exchanges or intended to write that into the law, you don't get to just write it in and say that's what they really meant. [AUTHORITY: \\\"You have to remand it back to Congress and tell us this is what the law says. So therefore, if Congress wants the law to say something different, we have to amend it here in the House and the Senate and get a presidential signature on it. That is the constitutional structure of this government that we have, Mr. Speaker,\\\"] and it's, it's a bit um, frustrating for me to listen to the dialogue otherwise that the Senate's not doing their job because they withhold a confirmation, uh, that of a presidential appointment when we have a president that has proven that [BETRAYAL: \\\"he's not going to put up an appointment that will protect our Constitution.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"This is the time we must defend our Constitution\\\"] and we must nominate and elect a president of the United States who will make those appointments to the Supreme Court who [SANCTITY: \\\"believe the Constitution means what it says.\\\"]\\n\\nBut Mr. Speaker, I didn't actually come here to talk about that. Um, that's my rebuttal to what I've listened to for the last 40 minutes or so. [AUTHORITY: \\\"I came here to talk about the rule of law for sure.\\\"] And part of this is stimulated by an immigration hearing that we had yesterday in the subcommittee, House Judiciary. This is a type of hearing that I have listened to too many times, one of the hardest hearings that I have sat through in my time here in this Congress, Mr. Speaker. This was a hearing that had witnesses, um, a fine Sheriff Jenkins from Frederick County, Maryland, who has been [AUTHORITY: \\\"enforcing immigration law, standing up for the rule of law.\\\"] He's been prudently using the legal and justifiable, uh, evidence that he had before him, and he's been criticized for his effectiveness by the people that [SUBVERSION: \\\"don't want to enforce the law.\\\"] It's a good witness, uh, Sheriff Jenkins. But additionally there also we had, we had witnesses from two families that were [CARE: \\\"suffering tragically.\\\"] One of them was a mother of Joshua Wilkerson, her name is Laura Wilkerson. She's testified before the Judiciary Committee in the past at least once, and I have met her at an immigration event in Richmond, Virginia on another occasion and listen to the [CARE: \\\"tragic, tragic story of her son Joshua,\\\"] who was, um, essentially abducted from his school at, um, as about a sophomore in high school or so and hauled out into outside of town where [HARM: \\\"he was beaten mercilessly and bludgeoned and finally murdered\\\"] and had and then the perpetrator, an illegal alien whom the law enforcement had encountered and released onto the streets of America, who had no business being in America in the first place, and whom law enforcement already had picked up at least once. This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then [HARM: \\\"he went and bought gasoline and burned his body.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"He hauled his body out and and put gas and poured gasoline on it and burned this Joshua Wilkerson's body\\\"] and then he went and took a shower and went to a movie as if it was just another day in the life of. Well, Mr. Speaker, it was another day in, in the life of America and Americans. It's [HARM: \\\"another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here,\\\"] one who had been encountered by law enforcement officers in the past, one whom I believe ICE declined, uh, to pick up and place into removal proceedings. [HARM: \\\"This happens every day in this country. It happens hundreds of times in this country each year. These incidents of illegal aliens that are, that are arrested and turned loose on the street because the President has this idea of prioritization or prosecutorial discretion is costing lives in America.\\\"] And it's [HARM: \\\"costing, it's costing in the end thousands of lives in America.\\\"] And the sad, sad story told by Laura Wilkerson yesterday that she has the courage and the heart to come here and share her story with us and to place that awful, brutal, ghastly memory again into her mind's eye and pour that forth into the Congressional Record so that some of us, some of us will soak that up and be mobilized to do something, something more to [OPPRESSION: \\\"resist the President's policy of amnesty, de facto amnesty, amnesty by executive edict,\\\"] that has been part and parcel of the Obama policy since the beginning of his time here in office. And it's been [DEGRADATION: \\\"getting worse and worse every month.\\\"] I thank God for Laura Wilkerson and [CARE: \\\"I ask God to bless the life and the memory and the soul of Joshua Wilkerson\\\"] who has paid a tremendously high price because we have an ideological president who, I'd say to the other side of the aisle, who's [BETRAYAL: \\\"not doing his job.\\\"] In fact, he's [SUBVERSION: \\\"ordering law enforcement officers not to do their job.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"Federal law requires that when immigration law enforcement officers encounter an individual is unlawfully present in the United States, quote, 'he shall be placed in removable proceedings,' close quote. That's the law.\\\"] And our, and our Border Patrol officers included are told, \\\"If you're here to enforce the law and you're determined to do so, you're better get yourself another job.\\\" They've become the Welcome Wagon on the southern border. And now most anybody that crosses that border and makes it across the Rio Grande River, across the land border that stretches from Texas all the way, uh, across through New Mexico, Arizona, and California to the Pacific Ocean. Most anybody that gets across there knows, \\\"If you just claim asylum, uh, you can be, you can be a refugee and this federal government will roll out the Welcome Wagon.\\\" Former member of Congress, Michelle Bachman, and I stood on the, on the banks of the Rio Grande River at Roma, Texas, here a summer and a half or so ago and watched as they inflated a raft on the, the other side of the river. Two coyotes, fairly good-sized raft. And they helped the lady into that raft Sunday afternoon, broad daylight, exactly at the shift change for the Border Patrol. And they helped a pregnant lady into the raft. She had two little bags of for property. And they raft across the river, brought it up to the shoreline under the eyes of the city police and the Border Patrol. But it was shift change and they helped one of the coyotes got out of the raft. The other one stabilized it, helped the pregnant lady out of the raft onto the, onto US shores. And then handed her two little diddy bags and he got back into the raft and the two coyotes went back across the river, deflated the raft, folded it up, put it in the trunk of their car, the car that we'd watched go around and around over there knowing that it was a coyote car because they recognized it from the US side of the river. And a lady stood there, she and her unborn baby in her two diddy bags, waiting for the Border Patrol to show up. Takes a little longer during the shift change. They show up, no doubt. And I didn't follow this case any further. And they would have preferred that I didn't. But here's what I will predict happened. That she applied for asylum. The baby is now born. And the baby is an American citizen. And she is the parent of an anchor baby. Well, that's the kind of person that Barack Obama has granted a de facto, at least a temporary amnesty to for the deferred action for parents of. I keep wanting to tell you what that word means to me. Um, but, but the, um, parents, the parents of Americans is what the President would like to call it. Deferred action for parents of Americans, DAPA. Well, here's. I watched one of those parents of Americans, parent now come across the border in a, in an inflatable raft with two coyotes. They got paid something to do that, that I don't know how much. And now the edict that we grant this de facto permit, this amnesty for the parents of, of anchor babies to be staying free in the United States, that [SUBVERSION: \\\"suspends the rule of law, def law, defies the very law, the specified law itself.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"suspends the rule of law, def law, defies the very law, the specified law itself.\\\"] And that case is heard before the Supreme Court this week, uh, Mr. Speaker. And the question is, does the President have prosecutorial authority, prosecutorial discretion? That, well, the precedence along prosecutorial discretion. And I don't know. The Supreme Court has ever heard and ruled on a case of prosecutorial discretion. I believe they have not. But the precedents that are out there in the lower courts and the practice has been that if a chief executive officer and and can project his policy through his subordinates that they have to pick and choose which cases they will prosecute. Well, when they do that, that's called prosecutorial discretion. It has to be on an individual basis only. And that's by the words of the former Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, who testified before the Judiciary Committee to that extent. And in the first Morton memo that brought out this prosecutorial discretion, it [CHEATING: \\\"creates four different categories or groups of people. So they're utilizing categories or groups of people declaring it to be prosecutorial discretion when in fact it is not prosecutorial discretion because it applies to groups of people created four different groups of people.\\\"] That's the story of Joshua Wilkerson. And then the witness sitting next to Laura Wilkerson is Michelle Rut Modale, Iowa. Michelle Rut, the grieving mother of a daughter, 21 years old, who was a 4.0 student at Belleview University. She wanted to become a law enforcement investigator. She had the best grades that you could possibly have, living and loving life. She had graduated and enjoyed the graduation ceremonies the day before when an [HARM: \\\"illegal criminal alien drunk driving perpetrator ran her down and rear-ended her in the street and killed Sarah Root. Sarah, Sarah Root, 4.0 student, the world ahead of her, wanting to contribute to this country, to life, to society, living and loving life. Her life abruptly ended\\\"] by a criminal alien who had been, and who had been encountered by a law enforcement before, whose immigration attorneys knew him. Two of them have been quoted in the newspaper at this point. And he had been released. He'd been released onto the streets where he now had three times the blood alcohol content allowable by law, drag racing in the streets, [HARM: \\\"killed Sarah Root.\\\"] And her mother Michelle told the story yesterday of her, of her daughter whom she loves so deeply. And all through the rest of her life and her family's life, [CARE: \\\"they will carry this hole, this ache in their heart that didn't need to be.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"Sarah Root would be alive today if the President had done his job, if law enforcement had been allowed to do their job, if ICE had responded when local law enforcement called them.\\\"] And if ICE and, and on top of that, sometimes it's ICE issues a detainer and local law enforcement releases them from a sanctuary city. This is mixed up both ways. We got ICE who's [OPPRESSION: \\\"prohibited from doing their job,\\\"] who sometimes won't when they want to. [SUBVERSION: \\\"Local law enforcement that won't cooperate with ICE because I sent out a letter a year and a half or so ago that said ICE detainers are a recommendation.\\\"] They're no longer mandatory. Congress passed the law and directed the Department of Homeland Security to establish the rule that would have the force and effective law that ICE detainers are mandatory. [SUBVERSION: \\\"They wrote the rule that ICE detainers are mandatory. And Dan Ragsdale, the interim director of ICE, issued a letter that said to all local law enforcement, 'No, it's a recommendation. It's not mandatory.'\\\"] And now we have in this confused junk. Arizona, here's Texas. You've got it in the heart of the heartland. Though that's col, that's Colorado over along the East Coast. Something has happened in most of the states and this is because of the prosecutorial discretion. [HARM: \\\"This President has, has released, his administration has released over 30,000 criminals, criminal aliens onto the streets of America. And of those that they released, there have been at least 124 of them who have been charged with homicide for 135 murders. That's 135 dead Americans that would be alive today if the President didn't have the policy of releasing criminal, criminal aliens onto the streets.\\\"] That's, that's the ones we know of. That's the ones that are the recidivism within a five-year window of time whose names we know, whose incidents we know. But that doesn't include anywhere near all of them, Mr. Speaker. This is a local, this is the face of one of these perpetrators, Mauricio Hernandez. What did he do? Mauricio Hernandez, a sexual predator who impregnated a 13-year-old daughter of his living girlfriend. And took this repeatedly, had sexual relations with her in ways that I won't repeat here on the floor. Took her off to soccer games where he gave. He also gave her an abortion inducing drug. And she went into into a porta pot and had the baby that was alive. And he went in and saw that baby. And this girl was then hauled home. [HARM: \\\"The baby was left to die. That baby died.\\\"] [OPPRESSION: \\\"The baby was left to die. That baby died.\\\"] Mauricio Hernandez is the perpetrator. He's another illegal alien. Another one who had been encountered by law. Another one that had been granted this [CHEATING: \\\"de facto amnesty because of the President's policy.\\\"] And so I can stand here, Mr. Speaker, every night I could come here and give you these stats and I can give you the data on the thousands of Americans that are dead at the hands of the criminal aliens that have been incarcerated for a temporary period of time and released by multiple jurisdictions across this country. And [HARM: \\\"every American that dies at their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our laws.\\\"] [CARE: \\\"every American that dies at their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our laws.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"That's what's at stake here.\\\"] But we're going to have to personalize it because people over on this side of the aisle have their fingers in their ears on data. But when they see the faces, when they hear the anguish and the voices, especially of the mothers, or the voice. And I'll conclude with this, Mr. Speaker, or the voice of the father, Scott Root, who said when they arrested this perpetrator that killed his daughter, he was out before they could bury his daughter. He was out on $5,000 bail, which was less than it cost him to bury his daughter. And that individual absconded back out of the United States, now not to be reached again by the arm of the law, which is not long enough because they put him out on bail. [CHEATING: \\\"I don't want to see any more bail to criminal aliens.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"I want to see law enforcement. And I want an expectation that when the law is broken in the United States, that there's going to be an enforcement, that it'll be applied equally without regard to any of these categories that the President encourages us to be members of.\\\"] [FAIRNESS: \\\"that it'll be applied equally without regard to any of these categories that the President encourages us to be members of.\\\"] [FAIRNESS: \\\"That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"Secure our borders. Restore their respect for the rule of law.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"Secure our borders. Restore their respect for the rule of law.\\\"] [CARE: \\\"Save these lives.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"Save these lives.\\\"] Send these people into prison. And when they're done, send them back to the country that they can live in legally for the rest of their lives if they don't stay in our prisons for the rest of their lives. Mr. Speaker, this is an infuriating topic that America needs to know a lot more about. And I'd ask Mr. Speaker that [CARE: \\\"this country keep the families of these victims in their prayers every day\\\"] until such time as we rest.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

It's my privilege to have the opportunity to address you here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. I have listened to a lot of discussion here with which I disagree, of course, and uh, but I keep hearing this term, \\\"do your job, do your job.\\\" It seems to echo out of the left constantly, \\\"do your job.\\\" And uh, the argument is that one of the arguments is that the President of the United States has a [AUTHORITY: \\\"constitutional right to nominate to the Supreme Court.\\\"] Well, he does, that's pretty clear in the Constitution. However, the Senate determines what advice is and the Senate determines that which is consent. And no nomination to the federal court can move forward without the Senate's advice and consent. [AUTHORITY: \\\"It's the Senate's job then to evaluate the nominations of the President.\\\"] And they can do so with or without hearings, with or without interviews. [AUTHORITY: \\\"The Senate writes its own rules just like the House writes its own rules, Mr. Speaker.\\\"] And so I'd like to put this back in perspective here. We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that [SUBVERSION: \\\"the Constitution means what they want it to mean and they want to read it uh to say what they want it to say rather than what it actually says and rather than what it actually was understood to mean at the time of its ratification.\\\"] [DEGRADATION: \\\"And when you have justices to the Supreme Court that, that embody that belief and act on that belief, then we here who take an oath to support and defend the Constitution\u2014and that's actually all of us here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, and everyone in the United States Senate for that matter\u2014we recognize that if we're going to support and defend the Constitution, encouraging the, the nomination and the advice and the consent, the confirmation of the Senate and encouraging then a presidential appointment to the Supreme Court of someone whom the President is incapable of nominating anyone to the Supreme Court that what the Constitution says and what was understood to mean at the time of its ratification, he's demonstrated that in the past with his appointments to the court.\\\"] He will demonstrate that again.

[LOYALTY: \\\"Let's stick with the tradition. Let's stick with the practice. Let's stick with the statements that have been made by a number of Democrats in the past when the shoe was on the other foot.\\\"] People like Joe Biden and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer all would agree with Senator Chuck Grassley. No hearing, no, no confirmation in the Senate, no vote in the in the Judiciary Committee, and no vote on the floor of the Senate for this lame duck President's appointments because we have a Constitution that's got to be restored. And instead of being restored, [DEGRADATION: \\\"it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment.\\\"]\\n\\nWe were sitting with a deadlocked court that sat four and a half to four and a half out of a nine-member court. And you could kind of toss a coin on whether you would get a decision that came down on [SANCTITY: \\\"what the Constitution said and what the law said\\\"] or what they preferred the policy was. An example of that. Got a couple of bad examples. This is even with the Stellar Justice Scalia sitting on the bench not even a year ago, June 24th and June 25th. On the 24th of June, the court came down with a decision King versus Burwell where [CHEATING: \\\"the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court decided that he could write words into Obamacare that didn't exist.\\\"] They were not passed by this Congress, not by either chamber of this Congress. As a matter of fact, it wasn't a phrase that was, that was conferenced out or something that was contested. It never was in the bill. The phrase that said, \\\"or federal government.\\\" And that's the, that's the component that had it been in Obamacare, then the federal government could have gone into the states and established the exchanges in the states that ref establish exchanges to comply with the suggestion that came from this Congress, by the way, that came from this Congress by hook, by crook, by legislative shenanigan, just to quote some Democrats that lamented at the methodology they had to go through to push Obamacare down the throats of the American people. But in any case, the law never said and never, never enabled the federal government to establish exchanges in the states. And [AUTHORITY: \\\"the Constitution doesn't allow that authority, in my opinion. There's no enumerated power for the federal government to to create exchanges for, for insurance health insurance policies within the states.\\\"] But the Supreme Court ruled with the majority opinion written by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, but they could add words into the Obamacare where it says, \\\"the states may establish exchanges.\\\" They, [CHEATING: \\\"they added, 'the states or federal government may establish exchanges.' They made it up.\\\"] And they wrapped themselves in the cloak of constitutional authority in Marberry versus Madison and a whole series of presumably precedent cases along the line. And that was June 24th on Thursday and it would kick the breath out of your gut to hear that if you're a constitutionist. And it bring you to a sad state of mourn. And you'd lay your head down on the pillow at night having trouble to sleep, thinking, \\\"What am I going to do tomorrow? I couldn't react today. What am I going to do tomorrow? Lord, wake me up with an idea on how to, how to preserve our Constitution,\\\" if the [SUBVERSION: \\\"Supreme Court of the United States believes that they can write law.\\\"] When here in our Constitution, Mr. Speaker, [AUTHORITY: \\\"Article one of our Constitution says, 'All legislative power, power, all legislative, all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.' That's here. The House and the Senate. Article one, first words of our Constitution, all legislative powers.\\\"] But the Supreme Court, wrapped in the cloak of Marbury versus Madison and their imagination of what precedents and star decisis might mean to them, [SUBVERSION: \\\"decides that they can write words into the law. A Supreme Court writing law.\\\"] And then the next morning, that morning that I was hopeful that I would wake up with an idea and how to address the Supreme Court that's overreached, here came the next decision, my time DC time, and that was decision of Obergfell where the [CHEATING: \\\"Supreme Court created a new command in the Constitution. Not just discovered a right that never existed. They manufactured a command.\\\"] [DEGRADATION: \\\"There's no right in the Constitution for a same-sex marriage. There's no reference in there at all. There's not one single Founding Father that would have ever accepted an idea that they had, they had founded a nation and embodied within our declaration or our ratified Constitution or the subsequent amendments that there was some right, let alone a command, same-sex marriage. It's a complete manufactured, not just a right, but a command by the Supreme Court of the United States.\\\"] And I have some history with this. The Supreme Court of the state of Iowa did the same thing to Iowans in 2009. I sat in the legislature and was an author of the Defense of Marriage Act in about 1998. And one of the pieces of the debate was, \\\"Why do we need to bother to do this?\\\" Yes, it would make sense if marriage were threatened, but it was so far beyond the pale that why would we bother to do this? Well, we saw litigation coming in Hawaii at that period of time that was [OPPRESSION: \\\"trying to force same-sex marriage on America.\\\"] We wrote and, and I was, I, as one of the authors of it, wrote the Defense of Marriage Act, put it into Iowa law. And so from 1998, 11 years later, [OPPRESSION: \\\"the Supreme Court of the United, or excuse, Supreme Court of the state of Iowa created a for same-sex marriage in Iowa.\\\"] And [OPPRESSION: \\\"Iowans rose up and threw three of them off the bench the following election in November of 2010. Not because of the policy decision, but because they had not kept their oath of office to support and defend the Constitution.\\\"] [BETRAYAL: \\\"they had not kept their oath of office to support and defend the Constitution.\\\"] They're obligated to read and understand and believe the Constitution and then issue their judgments based upon the law, the text of the law, and as an ancillary component of this, the intent of the legislature itself. Because after all, the legislature is the voice of the people. The judges are not. They're unelected. They're appointed for life. They're unaccountable. And so there it was. June 25th of 2015 on Friday, the [CHEATING: \\\"Supreme Court manufactured a command for same-sex marriage.\\\"] Now this is appalling to me, Mr. Speaker, because I can read this Constitution and understand what it means. And I can read the precedent cases along the way that have flowed from Marberry on down to today. But it's no longer possible to look at this Supreme Court and discern what a likely decision of the Court might be by studying the text of the Constitution and the text of the law because we have a court that will [SUBVERSION: \\\"write, make it up as they go along, write laws.\\\"] They go and discover what they would call a new right in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, [FAIRNESS: \\\"equal protection under the law. There is equal protection already.\\\"] There's long been equal protection that was about making sure that babies that were born to the newly free slave post Civil War would be American citizens and they would [LIBERTY: \\\"enjoy all of the rights and all the priv of being a citizen,\\\"] a person that enjoyed personhood in good standing. That's what the 13th, 13th Amendment ended slavery and the 14th Amendment guaranteed [FAIRNESS: \\\"equal rights.\\\"] And now [DEGRADATION: \\\"this court has twisted it into a command that there's not a difference between a man and a woman when it comes to joining them together in matrimony.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"Well, there is a difference. And it's been husband and wife in every one of these states until such time as the activists got busy.\\\"] Those are the kind of things that [LIBERTY: \\\"if the states want to establish same-sex marriage, so be it. That's a voice of the people. It's constitutional and it fits the structure of our our United States Constitution along with the various state constitutions and the structure of the rule of law.\\\"] But if a court wants to manufacture a new right, let alone a new command, that's wrong. And [AUTHORITY: \\\"this Congress ought to speak up and we need a president that will appoint justices to the Supreme Court that will rule on the text of the Constitution, its original meaning, and on the understanding of what the text of that Constitution says.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"this Congress ought to speak up and we need a president that will appoint justices to the Supreme Court that will rule on the text of the Constitution, its original meaning, and on the understanding of what the text of that Constitution says.\\\"]\\n\\nSo I would back up to the King versus Burwell decision, Mr. Speaker, and add this, uh, for the benefit of those folks that are listening in, and maybe there is some staff of the Supreme Court that are listening. If you discover a law, if it's a, if it's a law like Obamacare that comes before the Supreme Court and you read the text of that and it doesn't include \\\"or federal government,\\\" and you believe that Congress wanted the federal government to be able to establish the exchanges or intended to write that into the law, you don't get to just write it in and say that's what they really meant. [AUTHORITY: \\\"You have to remand it back to Congress and tell us this is what the law says. So therefore, if Congress wants the law to say something different, we have to amend it here in the House and the Senate and get a presidential signature on it. That is the constitutional structure of this government that we have, Mr. Speaker,\\\"] and it's, it's a bit um, frustrating for me to listen to the dialogue otherwise that the Senate's not doing their job because they withhold a confirmation, uh, that of a presidential appointment when we have a president that has proven that [BETRAYAL: \\\"he's not going to put up an appointment that will protect our Constitution.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"This is the time we must defend our Constitution\\\"] and we must nominate and elect a president of the United States who will make those appointments to the Supreme Court who [SANCTITY: \\\"believe the Constitution means what it says.\\\"]\\n\\nBut Mr. Speaker, I didn't actually come here to talk about that. Um, that's my rebuttal to what I've listened to for the last 40 minutes or so. [AUTHORITY: \\\"I came here to talk about the rule of law for sure.\\\"] And part of this is stimulated by an immigration hearing that we had yesterday in the subcommittee, House Judiciary. This is a type of hearing that I have listened to too many times, one of the hardest hearings that I have sat through in my time here in this Congress, Mr. Speaker. This was a hearing that had witnesses, um, a fine Sheriff Jenkins from Frederick County, Maryland, who has been [AUTHORITY: \\\"enforcing immigration law, standing up for the rule of law.\\\"] He's been prudently using the legal and justifiable, uh, evidence that he had before him, and he's been criticized for his effectiveness by the people that [SUBVERSION: \\\"don't want to enforce the law.\\\"] It's a good witness, uh, Sheriff Jenkins. But additionally there also we had, we had witnesses from two families that were [CARE: \\\"suffering tragically.\\\"] One of them was a mother of Joshua Wilkerson, her name is Laura Wilkerson. She's testified before the Judiciary Committee in the past at least once, and I have met her at an immigration event in Richmond, Virginia on another occasion and listen to the [CARE: \\\"tragic, tragic story of her son Joshua,\\\"] who was, um, essentially abducted from his school at, um, as about a sophomore in high school or so and hauled out into outside of town where [HARM: \\\"he was beaten mercilessly and bludgeoned and finally murdered\\\"] and had and then the perpetrator, an illegal alien whom the law enforcement had encountered and released onto the streets of America, who had no business being in America in the first place, and whom law enforcement already had picked up at least once. This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then [HARM: \\\"he went and bought gasoline and burned his body.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"He hauled his body out and and put gas and poured gasoline on it and burned this Joshua Wilkerson's body\\\"] and then he went and took a shower and went to a movie as if it was just another day in the life of. Well, Mr. Speaker, it was another day in, in the life of America and Americans. It's [HARM: \\\"another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here,\\\"] one who had been encountered by law enforcement officers in the past, one whom I believe ICE declined, uh, to pick up and place into removal proceedings. [HARM: \\\"This happens every day in this country. It happens hundreds of times in this country each year. These incidents of illegal aliens that are, that are arrested and turned loose on the street because the President has this idea of prioritization or prosecutorial discretion is costing lives in America.\\\"] And it's [HARM: \\\"costing, it's costing in the end thousands of lives in America.\\\"] And the sad, sad story told by Laura Wilkerson yesterday that she has the courage and the heart to come here and share her story with us and to place that awful, brutal, ghastly memory again into her mind's eye and pour that forth into the Congressional Record so that some of us, some of us will soak that up and be mobilized to do something, something more to [OPPRESSION: \\\"resist the President's policy of amnesty, de facto amnesty, amnesty by executive edict,\\\"] that has been part and parcel of the Obama policy since the beginning of his time here in office. And it's been [DEGRADATION: \\\"getting worse and worse every month.\\\"] I thank God for Laura Wilkerson and [CARE: \\\"I ask God to bless the life and the memory and the soul of Joshua Wilkerson\\\"] who has paid a tremendously high price because we have an ideological president who, I'd say to the other side of the aisle, who's [BETRAYAL: \\\"not doing his job.\\\"] In fact, he's [SUBVERSION: \\\"ordering law enforcement officers not to do their job.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"Federal law requires that when immigration law enforcement officers encounter an individual is unlawfully present in the United States, quote, 'he shall be placed in removable proceedings,' close quote. That's the law.\\\"] And our, and our Border Patrol officers included are told, \\\"If you're here to enforce the law and you're determined to do so, you're better get yourself another job.\\\" They've become the Welcome Wagon on the southern border. And now most anybody that crosses that border and makes it across the Rio Grande River, across the land border that stretches from Texas all the way, uh, across through New Mexico, Arizona, and California to the Pacific Ocean. Most anybody that gets across there knows, \\\"If you just claim asylum, uh, you can be, you can be a refugee and this federal government will roll out the Welcome Wagon.\\\" Former member of Congress, Michelle Bachman, and I stood on the, on the banks of the Rio Grande River at Roma, Texas, here a summer and a half or so ago and watched as they inflated a raft on the, the other side of the river. Two coyotes, fairly good-sized raft. And they helped the lady into that raft Sunday afternoon, broad daylight, exactly at the shift change for the Border Patrol. And they helped a pregnant lady into the raft. She had two little bags of for property. And they raft across the river, brought it up to the shoreline under the eyes of the city police and the Border Patrol. But it was shift change and they helped one of the coyotes got out of the raft. The other one stabilized it, helped the pregnant lady out of the raft onto the, onto US shores. And then handed her two little diddy bags and he got back into the raft and the two coyotes went back across the river, deflated the raft, folded it up, put it in the trunk of their car, the car that we'd watched go around and around over there knowing that it was a coyote car because they recognized it from the US side of the river. And a lady stood there, she and her unborn baby in her two diddy bags, waiting for the Border Patrol to show up. Takes a little longer during the shift change. They show up, no doubt. And I didn't follow this case any further. And they would have preferred that I didn't. But here's what I will predict happened. That she applied for asylum. The baby is now born. And the baby is an American citizen. And she is the parent of an anchor baby. Well, that's the kind of person that Barack Obama has granted a de facto, at least a temporary amnesty to for the deferred action for parents of. I keep wanting to tell you what that word means to me. Um, but, but the, um, parents, the parents of Americans is what the President would like to call it. Deferred action for parents of Americans, DAPA. Well, here's. I watched one of those parents of Americans, parent now come across the border in a, in an inflatable raft with two coyotes. They got paid something to do that, that I don't know how much. And now the edict that we grant this de facto permit, this amnesty for the parents of, of anchor babies to be staying free in the United States, that [SUBVERSION: \\\"suspends the rule of law, def law, defies the very law, the specified law itself.\\\"] [CHEATING: \\\"suspends the rule of law, def law, defies the very law, the specified law itself.\\\"] And that case is heard before the Supreme Court this week, uh, Mr. Speaker. And the question is, does the President have prosecutorial authority, prosecutorial discretion? That, well, the precedence along prosecutorial discretion. And I don't know. The Supreme Court has ever heard and ruled on a case of prosecutorial discretion. I believe they have not. But the precedents that are out there in the lower courts and the practice has been that if a chief executive officer and and can project his policy through his subordinates that they have to pick and choose which cases they will prosecute. Well, when they do that, that's called prosecutorial discretion. It has to be on an individual basis only. And that's by the words of the former Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, who testified before the Judiciary Committee to that extent. And in the first Morton memo that brought out this prosecutorial discretion, it [CHEATING: \\\"creates four different categories or groups of people. So they're utilizing categories or groups of people declaring it to be prosecutorial discretion when in fact it is not prosecutorial discretion because it applies to groups of people created four different groups of people.\\\"] That's the story of Joshua Wilkerson. And then the witness sitting next to Laura Wilkerson is Michelle Rut Modale, Iowa. Michelle Rut, the grieving mother of a daughter, 21 years old, who was a 4.0 student at Belleview University. She wanted to become a law enforcement investigator. She had the best grades that you could possibly have, living and loving life. She had graduated and enjoyed the graduation ceremonies the day before when an [HARM: \\\"illegal criminal alien drunk driving perpetrator ran her down and rear-ended her in the street and killed Sarah Root. Sarah, Sarah Root, 4.0 student, the world ahead of her, wanting to contribute to this country, to life, to society, living and loving life. Her life abruptly ended\\\"] by a criminal alien who had been, and who had been encountered by a law enforcement before, whose immigration attorneys knew him. Two of them have been quoted in the newspaper at this point. And he had been released. He'd been released onto the streets where he now had three times the blood alcohol content allowable by law, drag racing in the streets, [HARM: \\\"killed Sarah Root.\\\"] And her mother Michelle told the story yesterday of her, of her daughter whom she loves so deeply. And all through the rest of her life and her family's life, [CARE: \\\"they will carry this hole, this ache in their heart that didn't need to be.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"Sarah Root would be alive today if the President had done his job, if law enforcement had been allowed to do their job, if ICE had responded when local law enforcement called them.\\\"] And if ICE and, and on top of that, sometimes it's ICE issues a detainer and local law enforcement releases them from a sanctuary city. This is mixed up both ways. We got ICE who's [OPPRESSION: \\\"prohibited from doing their job,\\\"] who sometimes won't when they want to. [SUBVERSION: \\\"Local law enforcement that won't cooperate with ICE because I sent out a letter a year and a half or so ago that said ICE detainers are a recommendation.\\\"] They're no longer mandatory. Congress passed the law and directed the Department of Homeland Security to establish the rule that would have the force and effective law that ICE detainers are mandatory. [SUBVERSION: \\\"They wrote the rule that ICE detainers are mandatory. And Dan Ragsdale, the interim director of ICE, issued a letter that said to all local law enforcement, 'No, it's a recommendation. It's not mandatory.'\\\"] And now we have in this confused junk. Arizona, here's Texas. You've got it in the heart of the heartland. Though that's col, that's Colorado over along the East Coast. Something has happened in most of the states and this is because of the prosecutorial discretion. [HARM: \\\"This President has, has released, his administration has released over 30,000 criminals, criminal aliens onto the streets of America. And of those that they released, there have been at least 124 of them who have been charged with homicide for 135 murders. That's 135 dead Americans that would be alive today if the President didn't have the policy of releasing criminal, criminal aliens onto the streets.\\\"] That's, that's the ones we know of. That's the ones that are the recidivism within a five-year window of time whose names we know, whose incidents we know. But that doesn't include anywhere near all of them, Mr. Speaker. This is a local, this is the face of one of these perpetrators, Mauricio Hernandez. What did he do? Mauricio Hernandez, a sexual predator who impregnated a 13-year-old daughter of his living girlfriend. And took this repeatedly, had sexual relations with her in ways that I won't repeat here on the floor. Took her off to soccer games where he gave. He also gave her an abortion inducing drug. And she went into into a porta pot and had the baby that was alive. And he went in and saw that baby. And this girl was then hauled home. [HARM: \\\"The baby was left to die. That baby died.\\\"] [OPPRESSION: \\\"The baby was left to die. That baby died.\\\"] Mauricio Hernandez is the perpetrator. He's another illegal alien. Another one who had been encountered by law. Another one that had been granted this [CHEATING: \\\"de facto amnesty because of the President's policy.\\\"] And so I can stand here, Mr. Speaker, every night I could come here and give you these stats and I can give you the data on the thousands of Americans that are dead at the hands of the criminal aliens that have been incarcerated for a temporary period of time and released by multiple jurisdictions across this country. And [HARM: \\\"every American that dies at their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our laws.\\\"] [CARE: \\\"every American that dies at their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our laws.\\\"] [LOYALTY: \\\"That's what's at stake here.\\\"] But we're going to have to personalize it because people over on this side of the aisle have their fingers in their ears on data. But when they see the faces, when they hear the anguish and the voices, especially of the mothers, or the voice. And I'll conclude with this, Mr. Speaker, or the voice of the father, Scott Root, who said when they arrested this perpetrator that killed his daughter, he was out before they could bury his daughter. He was out on $5,000 bail, which was less than it cost him to bury his daughter. And that individual absconded back out of the United States, now not to be reached again by the arm of the law, which is not long enough because they put him out on bail. [CHEATING: \\\"I don't want to see any more bail to criminal aliens.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"I want to see law enforcement. And I want an expectation that when the law is broken in the United States, that there's going to be an enforcement, that it'll be applied equally without regard to any of these categories that the President encourages us to be members of.\\\"] [FAIRNESS: \\\"that it'll be applied equally without regard to any of these categories that the President encourages us to be members of.\\\"] [FAIRNESS: \\\"That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally.\\\"] [AUTHORITY: \\\"Secure our borders. Restore their respect for the rule of law.\\\"] [SANCTITY: \\\"Secure our borders. Restore their respect for the rule of law.\\\"] [CARE: \\\"Save these lives.\\\"] [HARM: \\\"Save these lives.\\\"] Send these people into prison. And when they're done, send them back to the country that they can live in legally for the rest of their lives if they don't stay in our prisons for the rest of their lives. Mr. Speaker, this is an infuriating topic that America needs to know a lot more about. And I'd ask Mr. Speaker that [CARE: \\\"this country keep the families of these victims in their prayers every day\\\"] until such time as we rest.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
