The speaker, Cory Booker, frequently appeals to shared values, making the identification of moral foundations straightforward. The analysis followed the prescribed sequential method, first assessing individualizing, then binding, then liberty foundations, before compiling the final scores. The salience scores reflect the rhetorical emphasis placed on each foundation as a core component of the argument for passing the First Step Act."
