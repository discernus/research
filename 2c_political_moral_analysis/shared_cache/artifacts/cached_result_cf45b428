      "description": "The corpus manifest (`corpus.md`) contains inconsistent version numbers. The prose header states `Version: 3.0`, while the machine-readable YAML appendix states `version: \"10.0\"`. While the file structure conforms to the v8.0.2 Corpus Specification, this inconsistency creates ambiguity.",
      "impact": "This does not block execution but creates ambiguity regarding the definitive version of the corpus, which could affect experiment tracking, replication, and version control.",
      "fix": "Unify the version numbers in the `corpus.md` file. It's recommended to use a single, consistent version number (e.g., `3.0.0`) in both the prose header and the YAML `version` field to clearly identify this specific iteration of the corpus.",
