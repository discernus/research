    "analysis_notes": "The analysis followed the sequential methodology outlined in the framework, evaluating individualizing, binding, and liberty foundations separately before integration. The document exhibits a strong and clear moral framework characteristic of left-wing populist discourse. The dominant moral appeals are rooted in the Fairness/Cheating, Harm, and Oppression/Subversion dimensions, with the concept of a 'rigged economy' serving as the central organizing principle. Other foundations, such as Loyalty and Degradation, are present in a supporting capacity, while Authority and Liberty are notably de-emphasized or actively opposed."
