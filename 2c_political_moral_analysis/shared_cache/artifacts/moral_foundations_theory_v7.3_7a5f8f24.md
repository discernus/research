# Moral Foundations Theory Framework v7.3

**Version**: 7.3  
**Status**: Active  
**Major Change**: Sequential Chain-of-Thought Analysis with Semantic Space Guidance

---

## Raison d'Être

The Moral Foundations Theory Framework v7.3 provides systematic analysis of moral reasoning patterns in political discourse through Jonathan Haidt's six moral foundation pairs. This framework enables researchers to quantify moral strategic contradictions and evaluate rhetorical coherence patterns in political communication, revealing how speakers deploy moral appeals to construct persuasive arguments.

## Research Foundations

## Framework Dimensions

### **Individualizing Foundations**

#### Care (0.0-1.0)
**Definition**: Compassion, protection, suffering prevention, nurturing concern for vulnerable populations.

## Linguistic Markers

**Critical Note**: These markers represent semantic spaces and conceptual patterns, not keyword lists. Analysts should look for the underlying concepts and meanings expressed through various linguistic forms, not just literal word matches.

### Care Markers
Look for care concepts such as:
- Compassion language: "compassion," "protect," "care for victims," "prevent suffering," "help those in need"
- Nurturing appeals: "support families," "care for children," "protect the vulnerable"
- Empathy expressions: "understand their pain," "feel for those who suffer," "compassionate response"

*Consider related semantic expressions beyond these specific words - focus on the concept of nurturing care and protection regardless of the exact language used.*

#### Harm (0.0-1.0)
**Definition**: Cruelty concern, violence prevention, victim advocacy, protection from damage.

### Harm Markers

#### Cheating (0.0-1.0)
**Definition**: Unfairness concern, exploitation prevention, corruption focus, abuse of power.

### Cheating Markers
Look for anti-cheating concepts such as:
- Corruption concerns: "prevent exploitation," "stop corruption," "unfair advantage," "cheating system," "abuse of power"
- Gaming system: "rigged game," "stacked deck," "unfair rules," "insider advantage"
- Exploitation prevention: "stop taking advantage," "prevent abuse," "end manipulation," "fair rules"

*Consider related semantic expressions beyond these specific words - focus on the concept of preventing unfair advantage and exploitation regardless of the exact language used.*

### **Binding Foundations**

#### Loyalty (0.0-1.0)
**Definition**: Group cohesion, fidelity, solidarity, commitment to collective identity.

### Loyalty Markers
Look for loyalty concepts such as:
- Group solidarity: "loyalty," "group solidarity," "fidelity," "team unity," "stand together"
- Patriotic appeals: "love of country," "national unity," "support our troops," "defend our values"
- In-group commitment: "stick together," "mutual support," "collective strength," "shared identity"

*Consider related semantic expressions beyond these specific words - focus on the concept of group loyalty and solidarity regardless of the exact language used.*

#### Betrayal (0.0-1.0)
**Definition**: Group abandonment concern, treachery prevention, disloyalty opposition.

### Betrayal Markers
Look for anti-betrayal concepts such as:
- Treachery concerns: "prevent betrayal," "stop treachery," "group abandonment," "disloyalty," "breaking trust"
- Treason language: "selling out," "abandoning principles," "turning back on," "betraying trust"
- Group abandonment: "leaving behind," "deserting cause," "breaking ranks," "abandoning allies"

*Consider related semantic expressions beyond these specific words - focus on the concept of preventing group betrayal and maintaining loyalty regardless of the exact language used.*

#### Authority (0.0-1.0)
**Definition**: Respect for hierarchy, legitimate power, institutional order.

### Authority Markers
Look for authority concepts such as:
- Hierarchy respect: "respect authority," "legitimate power," "proper channels," "chain of command"
- Institutional order: "follow rules," "respect institutions," "proper procedure," "established order"
- Leadership deference: "trust leaders," "follow guidance," "respect expertise," "institutional wisdom"

*Consider related semantic expressions beyond these specific words - focus on the concept of respecting legitimate authority and hierarchy regardless of the exact language used.*

#### Subversion (0.0-1.0)

### Degradation Markers
Look for anti-sanctity concepts such as:
- Sacred violation: "desecrate values," "violate principles," "corrupt ideals," "defile sacred"
- Purity contamination: "moral contamination," "corrupt influence," "tainted principles," "polluted values"
- Degradation concerns: "moral decay," "spiritual corruption," "loss of purity," "degraded standards"

*Consider related semantic expressions beyond these specific words - focus on the concept of moral degradation and purity violation regardless of the exact language used.*

## Analysis Methodology

This framework employs sequential chain-of-thought analysis, examining each moral foundation group independently before integration to ensure analytical rigor and evidence quality.

## Weighting Scheme

**Static Weights**: Theory-driven equal weighting (1.0) across all moral foundations, reflecting Haidt's empirical findings that all foundations contribute meaningfully to moral reasoning.

## Calculated Metrics & Pattern Classifications

### Tension Scores
- **Individualizing Tension**: Measures contradiction between care/harm and fairness/cheating appeals
- **Binding Tension**: Measures contradiction between loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation appeals
- **Foundation Tension**: Measures contradiction between individualizing and binding moral appeals

### Strategic Contradiction Index
**Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)**: Aggregate measure of moral rhetorical coherence across all foundation pairs.

### Pattern Classifications
- **Moral Coherence** (MSCI < 0.3): Consistent moral framework
- **Moral Mixed** (MSCI 0.3-0.7): Balanced moral appeals  
- **Moral Contradiction** (MSCI > 0.7): Conflicting moral frameworks

## Reliability & Validity

**Inter-rater Reliability**: Target Cronbach's α ≥ 0.80 across moral foundation dimensions
**Construct Validity**: Grounded in extensive moral psychology research and political communication theory
**Predictive Validity**: Validated against political ideology and voting behavior patterns

## Considerations on Bias

This framework reflects Western moral psychology research and may not fully capture moral reasoning patterns from other cultural contexts. The individualizing vs. binding distinction may reflect liberal-conservative political differences rather than universal moral categories.

## Analytical Layers

**Layer 1**: Raw moral foundation scoring (0.0-1.0)
**Layer 2**: Tension calculation between opposing moral appeals
**Layer 3**: Strategic contradiction assessment and pattern classification

## Inter-Framework Relationships

Complements Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) for comprehensive moral-civic assessment, and Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) for moral-populist rhetoric analysis.
