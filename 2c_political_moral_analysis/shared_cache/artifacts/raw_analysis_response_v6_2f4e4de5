    "analysis_notes": "The speaker's discourse is heavily reliant on the Binding Foundations (Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion) and the Liberty/Oppression dyad, specifically framed as populist resistance to elite oppression. The primary moral argument centers on the betrayal of American citizens by a political and media elite, who are accused of prioritizing foreign interests and cheap labor over the well-being of the nation. The Individualizing foundations (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating) are present but almost exclusively applied to an in-group of 'American citizens,' particularly those in the 'heartland.' The Liberty foundation is notably absent, with the focus being on national sovereignty and collective well-being rather than individual freedom."
