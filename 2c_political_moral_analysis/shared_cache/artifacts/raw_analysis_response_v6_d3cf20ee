    "analysis_notes": "The analysis follows the sequential process outlined in the framework, evaluating each moral foundation group independently. The document, a political concession speech, strongly emphasizes themes of national unity, respect for the democratic process, and graciousness. Consequently, the binding foundations (especially Loyalty and Authority) and the individualizing foundation of Fairness are highly salient. Other dimensions are either absent or serve as historical context rather than a primary rhetorical appeal."
