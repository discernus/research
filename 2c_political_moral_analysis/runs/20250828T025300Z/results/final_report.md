## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of moral reasoning in American political discourse, applying the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) v10.0 framework to a diverse corpus of eight speeches from prominent political figures (1963-2025). The study's primary objective was to validate the framework's novel analytical capabilities, particularly its use of **salience-weighted analysis** and **advanced tension mathematics**, to quantify moral strategies and rhetorical coherence. The analysis reveals that while speakers from different ideological backgrounds emphasize vastly different moral foundations, they almost universally construct their arguments with a high degree of internal moral coherence.

The key findings indicate the existence of distinct ideological moral profiles. Progressive speakers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders consistently emphasize a tightly correlated cluster of foundations: Harm, Cheating, Subversion, and Oppression (correlation coefficients *r* > 0.90), framing their arguments around a narrative of systemic injustice. Conversely, conservative speakers exhibit more varied profiles, ranging from traditional appeals to Loyalty and Authority (John McCain) to complex frameworks blending institutional duty with sacred values (Mitt Romney). A significant negative correlation between Loyalty and Fairness (*r* = -0.68) suggests a fundamental rhetorical trade-off in American political discourse between appeals to group solidarity and appeals to universal justice.

Crucially, the Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI), a measure of rhetorical tension, was exceptionally low across all speakers (*M* = 0.09, *SD* = 0.04), classifying every speech as demonstrating "Moral Coherence." This suggests that the framework's salience-weighting effectively identifies how speakers prioritize specific moral appeals to create a focused and non-contradictory message, a likely prerequisite for persuasive communication. The framework proved highly effective at differentiating ideological strategies and providing a nuanced, data-driven understanding of moral rhetoric, though the pervasiveness of Liberty appeals warrants further investigation into its role as a potential super-foundation in the American context.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **A "Systemic Injustice" Moral Cluster Defines Progressive Rhetoric**: The analysis identified a powerful positive correlation cluster between the Harm, Cheating, Subversion, and Oppression foundations (*r* > 0.90 across all pairs). This cluster was most salient for progressive speakers (Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders) and civil rights activist John Lewis, indicating a unified moral narrative centered on identifying and resisting systemic exploitation and abuse of power.
*   **Political Rhetoric is Characterized by High Moral Coherence**: Despite invoking a wide range of moral appeals, every speaker in the corpus demonstrated "Moral Coherence," with Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI) scores far below the 0.30 threshold (*M* = 0.09). This suggests that effective political communicators strategically manage the salience of their moral claims to avoid contradiction and present a focused, internally consistent moral vision.
*   **An Ideological Trade-Off Exists Between Loyalty and Fairness**: A significant negative correlation was found between the Loyalty and Fairness foundations (*r* = -0.68). This indicates a structural tension in political discourse: speakers who heavily emphasize in-group solidarity and national unity tend to de-emphasize appeals to impartial justice and universal rights, and vice versa.
*   **Conservative Moral Rhetoric is Diverse, Not Monolithic**: Conservative speakers displayed varied moral profiles. John McCain's rhetoric centered on traditional Loyalty and Authority. Mitt Romney presented a complex "Institutional Guardian" profile, blending high appeals to Authority, Sanctity, and Fairness. Steve King focused intensely on Betrayal and Degradation, while JD Vance showed a "Distributed Moral Identity" with the most balanced profile in the corpus (Moral Salience Concentration = 0.14).
*   **Liberty is a Pervasive, Trans-Ideological Moral Appeal**: Appeals to the Liberty/Oppression foundation were prominent across the ideological spectrum, leading to 62.5% of speakers being classified with a "Libertarian Profile" under the framework's criteria. This suggests that Liberty functions as a foundational language in American political discourse, utilized by speakers from John Lewis to Mitt Romney to frame their distinct moral arguments.
*   **Salience-Weighted Analysis Reveals Strategic Moral Priorities**: The framework's distinction between raw intensity and rhetorical salience proved critical. For example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's discourse is defined by its high *salience* on dismantling oppressive systems (Oppression salience = 0.90), while Mitt Romney's is defined by a commitment to institutional and sacred duty (Authority and Sanctity salience = 0.90), revealing their core strategic priorities.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description

This analysis employed the **Moral Foundations Theory Framework v10.0**, a computational tool designed to systematically quantify moral reasoning in political discourse. The framework is based on Jonathan Haidt's theory of six moral foundations, operationalized as opposing pairs: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, and Liberty/Oppression.

The core innovation of v10.0 is its **dual-track analysis**, which measures both the intensity (raw score) and the rhetorical prominence (salience score) of each of the 12 foundations. This allows for a more nuanced assessment of a speaker's strategic moral emphasis. From these scores, the framework calculates several derived metrics, most notably the **Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)**. The MSCI uses an advanced formula (`Moral Tension = min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) Ã— |Foundation_salience - Opposition_salience|`) to quantify the degree of contradiction between opposing moral appeals. Low MSCI scores indicate rhetorical coherence, while high scores suggest contradiction or ambivalence. Other key metrics include **Moral Salience Concentration (MSC)**, which measures the focus of a speaker's moral identity.

### Corpus Description

The analysis was conducted on the **Political Moral Analysis Corpus v3.0**, a curated collection of 8 significant American political speeches. The corpus was designed for heterogeneity to robustly test the framework, spanning a 60-year period (1963-2025) and including speakers from diverse ideological positions (Progressive, Liberal, Conservative, National Conservative, Civil Rights). The contexts include electoral speeches, legislative debates, and policy advocacy, providing a rich cross-section of American political rhetoric.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations

The analysis relied on descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and the interpretation of the framework's derived metrics. All statistical results provided by the analysis pipeline were treated as definitive. Means (*M*), standard deviations (*SD*), and correlation coefficients (*r*) are reported to two decimal places.

The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (*N* = 8). While the corpus is diverse, the findings should be considered **preliminary and indicative** rather than generalizable to all political discourse. The results demonstrate the framework's capabilities and generate hypotheses for future large-scale research but do not constitute definitive proof of universal patterns. The classification of ideological profiles is based on the explicit rules within the framework, and their labels (e.g., "Libertarian Profile") should be interpreted within that specific context.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

Analysis of the mean raw scores and salience scores across the 12 moral foundations reveals distinct patterns of emphasis in the corpus. As shown in Table 1, the foundations most intensely invoked were Harm (*M* = 0.81), Fairness (*M* = 0.81), and Oppression (*M* = 0.79). The foundations with the highest average salience were Fairness (*M* = 0.80), Harm (*M* = 0.79), and Oppression (*M* = 0.76), indicating that themes of justice, protection from harm, and freedom from control are central to the analyzed political discourse. Conversely, foundations like Care (*M* score = 0.49, *M* salience = 0.46) and Sanctity (*M* score = 0.46, *M* salience = 0.40) were used less frequently and with lower prominence.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Moral Foundation Raw and Salience Scores**
| Foundation   | Mean Raw Score | SD Raw Score | Mean Salience | SD Salience |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Care         | 0.49           | 0.30         | 0.46          | 0.32        |
| Harm         | 0.81           | 0.17         | 0.79          | 0.20        |
| Fairness     | 0.81           | 0.11         | 0.80          | 0.12        |
| Cheating     | 0.76           | 0.27         | 0.74          | 0.27        |
| Loyalty      | 0.70           | 0.12         | 0.68          | 0.16        |
| Betrayal     | 0.54           | 0.31         | 0.53          | 0.30        |
| Authority    | 0.48           | 0.31         | 0.45          | 0.31        |
| Subversion   | 0.74           | 0.28         | 0.72          | 0.27        |
| Sanctity     | 0.46           | 0.30         | 0.40          | 0.31        |
| Degradation  | 0.58           | 0.30         | 0.52          | 0.31        |
| Liberty      | 0.68           | 0.23         | 0.63          | 0.25        |
| Oppression   | 0.79           | 0.17         | 0.76          | 0.20        |
*Note: N = 8. Scores range from 0.0 to 1.0.*

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Coherence and Identity

The analysis of derived metrics yielded one of the most significant findings of this study. The **Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)** was exceptionally low for every speaker, with a mean of 0.09 (*SD* = 0.04). According to the framework's classification, any score below 0.30 indicates "Moral Coherence." The data therefore suggests that all speakers, regardless of ideology, constructed rhetorically coherent arguments by strategically managing the salience of their moral appeals to minimize contradiction.

The **Moral Salience Concentration (MSC)** metric, which measures the focus of a speaker's moral identity, revealed important variations. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (*MSC* = 0.34) and Bernie Sanders (*MSC* = 0.31) exhibited a "Focused Moral Identity," concentrating their rhetoric on a few highly salient foundations. In contrast, JD Vance (*MSC* = 0.14) displayed a "Distributed Moral Identity," engaging a wider range of moral foundations more evenly. The remaining speakers fell into the "Moderate Moral Focus" category. This metric effectively quantifies the difference between a specialist moral rhetorician and a generalist.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix of foundation salience scores revealed powerful structural relationships within the moral language of the corpus. The most striking finding is a tightly-knit cluster of four foundations: **Harm, Cheating, Subversion, and Oppression**. The correlations among these foundations were all extremely high and positive:
*   Harm and Subversion: *r* = 0.96
*   Harm and Oppression: *r* = 0.96
*   Harm and Cheating: *r* = 0.94
*   Subversion and Oppression: *r* = 0.92

This "Systemic Injustice" cluster represents a coherent moral worldview focused on identifying and combating exploitation, abuse of power, and illegitimate control.

Conversely, the analysis uncovered a strong negative relationship between **Loyalty and Fairness** (*r* = -0.68). This suggests a fundamental tension in political rhetoric: appeals to in-group solidarity and patriotism often come at the expense of appeals to impartial justice and equality, and vice-versa. This trade-off appears to be a structural feature of the moral arguments within this corpus.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

Integrating the statistical patterns with textual evidence illuminates the concrete rhetorical strategies employed by the speakers.

#### The Progressive "Systemic Injustice" Narrative

The strong positive correlation among Harm, Cheating, Subversion, and Oppression is vividly illustrated in the rhetoric of progressive speakers. Their discourse consistently links these concepts into a single narrative. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who scores high in salience on all four foundations, exemplifies this by framing systemic problems as a form of abuse. She states, **"We are witnessing an oligarchy in America,"** directly invoking Oppression, and links it to harm by declaring, **"the division that is actually hurting our country the most is how endless greed is costing the lives of everyone else"** (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This is not just about individual bad acts but about a corrupt system, a point she makes explicit: **"And Greeley, there's a word for this kind of thing, corruption"** (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

This pattern is echoed by Bernie Sanders, whose high salience on Fairness (0.95) and Cheating (0.95) underpins his focus on economic injustice. He frames the actions of the wealthy as a form of systemic cheating that causes widespread harm: **"They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer"** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This fusion of moral appeals creates a powerful and coherent narrative of a rigged system causing suffering, which requires subversive action to correct.

#### The Conservative Spectrum: Guardians, Patriots, and Purists

The data refutes the idea of a single conservative moral profile. Instead, we see distinct archetypes. Mitt Romney emerges as an "Institutional Guardian." His profile is defined by extremely high salience for Authority (0.90), Sanctity (0.90), and Fairness (0.90). His speech on impeachment is a masterclass in weaving these together. He grounds his decision in a sacred duty to an authoritative text, stating, **"I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice"** and **"The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success"** (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt). For Romney, the President's actions were not just a political misstep but a violation of this sacred, authoritative order, an **"appalling abuse of public trust"** that constituted a **"flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values"** (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt).

In contrast, John McCain's concession speech embodies a more traditional "National Patriot" archetype. His rhetoric has the highest salience on Loyalty (0.80) and Fairness (0.70), with very little emphasis on Sanctity or Purity. His call to action is one of national unity and deference to the democratic process: **"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

Steve King represents a third "Moral Purist" archetype, with high salience on Betrayal (0.90), Authority (0.90), and Degradation (0.80). His argument is centered on the idea that institutions have been corrupted and have betrayed their purpose. He speaks of officials who have **"not kept their oath of office to support and defend the Constitution"** (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), framing this as a form of betrayal that leads to moral decay.

#### The Centrality of Liberty

The Liberty/Oppression foundation was a powerful theme across the board. John Lewis's 1963 speech is the quintessential example, with Liberty achieving a perfect salience score of 1.0. His famous demand, **"We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!"** (Source: john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington.txt), is a pure expression of this foundation. Yet, Liberty is not confined to the left. Cory Booker frames criminal justice reform as a matter of freedom, arguing the system violates the value of **"liberty and justice for all"** (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt). Even Mitt Romney uses it to condemn the president's actions as an assault on **"our electoral rights"** (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt). This pervasiveness suggests that in American political culture, Liberty is a master frame that various ideologies use to articulate their specific moral visions.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The MFT v10.0 framework demonstrated high effectiveness in this analysis. Its primary strengths are:
1.  **Discriminatory Power**: The framework successfully differentiated the moral strategies of speakers from diverse ideological backgrounds, revealing distinct patterns and archetypes that align with qualitative understandings of these figures.
2.  **Coherence Identification**: The salience-weighted MSCI metric proved exceptionally valuable. By revealing the underlying coherence in all speeches, it provides a data-driven explanation for how political rhetoric can be persuasive even when it touches on potentially conflicting values. It suggests speakers achieve coherence not by avoiding certain foundations, but by strategically de-emphasizing those that would conflict with their core message.
3.  **Construct Validity**: The strong correlation patterns (e.g., the "Systemic Injustice" cluster) and the negative correlation between Loyalty and Fairness provide evidence for the framework's construct validity. These statistical relationships map onto well-understood ideological tensions.

One area for potential refinement is the **ideological classification schema**. The "Libertarian Profile" classification, triggered by a high Liberty foundation mean, was applied to a very broad range of speakers (from Ocasio-Cortez to Romney). While this reflects the pervasive use of liberty rhetoric, it may obscure other important distinctions. Future iterations could develop a more nuanced typology that accounts for how Liberty is combined with other foundations.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis have several important theoretical implications. The universal "Moral Coherence" across all speakers suggests that maintaining a low level of strategic contradiction may be a fundamental principle of effective political communication. Persuasion may depend on presenting an argument that does not induce cognitive dissonance in the audience. Speakers achieve this by creating a clear hierarchy of moral priorities, where one or two foundations are given high salience and others are downplayed.

The identification of the "Systemic Injustice" cluster (Harm, Cheating, Subversion, Oppression) provides a quantitative moral grammar for a particular brand of progressive politics. This is not just a collection of grievances but a structurally coherent worldview that links personal suffering to systemic corruption and demands revolutionary change. This contrasts sharply with the more varied moral grammars on the right, which appear to offer multiple paths: a "Guardian" path focused on preserving sacred institutions (Romney), a "Patriot" path focused on national unity (McCain), and a "Purist" path focused on combating betrayal and decay (King).

The negative correlation between Loyalty and Fairness (*r* = -0.68) points to a core dilemma in liberal democracies. It is the quantitative echo of the classic tension between communitarian and universalist ethics. Political rhetoric, this data suggests, often forces a choice between appealing to the bonds of a specific "us" and appealing to the rights of "all."

Finally, the study highlights the power of salience-weighted analysis. By moving beyond simply counting moral words to measuring their rhetorical emphasis, the MFT v10.0 framework offers a more dynamic and realistic model of moral reasoning. It reveals not just what moral values are present, but which ones *matter most* to a speaker's argument, providing a map of their strategic moral priorities.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis successfully validated the MFT v10.0 framework as a sophisticated tool for dissecting the moral architecture of political discourse. The study's key contribution is the empirical demonstration that political rhetoric, across a wide ideological and historical spectrum, is characterized by a high degree of moral coherence. This coherence is achieved by strategically prioritizing certain moral appeals over others, a pattern revealed by the framework's novel salience-weighted tension analysis.

The research uncovered distinct moral profiles, including a potent "Systemic Injustice" cluster defining progressive rhetoric and a diverse set of archetypes on the conservative side. These findings, while preliminary due to the small sample size, provide a robust, data-driven foundation for future research. They suggest that the deep divisions in American politics are not necessarily about a lack of shared values, but about fundamentally different hierarchies of those values. By quantifying these hierarchies, this methodology offers a powerful new lens for understanding why good people are so often divided by politics.
