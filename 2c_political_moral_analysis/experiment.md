# Political Moral Analysis Experiment

## Abstract

This experiment validates the Moral Foundations Theory v10.0 framework using a diverse corpus of American political speeches spanning 60 years of political discourse. The corpus includes 8 speeches from different ideological positions, historical periods (1963-2022), and contexts (electoral, legislative, policy advocacy). This heterogeneous design provides a robust test of the framework's analytical capabilities across varied political discourse contexts while enabling comprehensive moral foundation pattern analysis.

## Research Questions

Can computational moral analysis reliably detect and quantify moral foundation patterns across diverse political contexts, speakers, and historical periods with statistical confidence and replicable results?

## Expected Outcomes

This experiment will produce empirical findings on framework validation, ideological differentiation, tension analysis, statistical confidence, and methodological advancement. The analysis will include multi-evaluation reliability assessment, correlation analysis, distribution analysis, reliability analysis, and comprehensive academic-quality documentation.

## Methodology

### Framework
**Moral Foundations Theory v10.0** provides:
- Six moral foundation pairs (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, Liberty/Oppression)
- JSON-first architecture for reliable data generation and synthesis
- Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI) calculated through explicit mathematical formulas
- Salience-enhanced analysis capturing rhetorical emphasis patterns
- Enhanced reliability through THIN architecture principles

### Enhanced Analysis Features (v10.0)
- **Multi-evaluation**: 2 independent evaluations per document for reliability assessment
- **Statistical validation**: Correlation analysis, distribution analysis, reliability analysis
- **Confidence metrics**: 95% confidence level with variance threshold monitoring
- **Effect size reporting**: Comprehensive statistical documentation

### Corpus Composition
8 diverse political speeches representing:
- **Ideological Spectrum**: Progressive (Sanders, AOC) to Conservative (Romney, McCain, King)
- **Historical Range**: 1963 (Lewis) to 2022 (Vance)
- **Contextual Variety**: Electoral, legislative, policy advocacy, civil rights
- **Quality assurance**: Verified sources, consistent formatting, validated metadata

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Framework Validation**: v10.0 framework successfully processes diverse political discourse with statistical reliability
2. **Ideological Differentiation**: Measurable variation in moral foundation emphasis patterns across political perspectives
3. **Tension Analysis**: MSCI reveals meaningful patterns of moral coherence/contradiction across speakers
4. **Statistical Confidence**: Multi-evaluation approach demonstrates framework reliability with coefficient > 0.70
5. **Methodological Advancement**: Enhanced reporting provides comprehensive academic-quality documentation

## Significance

This experiment establishes the Moral Foundations Theory v10.0 framework as a reliable tool for computational moral analysis in political discourse, providing both theoretical validation and practical demonstration of enhanced statistical capabilities. The v10.0 experiment specification ensures academic-quality rigor suitable for peer review and replication.
