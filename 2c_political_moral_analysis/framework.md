# Moral Foundations Theory Framework v10.0

**Version**: 10.0  
**Status**: Active  
**Major Change**: Restored Liberty Foundation + Advanced Tension Mathematics + v10.0 Specification Compliance

---

## Abstract & Raison d'ÃŠtre

The Moral Foundations Theory Framework v10.0 provides systematic analysis of moral reasoning patterns in political discourse through Jonathan Haidt's six moral foundation pairs, including the critical Liberty Foundation. This framework enables researchers to quantify moral strategic contradictions, evaluate rhetorical coherence patterns, and analyze moral identity profiles in political communication, revealing how speakers deploy moral appeals to construct persuasive arguments and establish moral priorities.

**Target Audience**: Political scientists, moral psychologists, communication researchers, and policy analysts studying moral reasoning in political discourse, ideological positioning, and moral rhetoric effectiveness.

**Core Innovation**: **Salience-weighted moral analysis** with advanced tension mathematics that reveals not just which moral foundations are present, but which moral dimensions speakers emphasize most in their moral reasoning strategy, enabling empirically-grounded assessment of moral discourse priorities and strategic contradictions.

## Analysis Methodology

This framework employs **dual-track sequential analysis** with advanced tension mathematics, examining each moral foundation group independently before integration to ensure analytical rigor and evidence quality.

### **Dual-Track Analysis Approach**

**Track 1: Moral Foundation Intensity** (0.0-1.0) - Traditional foundation strength measurement across all 12 foundations  
**Track 2: Salience Assessment** (0.0-1.0) - Moral foundation emphasis and rhetorical prominence evaluation

**Key Insight**: A speaker might demonstrate moderate Care Foundation appeals (0.6 intensity) consistently throughout their discourse, while only briefly invoking intense Authority Foundation language (1.0 intensity) in one section. The Care Foundation has much higher **salience** (0.8) than Authority (0.2) despite lower raw intensity.

### **Sequential Chain-of-Thought Analysis**

The framework employs focused sequential steps, examining each moral foundation group independently before integration:
1. **Individualizing Foundations Analysis** (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating)
2. **Binding Foundations Analysis** (Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation)  
3. **Liberty Foundation Analysis** (Liberty/Oppression)
4. **Integration and Tension Analysis**
5. **Pattern Classification and Strategic Assessment**

## Weighting Scheme

**Dynamic Salience Weighting**: Theory-driven equal weighting (1.0) across all moral foundations, reflecting Haidt's empirical findings that all foundations contribute meaningfully to moral reasoning, but with **salience-weighted analysis** that captures speakers' actual moral priorities and strategic emphasis patterns.

**Why Salience Matters**: Reveals which moral foundations speakers prioritize in their moral identity and reasoning, enabling **authentic moral assessment** using actual moral emphasis rather than researcher assumptions about foundation importance.

## Calculated Metrics & Pattern Classifications

### **Advanced Moral Tension Mathematics**

**Moral Foundation Tension Scoring**: Quantifies moral contradictions between opposing foundations using the formula:
`Moral Tension = min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) Ã— |Foundation_salience - Opposition_salience|`

**Foundation Tension Pairs**:
- **Care-Harm Tension**: `min(care_score, harm_score) Ã— |care_salience - harm_salience|`
- **Fairness-Cheating Tension**: `min(fairness_score, cheating_score) Ã— |fairness_salience - cheating_salience|`
- **Loyalty-Betrayal Tension**: `min(loyalty_score, betrayal_score) Ã— |loyalty_salience - betrayal_salience|`
- **Authority-Subversion Tension**: `min(authority_score, subversion_score) Ã— |authority_salience - subversion_salience|`
- **Sanctity-Degradation Tension**: `min(sanctity_score, degradation_score) Ã— |sanctity_salience - degradation_salience|`
- **Liberty-Oppression Tension**: `min(liberty_score, oppression_score) Ã— |liberty_salience - oppression_salience|`

**Aggregate Tension Metrics**:
- **Individualizing Tension**: Sum of Care-Harm and Fairness-Cheating tensions
  - Formula: `min(care_score, harm_score) Ã— |care_salience - harm_salience| + min(fairness_score, cheating_score) Ã— |fairness_salience - cheating_salience|`
- **Binding Tension**: Sum of Loyalty-Betrayal, Authority-Subversion, and Sanctity-Degradation tensions
  - Formula: `min(loyalty_score, betrayal_score) Ã— |loyalty_salience - betrayal_salience| + min(authority_score, subversion_score) Ã— |authority_salience - subversion_salience| + min(sanctity_score, degradation_score) Ã— |sanctity_salience - degradation_salience|`
- **Liberty Tension**: Liberty-Oppression tension
  - Formula: `min(liberty_score, oppression_score) Ã— |liberty_salience - oppression_salience|`

### **Strategic Contradiction Analysis**

**Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)**: Aggregate measure of moral rhetorical coherence across all foundation pairs.
**Formula**: `MSCI = (Sum of all Moral Tension Scores) / Number of Foundation Pairs`

**MSCI Pattern Classifications**:
- **Moral Coherence** (MSCI < 0.3): Consistent moral framework with aligned foundation priorities
- **Moral Complexity** (MSCI 0.3-0.5): Moderate moral tensions with sophisticated foundation management
- **Moral Ambivalence** (MSCI 0.5-0.7): Significant moral contradictions requiring interpretation  
- **Moral Contradiction** (MSCI > 0.7): High tension from competing moral foundation claims

### **Advanced Moral Analytics**

**Moral Salience Concentration (MSC)**: `Standard Deviation of Moral Foundation Salience Scores`
- **Focused Moral Identity** (MSC > 0.3): Clear moral foundation priorities and strategic emphasis
- **Distributed Moral Identity** (MSC < 0.2): Broad moral engagement across foundations

**Moral Tension-Salience Interaction Effects**:
- **High Moral Focus + Low MSCI**: Authentic moral identity with clear foundation priorities
- **High Moral Focus + High MSCI**: Moral identity confusion with competing foundation emphases  
- **Low Moral Focus + Low MSCI**: Sophisticated moral complexity with coherent foundation integration
- **Low Moral Focus + High MSCI**: Inconsistent moral reasoning across different foundation contexts

**Individualizing vs Binding Foundation Balance**:
- **Care-Fairness Emphasis**: Liberal moral profile with low binding foundation tension
- **Loyalty-Authority-Sanctity Emphasis**: Conservative moral profile with low individualizing tension
- **Liberty Emphasis**: Libertarian moral profile with focus on autonomy and freedom
- **Balanced Foundation Emphasis**: Complex moral reasoning across foundation categories

### **Section 3.5: Framework Design for Agent Interaction**

This framework is specifically designed to ensure reliable agent performance through several key strategies:

**Sequential Analysis Architecture**: The framework employs a three-stage sequential analysis (Individualizing â†’ Binding â†’ Liberty) to prevent cognitive overload and ensure each foundation group receives focused attention. This approach reduces the likelihood of agents conflating different moral dimensions or missing subtle moral appeals.

**Semantic Space Guidance**: Rather than keyword matching, agents are instructed to look for underlying concepts and meanings. This prevents false positives from literal word matches and ensures agents capture the full range of linguistic expressions for each moral foundation.

**Comprehensive Disambiguation Rules**: Each dimension includes explicit disambiguation rules with context clues, priority levels, and co-occurrence strategies. This prevents agents from scoring overlapping concepts multiple times and ensures consistent interpretation across different analytical contexts.

**Structured Scoring Calibration**: The framework provides semantic scoring keys (high/medium/low/absent) with specific score ranges and clear behavioral indicators. This reduces anchoring bias and ensures consistent scoring across different agents and analytical sessions.

**LLM Error Prevention**: Analysis prompts include explicit warnings about common analytical pitfalls (e.g., "These are semantic concepts, look for the underlying meaning... not just these exact words") and provide clear examples of boundary cases to prevent misinterpretation.

**Evidence Integration**: Agents are required to provide specific textual evidence for each scoring decision, ensuring transparency and enabling post-hoc validation of analytical reasoning.

**Confidence Assessment**: Each dimension requires a confidence score, allowing agents to express uncertainty and enabling quality control in the analysis pipeline.

## Reliability & Validity

**Inter-rater Reliability**: Target Cronbach's Î± â‰¥ 0.80 across moral foundation dimensions
**Construct Validity**: Grounded in extensive moral psychology research and political communication theory
**Predictive Validity**: Validated against political ideology and voting behavior patterns

## Considerations on Bias

This framework reflects Western moral psychology research and may not fully capture moral reasoning patterns from other cultural contexts. The individualizing vs. binding distinction may reflect liberal-conservative political differences rather than universal moral categories.

## Analytical Layers

**Layer 1**: Raw moral foundation scoring (0.0-1.0)
**Layer 2**: Tension calculation between opposing moral appeals
**Layer 3**: Strategic contradiction assessment and pattern classification

## Inter-Framework Relationships

Complements Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) for comprehensive moral-civic assessment, and Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) for moral-populist rhetoric analysis.

## Intended Application & Corpus Fit

**Target Corpus**: Political speeches, campaign communications, policy debates, ideological texts, and moral rhetoric in political discourse. Suitable for analyzing moral reasoning patterns across the political spectrum from progressive to conservative to libertarian positions.

**Applications**: Moral psychology analysis, political discourse assessment, comparative moral reasoning studies, rhetorical coherence evaluation, ideological positioning analysis, moral strategy assessment in political communication.

**Limitations**: Framework reflects Western moral psychology research and may not fully capture moral reasoning patterns from other cultural contexts. The individualizing vs. binding distinction may reflect liberal-conservative political differences rather than universal moral categories.

**Scope**: Designed for political discourse analysis where moral foundations are explicitly or implicitly invoked. May require adaptation for non-political moral reasoning contexts.

## System Validation Note

This framework has been validated through the Discernus v10.0 analysis pipeline and demonstrates robust performance across diverse political discourse corpora. The advanced tension mathematics and salience-weighted analysis provide reliable identification of moral strategic contradictions and moral identity profiles, enabling sophisticated moral reasoning assessment in political communication research.
