## **Executive Summary**
This report details the results of an analysis applying the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.3 to a corpus of eight political texts. The objective was to assess the framework's ability to differentiate speakers and validate its theoretical structure.

Initial findings indicate that the framework's composite metrics, such as the Civic Character Index and Virtue Index, show substantial variance across the corpus, suggesting a capacity to distinguish between speakers [1]. Descriptive statistics reveal a wide range of scores, with the Civic Character Index spanning from 0.23 to 0.89 [2].

Correlation analysis provides empirical support for the framework's bipolar axis design. Strong negative correlations were observed between dignity and tribalism (r = -0.79), truth and manipulation (r = -0.86), and pragmatism and fantasy (r = -0.87) [3]. This suggests these opposing concepts were used in a mutually exclusive manner in the analyzed texts. Furthermore, the analysis identified strong positive correlations between pathological dimensions (e.g., tribalism and manipulation, r = 0.94) and a notable positive correlation between the virtues of dignity and pragmatism (r = 0.94), indicating potential rhetorical clustering [3].

A primary limitation of this study is the small sample size (N=8), which precludes inferential statistical tests such as ANOVA. Therefore, all findings should be interpreted as descriptive and preliminary.

## **Collaborator Section**

### **Claim 1: Variance in Character Coherence**
- **Hypothesis (H3):** MC-SCI scores will vary meaningfully between speakers, indicating different levels of character coherence. This claim is testable.
- **Statistical Result:** The Civic Character Index, a measure of character coherence, demonstrated a wide distribution across the eight documents. Scores ranged from a minimum of 0.23 to a maximum of 0.89, with a mean of 0.56 [2]. This variance suggests the framework is capturing distinct character patterns.
- **Evidence:**
    - "But my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country. I'm a senator for the state of Ohio. Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country." [1]
    - "Because in this house, we stand together, we know that, that it's our only choice because we know that without exception, if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win." [2]

### **Claim 2: Differentiation Across Dimensions**
- **Hypothesis (H1):** The 10 CAF dimensions will show statistically significant differences between speakers. This claim is testable, though significance cannot be established with the current data.
- **Statistical Result:** The composite Virtue Index, an average of the five positive dimensions, showed substantial variation. Scores ranged from 0.24 to 0.86, with a mean of 0.63 [2]. This range provides preliminary evidence that the underlying dimensions capture different rhetorical profiles.
- **Evidence:**
    - "And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people." [3]
    - "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [4]

### **Claim 3: Identity Axis Validation**
- **Exploratory Claim:** This claim tests the theoretical opposition of the dignity and tribalism dimensions.
- **Statistical Result:** A strong negative Pearson correlation (r = -0.79) was observed between dignity scores and tribalism scores across the dataset [3]. This supports the framework's construction of the Identity Axis as a bipolar construct.
- **Evidence:**
    - "It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, 'Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.'" [5]
    - "we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own." [6]

### **Claim 4: Truth Axis Validation**
- **Exploratory Claim:** This claim evaluates the structural integrity of the Truth Axis.
- **Statistical Result:** A very strong negative Pearson correlation (r = -0.86) was found between truth scores and manipulation scores [3]. This result validates the theoretical opposition between these two dimensions within the framework.
- **Evidence:**
    - "It would be, you, the, the equivalent of allowing the Nazi Germans in 1942 to make all of our ships and missiles." [7]
    - "though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours." [8]

### **Claim 5: Justice Axis Relationship**
- **Exploratory Claim:** This claim examines the relationship between the justice and resentment dimensions.
- **Statistical Result:** A moderate negative Pearson correlation (r = -0.45) was observed between justice and resentment scores [3]. While this supports the framework's theoretical opposition, the weaker relationship compared to other axes may suggest a more complex interaction between these concepts.
- **Evidence:**
    - "We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color." [9]
    - "But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside." [10]

### **Claim 6: Reality Axis Validation**
- **Exploratory Claim:** This claim tests the validity of the Reality Axis.
- **Statistical Result:** A very strong negative Pearson correlation (r = -0.87) was found between pragmatism and fantasy scores [3]. This provides robust support for the bipolar construction of this dimension.
- **Evidence:**
    - "I donâ€™t have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%." [11]
    - "But, Greeley, that means our communities choosing and voting for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class." [12]

### **Claim 7: Pathological Clustering**
- **Exploratory Claim:** This claim investigates the co-occurrence of pathological dimensions.
- **Statistical Result:** The analysis revealed very strong positive correlations among pathological dimensions. For instance, the correlation between tribalism and manipulation was r = 0.94, and between tribalism and resentment was r = 0.94 [3]. This suggests these rhetorical strategies may be deployed as an integrated pattern.
- **Evidence:**
    - "They want us to think that our lives are suffering because of the LGBT kid down the street or because of the mixed status family or the dreamer down the block who's just trying to make a better life for themselves. But we're smarter than that Greeley." [13]
    - "This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others." [14]

### **Claim 8: Virtuous Clustering**
- **Exploratory Claim:** This claim investigates an observed link between distinct virtue dimensions.
- **Statistical Result:** An exceptionally strong positive Pearson correlation (r = 0.94) was observed between dignity and pragmatism scores [3]. This suggests that in the analyzed texts, appeals to universal human worth are closely linked to appeals for practical, realistic solutions.
- **Evidence:**
    - "It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, 'Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.'" [15]
    - "But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside." [16]
