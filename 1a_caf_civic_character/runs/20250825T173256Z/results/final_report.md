## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a computational analysis of political discourse using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis was conducted on a small, preliminary corpus of eight documents from distinct political speakers. The primary objective was to apply the CAF's virtue-based methodology to quantify the civic character of political rhetoric and identify underlying strategic patterns. Despite the exploratory nature of this study, the results indicate that the CAF is a promising tool for systematically evaluating political communication.

The analysis reveals significant differentiation in the civic character of the speakers. The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI), a key metric derived from the framework, effectively ranked speakers on a spectrum from highly virtuous to highly vice-driven rhetoric. The data shows John McCain exhibiting the most virtuous profile (CCI = +0.80), while Steve King displayed the most vice-oriented profile (CCI = -0.48). This quantitative differentiation was supported by a qualitative classification that identified distinct rhetorical archetypes, including "Authentic Virtue" (e.g., John McCain, Mitt Romney) and "Strategic Pathology" (e.g., Bernie Sanders, Steve King). These archetypes are characterized by coherent, but opposing, rhetorical strategies focused on either civic virtues or their pathological counterparts.

From a methodological standpoint, this analysis provides strong preliminary evidence for the CAF's construct validity. The framework's oppositional design—pitting virtues against corresponding vices—was empirically supported by a correlation analysis of the ten core rhetorical dimensions. As hypothesized, virtues were strongly and negatively correlated with their opposing vices, most notably between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93) and `dignity` and `tribalism` (r = -0.81). These findings suggest the framework's theoretical axes capture real, competing tensions in political language. However, the analysis was constrained by a small sample size (N=8) and a lack of corpus metadata, which prevented a planned validation against rhetorical styles. Therefore, all findings should be considered indicative and require validation with larger, more diverse datasets.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of civic character in political discourse yielded several key insights, supported by statistical data from the CAF v10.0 framework.

*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) effectively stratifies speakers.** The analysis produced a wide distribution of CCI scores, ranging from +0.80 for John McCain to -0.48 for Steve King. This suggests the CCI is a sensitive metric capable of capturing significant variance in the overall civic quality of rhetoric across different political actors.
*   **The framework’s theoretical structure is empirically supported.** The data reveals strong negative correlations between the virtues and vices defined by the CAF. The particularly strong negative correlation between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93) and `dignity` and `tribalism` (r = -0.81) provides preliminary validation for the framework's core oppositional axes.
*   **Distinct rhetorical archetypes emerge from the data.** Speakers cluster into coherent patterns of communication. The "Authentic Virtue" archetype, exemplified by John McCain (CCI = +0.80, Mean Tension = 0.01), is characterized by high virtue scores and low strategic contradiction. In contrast, the "Strategic Pathology" archetype, seen in Bernie Sanders (CCI = -0.39, Mean Vice Salience = 0.72), relies heavily on vice-based appeals.
*   **Rhetorical tension reveals strategic complexity.** The analysis of Character Tension Indices indicates that some speakers simultaneously deploy virtuous and vicious appeals. Bernie Sanders, for instance, shows the highest `mean_tension` (0.144), particularly on the justice-resentment axis. This suggests a complex populist strategy that combines calls for justice with strong appeals to grievance.
*   **Virtues and vices operate in distinct, opposing clusters.** The correlation matrix shows that virtues like `dignity`, `justice`, and `truth` are positively correlated with each other, while vices like `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` are also positively correlated. This suggests the presence of two overarching, competing meta-strategies in the corpus: one constructive and unifying, the other divisive and distorting.
*   **The Justice/Resentment axis shows weaker opposition than other axes.** The correlation between `justice` and `resentment` (r = -0.34) is notably weaker than other virtue/vice pairs. This suggests that, in this corpus, speakers are more able to blend appeals to justice with rhetoric of resentment, a finding that warrants further investigation into the nature of populist and activist rhetoric.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The CAF is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. It assesses the rhetorical choices of speakers across five fundamental axes, each representing a tension between a civic virtue and its corresponding vice:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `dignity` (appeals to universal human worth) vs. `tribalism` (appeals to in-group/out-group dynamics).
2.  **Truth Axis:** `truth` (appeals to intellectual honesty and facts) vs. `manipulation` (appeals using deception or distortion).
3.  **Justice Axis:** `justice` (appeals to fairness and systemic equity) vs. `resentment` (appeals to grievance and blame).
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `hope` (appeals to positive, future-oriented action) vs. `fear` (appeals to threat and anxiety).
5.  **Reality Axis:** `pragmatism` (appeals acknowledging complexity and constraints) vs. `fantasy` (appeals based on oversimplification or denial of reality).

For each of the ten dimensions, the analysis produced a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (emphasis, 0-1). From these, two types of advanced metrics were calculated: five **Character Tension Indices** (measuring the strategic contradiction on each axis) and a single **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, which provides an overall measure of a text's civic quality, ranging from -1.0 (vice-dominant) to +1.0 (virtue-dominant).

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on a corpus of eight political texts. Due to a missing corpus manifest file, metadata such as document dates, context, and pre-defined speaker styles were unavailable. Speaker identification was performed by parsing the filenames of the documents. The corpus includes texts from: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, JD Vance, John Lewis, John McCain, Mitt Romney, and Steve King.

The small sample size (N=8) means this study is exploratory and its findings should be considered preliminary. The primary purpose is to demonstrate the application of the CAF and generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis involved several statistical procedures automatically generated for this experiment:

1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all raw and salience scores to understand the central tendencies and distribution of rhetorical appeals across the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for the ten raw dimension scores to examine the relationships between rhetorical strategies and to assess the framework's construct validity. As the CAF is an oppositional framework, strong negative correlations between a virtue and its corresponding vice are interpreted as evidence of validity.
3.  **Derived Metric Calculation:** The analysis computed the Tension Indices and the Civic Character Index (CCI) for each document according to the formulas specified in the CAF.
4.  **Archetype Classification:** A rule-based classification system, derived from the framework's interpretive guidance, was applied to speaker profiles to identify dominant rhetorical patterns such as "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology."

A key constraint was the failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function, which reported that the necessary 'style' metadata was not present in the corpus. This prevented a planned analysis comparing CAF scores across predefined rhetorical categories (e.g., populist vs. institutional). This highlights a critical dependency on well-curated metadata for certain types of computational analysis.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

The statistical analysis yielded a multi-layered view of the civic character within the corpus. The results are presented below, moving from foundational descriptive statistics to more complex relational and archetypal analyses. All interpretations are made with the explicit acknowledgment of the study's small sample size.

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the ten raw scores and ten salience scores provides a baseline understanding of the rhetorical landscape of the corpus.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**
```

| std       |         0.419 |       0.362 |            0.374 |     0.213 |          0.355 |       0.315 |    0.245 |    0.278 |       0.288 |          0.372 |
| min       |         0.000 |       0.000 |            0.000 |     0.300 |          0.000 |       0.000 |    0.100 |    0.100 |       0.000 |          0.000 |
| 50%       |         0.650 |       0.750 |            0.250 |     0.750 |          0.900 |       0.700 |    0.450 |    0.600 |       0.050 |          0.750 |
| max       |         0.900 |       0.900 |            0.800 |     0.900 |          0.950 |       0.900 |    0.900 |    0.900 |       0.700 |          0.900 |
```
*Note: Table shows raw scores for brevity; salience scores followed similar patterns.*

The data indicates that `resentment` (mean = 0.706) and `truth` (mean = 0.663) were the most prominent raw dimensions used across the corpus. This suggests a rhetorical environment where appeals to grievance and factual claims are common strategies. The high mean score for `resentment` is exemplified in the available evidence. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This quote, which scored a perfect 1.0 for `resentment_confidence`, directly identifies a grievance and assigns blame to a "rigged economy," aligning perfectly with the dimension's definition.

Conversely, `fantasy` (mean = 0.200) and `manipulation` (mean = 0.338) were the least utilized dimensions on average. However, the standard deviations for most dimensions are quite high (e.g., `tribalism_raw` std = 0.419), indicating substantial variance among speakers. This suggests that while some speakers avoid these vices, others rely on them heavily, a pattern explored in the following sections.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a more nuanced assessment of civic character by integrating raw scores and salience into composite indices. The analysis of speaker profiles reveals clear archetypal patterns.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Coherence and Archetype Classification**

| mitt_romney              |                   0.500 |          0.042 | Authentic Virtue         |             0.720 |                  0.720 |           0.180 |                0.240 |

| bernie_sanders           |                  -0.394 |          0.144 | Strategic Pathology      |             0.380 |                  0.340 |           0.730 |                0.720 |
| steve_king               |                  -0.480 |          0.074 | Strategic Pathology      |             0.260 |                  0.300 |           0.820 |                0.830 |

The **Civic Character Index (CCI)** provides a clear ranking of speakers. A cluster of speakers—John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney—emerge with high positive scores, classified as "Authentic Virtue." Their profiles are defined by high mean virtue scores, low mean vice scores, and very low `mean_tension`. This indicates a coherent, virtue-focused rhetorical style. The profile of John McCain is particularly striking. His CCI of +0.805 is the highest in the corpus, driven by a near-total absence of vice appeals (mean vice raw = 0.02) and a focus on virtues like `dignity` and `pragmatism`. This is supported by textual evidence from his speech. As John McCain stated: **"These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face."** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This statement's acknowledgment of difficulty and practical offer of help exemplifies the `pragmatism` that contributes to his high CCI score.

At the other end of the spectrum, Steve King and Bernie Sanders are classified as "Strategic Pathology." Their profiles are mirror images of the "Authentic Virtue" cluster, with negative CCI scores, high mean vice scores, and low mean virtue scores. Bernie Sanders' profile is notable for having the highest `mean_tension` (0.144), suggesting a complex strategy that blends opposing appeals. His high scores in vices like `tribalism` and `resentment` are illustrated by his rhetoric. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%."** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This quote establishes a clear "us vs. them" framing central to the `tribalism` dimension.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix for the ten raw CAF dimensions provides critical insight into the framework's internal structure and the co-occurrence of rhetorical strategies.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix for CAF Raw Dimensions**
|             | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth | resentment | justice | fear  | hope  | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:------------|----------:|--------:|-------------:|------:|-----------:|--------:|------:|------:|--------:|-----------:|
| **tribalism** |     1.00  |   -0.81 |         0.91 | -0.79 |       0.80 |   -0.71 |  0.40 | -0.23 |    0.72 |      -0.76 |
| **dignity**   |    -0.81  |    1.00 |        -0.87 |  0.67 |      -0.52 |    0.87 | -0.58 |  0.50 |   -0.75 |       0.67 |
| **manipulation**|     0.91  |   -0.87 |         1.00 | -0.77 |       0.61 |   -0.75 |  0.33 | -0.30 |    0.89 |      -0.91 |
| **truth**     |    -0.79  |    0.67 |        -0.77 |  1.00 |      -0.55 |    0.84 |  0.08 | -0.16 |   -0.56 |       0.52 |
| **resentment**|     0.80  |   -0.52 |         0.61 | -0.55 |       1.00 |   -0.34 |  0.41 | -0.07 |    0.48 |      -0.51 |
| **justice**   |    -0.71  |    0.87 |        -0.75 |  0.84 |      -0.34 |    1.00 | -0.19 |  0.13 |   -0.54 |       0.43 |
| **fear**      |     0.40  |   -0.58 |         0.33 |  0.08 |       0.41 |   -0.19 |  1.00 | -0.87 |    0.30 |      -0.30 |
| **hope**      |    -0.23  |    0.50 |        -0.30 | -0.16 |      -0.07 |    0.13 | -0.87 |  1.00 |   -0.38 |       0.37 |
| **fantasy**   |     0.72  |   -0.75 |         0.89 | -0.56 |       0.48 |   -0.54 |  0.30 | -0.38 |    1.00 |      -0.93 |
| **pragmatism**|    -0.76  |    0.67 |        -0.91 |  0.52 |      -0.51 |    0.43 | -0.30 |  0.37 |   -0.93 |       1.00 |

These results offer strong preliminary validation for the CAF's oppositional design. The key findings are:
1.  **Strong Negative Correlations on Axes:** The virtue on each axis is strongly and negatively correlated with its opposing vice. For example, `dignity` vs. `tribalism` (r = -0.81), `hope` vs. `fear` (r = -0.87), and most powerfully, `pragmatism` vs. `fantasy` (r = -0.93). This indicates that speakers in this corpus who use one tend to avoid the other, supporting the framework's conceptualization of these as competing rhetorical choices.
2.  **Clustering of Virtues and Vices:** Virtues are generally positively correlated with other virtues (e.g., `justice` and `dignity`, r = +0.87). Similarly, vices are positively correlated with other vices (e.g., `tribalism` and `manipulation`, r = +0.91). This suggests the existence of two broader, coherent meta-strategies: a "virtue-based" approach and a "vice-based" approach.
3.  **The Centrality of the Reality Axis:** `Pragmatism` and its opposite, `fantasy`, show some of the strongest correlations in the entire matrix. `Pragmatism` is strongly negatively correlated with `manipulation` (r = -0.91) and `tribalism` (r = -0.76), while `fantasy` is strongly positively correlated with them. This suggests that the choice to ground rhetoric in reality versus fantasy is a central organizing principle of civic discourse in this dataset.

The opposition between `dignity` and `tribalism` is well-illustrated by contrasting speaker evidence. John McCain's appeal to universal dignity, **"This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), stands in stark contrast to the divisive, group-based logic of Bernie Sanders' `tribalism` appeal.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns reveal important structural features of the political rhetoric in this corpus and speak to the CAF's theoretical underpinnings. The strongest correlations observed, such as `pragmatism`/`fantasy` (r = -0.93) and `manipulation`/`pragmatism` (r = -0.91), suggest that a fundamental cleavage in this discourse is between communication that acknowledges complexity and reality versus communication that simplifies and distorts it for strategic ends.

An unexpected and particularly insightful finding is the relatively weak negative correlation between `justice` and `resentment` (r = -0.34). Compared to other virtue/vice pairs, this opposition is far less pronounced. This suggests that speakers can, and do, blend appeals for systemic fairness (`justice`) with blame-focused grievance (`resentment`). This pattern is a hallmark of certain populist styles, where a call to rectify a "rigged system" is a central theme. The textual evidence for Bernie Sanders supports this interpretation, as the same statement was identified as containing elements of both dimensions. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This finding indicates that the Justice/Resentment axis may capture a more complex and less mutually exclusive dynamic than other axes, a point that warrants significant further investigation.

These statistical patterns provide preliminary evidence for the construct validity of the CAF. The framework is not merely imposing a theoretical structure but appears to be measuring real, systematic patterns of co-occurrence and opposition in language. The data suggests that the five axes are not entirely independent but are linked by two overarching rhetorical postures: one that is constructive, unifying, and reality-based, and another that is deconstructive, divisive, and reality-distorting.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 demonstrates considerable effectiveness, with some clear limitations.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework exhibits high discriminatory power. The CCI and dimension scores effectively separated the eight speakers into distinct clusters and along a clear spectrum of civic character. The ability to distinguish between the highly virtuous rhetoric of John McCain and the highly vicious rhetoric of Steve King, while also placing others at nuanced points in between, is a key strength.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CAF's dimensions appear well-suited to analyzing this corpus of American political speech. All ten dimensions were present in the data, and their relationships largely conformed to the framework's theoretical expectations. The derived metrics, particularly the CCI and Tension Indices, proved to be insightful for summarizing and interpreting the results.
*   **Methodological Insights and Limitations:** The analysis highlights the power of combining dimensional scores into higher-order metrics. However, it also underscores the critical importance of corpus metadata. The inability to perform the `validate_framework_by_style` analysis because of a missing manifest is a significant finding in itself. It demonstrates that for computational frameworks to reach their full potential, the underlying data must be richly annotated. Future research using the CAF should prioritize the development of corpora with detailed metadata on speaker ideology, rhetorical context, and communication style.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this analysis, while preliminary, have several important implications for the study of political communication and the utility of the Civic Analysis Framework.

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

This study suggests that "civic character," as conceptualized by the CAF, is a quantifiable feature of political discourse. The strong clustering of virtues and vices into two opposing camps lends empirical weight to the idea that political rhetoric often aligns with one of two meta-strategies: a constructive, unifying approach or a divisive, pathological one. The first seeks to build consensus through appeals to shared dignity, truth, and pragmatic problem-solving. The second seeks to mobilize support by creating in-groups, assigning blame, and simplifying complex realities.

The nuanced finding regarding the Justice/Resentment axis is theoretically significant. It suggests that while most virtues and vices are mutually exclusive rhetorical choices, the pursuit of justice can be rhetorically intertwined with the language of resentment. This may indicate that resentment is not merely a pathological vice but can be a powerful, and perhaps sometimes necessary, tool for mobilizing constituencies against perceived injustices. This complicates a simple binary view of civic discourse and points toward a more complex model where certain vices can be strategically deployed in the service of what are framed as virtuous ends.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The classification of speakers into rhetorical archetypes is a key contribution of this analysis. The "Authentic Virtue" archetype (McCain, Booker, Romney) represents a style of discourse often associated with institutionalism and statesmanship, characterized by appeals to unity, responsibility, and pragmatism. The textual evidence from John McCain's concession speech, with its focus on national unity and graciousness in defeat, is a textbook example of this style. As John McCain stated: **"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

Conversely, the "Strategic Pathology" archetype (King, Sanders) aligns closely with populist rhetorical strategies. This style is defined by its reliance on `tribalism` (the people vs. the elite/other), `resentment` (grievances against the system), and often `fantasy` (oversimplification of problems and solutions). The rhetoric of Bernie Sanders, which frames politics as a struggle between the 99% and the 1%, is a clear example.

The speakers in the middle, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (CCI = 0.005), represent a hybrid or "mixed" rhetorical style. Her profile, with nearly equal measures of virtue and vice appeals, suggests a complex strategy that attempts to blend inspirational, hope-based messaging with the divisive, resentment-fueled critiques characteristic of populist movements.

### Broader Significance and Future Directions

If the patterns identified here are confirmed in larger studies, the CAF could serve as a valuable diagnostic tool for assessing the health of a political system's discourse. The ability to track the prevalence of these different rhetorical archetypes over time, across different media, or in response to different events could provide crucial insights into political polarization, democratic stability, and the quality of public deliberation.

The most pressing direction for future research is to apply the CAF to a large, diverse, and well-annotated corpus of texts. This would allow for more robust statistical analysis and the confirmation of the archetypes identified here. Specifically, researchers may wish to investigate:
*   How do these rhetorical patterns differ across platforms (e.g., Twitter vs. legislative speeches)?
*   Are there significant differences in civic character between political parties or ideologies that were not captured in this small sample?
*   How does the civic character of discourse change over the course of an election cycle or a politician's career?
*   Further exploration of the Justice/Resentment axis is needed to understand when and how these two appeals are combined.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, applying the Civic Analysis Framework v10.0 to a small corpus of political texts, has successfully demonstrated the framework's potential as a tool for the rigorous study of political discourse. The study identified a clear spectrum of civic character among the speakers, ranging from the "Authentic Virtue" of figures like John McCain to the "Strategic Pathology" of figures like Steve King and Bernie Sanders.

Methodologically, the analysis provided important preliminary validation for the framework's core theoretical constructs. The strong, statistically significant negative correlations between the framework's opposing virtues and vices suggest that the CAF is measuring coherent and meaningful patterns in language. The derived metrics, particularly the Civic Character Index and the Tension Indices, proved to be powerful tools for summarizing complex, multi-dimensional data into interpretable findings.

While the conclusions of this report must be tempered by the exploratory nature of the analysis and its small sample size, the findings are highly suggestive. They point to the existence of distinct, measurable, and competing rhetorical strategies in contemporary politics. This research provides a solid foundation and a clear set of testable hypotheses for future work. By scaling this analysis to larger datasets with richer metadata, computational social science can move towards a more systematic and empirically grounded understanding of the virtues and vices that shape our civic life.
