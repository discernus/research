      "description": "The framework's human-readable title 'Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0' suggests version 10.0, but the machine-readable metadata in the appendix specifies `framework_version: \"1.0.0\"`. While the functionally critical `spec_version: \"10.0\"` is correct, this discrepancy could be confusing.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency does not block execution but may cause confusion for researchers regarding the framework's versioning and provenance.",
      "fix": "To improve clarity and consistency, update the `framework_version` field in the `framework.md` YAML appendix to '10.0.0' to align with the version number used in the document's prose.",
