I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character.\",\n  \"We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\",\n  \"I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.\",\n  \"Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\",\n  \"I sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\",\n  \"I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.\",\n  \"Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\",\n  \"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\",\n  \"I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president... would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\",\n  \"Were I to ignore the evidence... it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\",\n  \"I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters.\",\n  \"I hope we respect each other's good faith.\",\n  \"I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character.\",\n  \"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\",\n  \"The historic meaning of the words \\\"high crimes and misdemeanors,\\\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office.\",\n  \"While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president.\",\n  \"I acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate.\"\n]\nTotal quotes in analysis result: 22\nTotal quotes in output: 22",
