Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country.]\",\n  \"[the leader of the Republican party is a guy who actually plans to put American citizens first, and that's Donald Trump.]\",\n  \"[America is a nation. It is a group of people with a common history and a common future.]\",\n  \"[many of them are very good people. But my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country.]\",\n  \"[Seven generations of people who have fought for this country, who have built this country, who have made things in this country and who would fight and die to protect this country if they were asked to.]\",\n  \"[It would be, you, the, the equivalent of allowing the Nazi Germans in 1942 to make all of our ships and missiles.]\",\n  \"[Why don't our elites seem to care about it? Well, number one, they really benefit from the cheap labor. Okay? Number two, they actually don't really like the people who make up the domestic populations of their own country.]\",\n  \"[The only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here, according to the Biden administration. They're the people. They're the people, by the way, who are not allowed to have an opinion about what's going on in their country because they will be silenced. They will be censored. They will be called every name in the book.]\",\n  \"[The argument is that, yeah, maybe immigrants take up some more demand for housing, but they, they build all the houses. That's not true, by the way.]\",\n  \"[The only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here, according to the Biden administration.]\",\n  \"[But as much as our leaders have forgotten that and as much as I think that the most significant example of that is, is in Ukraine, uh, where we have sent hundreds of billions of dollars of weaponry with no obvious end in sight...]\",\n  \"[The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more. That is the threat to American democracy.]\",\n  \"[A third, I heard this yesterday, a third of the local County Health budget is now tied up in giving free benefits to illegal immigrants.]\",\n  \"[Those people can still do it. They just want to get proper wages in the process.]\",\n  \"[Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country.]\",\n  \"[It doesn't make any sense. It's sort of the perfect encapsulation of the dumbest way to govern our country. Let's send our entire machinery for making war to countries that hate us and then let's spend what little stockpiles that we have on a war that has no obvious end in sight.]\",\n  \"[no one can avoid that it has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced.]\",\n  \"[Springfield, Ohio, has been overwhelmed. And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people. But my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country.]\",\n  \"[But I will say on the good news, the majority of the Republican house and the majority of the Republican Senate, the most recent cycle, said no more to this, no more, right? That's a good thing, that's progress.]\",\n  \"[the national conservative movement is winning the debate and we're changing the conversation. We're doing that and the very, very basic and simple principle that American leaders should look out for Americans.]\",\n  \"[The reason I'm most optimistic about the future of this movement and the future of our country is because for the first time in a very long time, it is clear that the leader of the Republican party is not some donor... The leader of the Republican party is a guy who actually plans to put American citizens first, and that's Donald Trump.]\",\n  \"[America is a nation. It is a group of people with a common history and a common future.]\",\n  \"[The only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here, according to the Biden administration.]\",\n  \"[Let's get to work to make that happen. God bless you guys and thank you.]\",\n  \"[where we have sent hundreds of billions of dollars of weaponry with no obvious end in sight and no obvious conclusion or even objective that we're close to getting...]\",\n  \"[you can't have unlimited free trade with countries that hate you.]\",\n  \"[We're going to disagree sometimes about how best to serve that nation. We're going to disagree, of course, even within this room about how to best accomplish the reinvigoration of American industry and the renewal of American family. That's fine.]\"\n]\nTotal quotes in analysis result: 27\nTotal quotes in output: 27",
