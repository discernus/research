Let's stick with the tradition.'\",\n  \"This happens every day in this country. It happens hundreds of times in this country each year. These incidents of illegal aliens that are, that are arrested and turned loose on the street because the President has this idea of prioritization or prosecutorial discretion is costing lives in America. And it's costing, it's costing in the end thousands of lives in America.\",\n  \"Every American that dies at their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our laws.\",\n  \"That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally.\",\n  \"This was a hearing that had witnesses, um, a fine Sheriff Jenkins from Frederick County, Maryland, who has been enforcing immigration law, standing up for the rule of law. He's been prudently using the legal and justifiable, uh, evidence that he had before him, and he's been criticized for his effectiveness by the people that don't want to enforce the law.\",\n  \"And then the perpetrator, an illegal alien whom the law enforcement had encountered and released onto the streets of America, who had no business being in America in the first place, and whom law enforcement already had picked up at least once. This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body.\",\n  \"That's 135 dead Americans that would be alive today if the President didn't have the policy of releasing criminal, criminal aliens onto the streets.\",\n  \"However, the Senate determines what advice is and the Senate determines that which is consent. And no nomination to the federal court can move forward without the Senate's advice and consent. It's the Senate's job then to evaluate the nominations of the President. And they can do so with or without hearings, with or without interviews.\",\n  \"When here in our Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Article one of our Constitution says, 'All legislative power, power, all legislative, all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.' That's here. The House and the Senate.\",\n  \"This President has, has released over 30,000 criminals, criminal aliens onto the streets of America. And of those that they released, there have been at least 124 of them who have been charged with homicide for 135 murders.\",\n  \"We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that the Constitution means what they want it to mean and they want to read it uh to say what they want it to say rather than what it actually says and rather than what it actually was understood to mean at the time of its ratification.\",\n  \"He's demonstrated that in the past with his appointments to the court. He will demonstrate that again. We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend. And so our obligation then is to say, 'Mr. President, you're lame duck.'\",\n  \"Sarah Root would be alive today if the President had done his job, if law enforcement had been allowed to do their job, if ICE had responded when local law enforcement called them.\",\n  \"we here who take an oath to support and defend the Constitution\u2014and that's actually all of us here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, and everyone in the United States Senate for that matter\u2014we recognize that if we're going to support and defend the Constitution, encouraging the, the nomination and the advice and the consent, the confirmation of the Senate and encouraging then a presidential appointment to the Supreme Court of someone whom the President is incapable of nominating anyone to the Supreme Court that what the Constitution says and what was understood to mean at the time of its ratification\",\n  \"That is the constitutional structure of this government that we have, Mr. Speaker\",\n  \"I want an expectation that when the law is broken in the United States, that there's going to be an enforcement, that it'll be applied equally without regard to any of these categories that the President encourages us to be members of. That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally. Secure our borders. Restore their respect for the rule of law. Save these lives. Send these people into prison. And when they're done, send them back to the country that they can live in legally\",\n  \"We have a Constitution that's got to be restored. And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment.\",\n  \"And it bring you to a sad state of mourn. And you'd lay your head down on the pillow at night having trouble to sleep, thinking, 'What am I going to do tomorrow? I couldn't react today. What am I going to do tomorrow? Lord, wake me up with an idea on how to, how to preserve our Constitution,' if the Supreme Court of the United States believes that they can write law.\",\n  \"This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body... It's another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America... is costing lives in America. And it's costing, it's costing in the end thousands of lives in America.\",\n  \"I was hopeful that I would wake up with an idea and how to address the Supreme Court that's overreached\",\n  \"I thank God for Laura Wilkerson and I ask God to bless the life and the memory and the soul of Joshua Wilkerson who has paid a tremendously high price because we have an ideological president who, I'd say to the other side of the aisle, who's not doing his job.\",\n  \"Every American that dies at their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our laws.\",\n  \"If the states want to establish same-sex marriage, so be it. That's a voice of the people. It's constitutional and it fits the structure of our our United States Constitution along with the various state constitutions and the structure of the rule of law.\",\n  \"You have to remand it back to Congress and tell us this is what the law says. So therefore, if Congress wants the law to say something different, we have to amend it here in the House and the Senate and get a presidential signature on it. That is the constitutional structure of this government that we have\",\n  \"It has to be on an individual basis only. And that's by the words of the former Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, who testified before the Judiciary Committee to that extent.\"\n]\nTotal number of quotes in the composite analysis: 26\nTotal number of quotes in your output: 26",
