# Document Analysis - Marked Up Text

**Context**: Economic policy speech from 2020s

The [TRIBALISM: American people] [RESENTMENT: are outraged] at what's going on, and the [TRIBALISM: American people] are saying loud and clear, ['WE_WILL_NOT_ACCEPT: We will not accept] an [FEAR: oligarchic form of society]. [JUSTICE: We will not accept an oligarchic form of society.] [TRIBALISM: We will not accept] the [TRIBALISM: richest guy in the world] running all over Washington, [FEAR: making cuts to the Social Security Administration, cuts to the Veterans Administration, almost destroying the Department of Education], all so that [TRIBALISM: they could give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1%].

[TRUTH: Today you have more concentration of ownership in America than we have ever had in the history of this country in sector after sector], whether it is agriculture, transportation, media, financial services, what you have is a [TRIBALISM: small number of extraordinarily large corporations] who [RESENTMENT: charge us outrageous prices for the products that we have to buy].

[TRUTH: Today you've got three Wall Street firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. Combined, these three investment firms are the majority stockholders in 95% of American corporations.] [TRIBALISM: These guys], [MANIPULATION: I want to tell you something because I bump into them in my line of work, they are not nice guys.] [MANIPULATION: I know on TV they come across... And in your community, they make a donation to the hospital or the Boys & Girls Clubs or the food shelf. They're just very nice. But they're not.]

In America today, as I think all of you know, sadly and tragically, and we've got to deal with it, we have [FEAR: major epidemics dealing with addiction]. [TRUTH: I think we lost a hundred thousand Americans last year because of drug overdose.] It's a serious problem in my state. [FEAR: We have people addicted to alcohol, serious problems with alcoholism.] [FEAR: We have people who were addicted to tobacco.] My father smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and he died before he was 60. [FEAR: People addicted to food.] But I will tell you this, in the midst of all of these addictions, the [FEAR: worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs]. [TRIBALISM: the greed of the oligarchs]. [MANIPULATION: the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs].

Now [DIGNITY: everybody wants to do well in life. Everybody wants to make money.] But you would think that if you had a few billion dollars or $10 or $20 billion, you would not feel obliged to [RESENTMENT: step on the backs of poor people] to become even richer. But that is exactly what [TRIBALISM: they are doing] right now. [FEAR: They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration] [JUSTICE: They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration] in order to make [TRIBALISM: themselves even richer].

[TRIBALISM: These guys] have no sense of what goes on in the real world. [TRIBALISM: They live in another planet.] [TRIBALISM: They own mansions all over the world.] [TRIBALISM: They go on vacations to their own private islands.] When [TRIBALISM: they want to go someplace], they don't go into their car. [TRIBALISM: They go into the planes or the helicopters that they own.] [TRIBALISM: Send their kids to the best private schools and colleges.] [TRIBALISM: That is their world.]

[JUSTICE: Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people.] Well, [TRIBALISM: Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires.]

And what [TRIBALISM: these guys] are busy doing right now is going after Medicaid, going after Social Security, going after nutrition. [TRIBALISM: The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on.] [RESENTMENT: The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on.]

[RESENTMENT: You know why the American people are angry and they are angry all over this country?] [PRAGMATISM: They are angry because, believe it or not, despite a huge increase in worker productivity over the last 52 years, if you could believe it, real inflation accounted for wages today are lower than they were 52 years ago.] [TRUTH: real inflation accounted for wages today are lower than they were 52 years ago.] Meanwhile, [TRUTH: there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%.] [RESENTMENT: That is what a rigged economy is about], and [HOPE: that is what we are going to change.]

You got a President Trump getting inaugurated. And I must tell you one of the more bizarre experiences of my life was I was kind of pushed into the front row of that. And there I am, there's Trump, and right behind him, you got [TRIBALISM: Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg, three wealthiest guys in the country.] And then behind them, you got [TRIBALISM: 13 other billionaires who Trump nominated to head up various government agencies.]

I don't care if you are a Republican, Democrat, or independent, I don't think there's anybody who thinks it vaguely makes sense that the [TRIBALISM: richest guy in the world] could spend $270 million to get Trump elected and then become the most powerful person in the government. That's not just Republicans. Let's be clear. [RESENTMENT: Billionaires are funding the Democratic Party and preventing that party from standing up for working families.] [TRIBALISM: Billionaires are funding the Democratic Party and preventing that party from standing up for working families.]

[PRAGMATISM: I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%.] So [HOPE: if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve.] [FANTASY: if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve.]
