# Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0

---

## Part 1: The Scholarly Document

### Section 1: Abstract & *Raison d'Ãªtre*

**What is this framework?**
The Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) is a systematic measurement methodology for quantifying civic virtue and vice patterns in political discourse. Based on Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory, this framework provides empirical data about textual patterns that theoretical frameworks associate with civic character, focusing on the tensions between competing moral appeals.

**What problem does it solve?**
Democratic governance depends on civic discourse that embodies fundamental virtues. However, systematic measurement of virtue and vice patterns in political communication has been fragmented and inconsistent. This framework provides reliable, replicable measurements of civic virtue appeals and strategic moral tensions that researchers can use to study relationships between discourse patterns and civic character.

**What it enables:**
These measurements provide empirical foundation for research examining relationships between discourse patterns and civic character assessment, moral positioning, or democratic discourse quality. Researchers integrate CAF data with virtue ethics theory, contextual knowledge, and additional sources to construct analytical arguments about civic implications.

**What it doesn't do:**
The framework measures observable textual features related to civic virtues and vices but does not assess actual speaker character, predict moral behavior, or determine fitness for office. Such assessments require moral philosophy expertise, character evidence, and domain-specific theoretical frameworks.

**Who is it for:**
This framework is designed for political philosophers, civic education researchers, and policy analysts who need reliable empirical measurements of civic virtue patterns in political discourse. It serves as methodological infrastructure for studies of civic character, moral positioning, and democratic discourse analysis.

### Section 2: Theoretical & Empirical Foundations

The CAF is grounded in a multi-disciplinary body of research from political philosophy, virtue ethics, and political communication theory.

#### **Aristotelian Virtue Ethics in a Political Context**
Drawing from Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*, CAF recognizes that excellence in public life depends on the cultivation of specific virtues and the habitual avoidance of corresponding vices. Political leadership requires not merely policy competence but demonstrated moral character worthy of democratic trust. The framework operationalizes this by measuring the observable rhetorical habits of speakers.

**Core Principle**: Character is revealed through choices under pressure. How leaders communicate when facing political challenges reveals their fundamental moral orientation.

#### **Civic Republican Character Theory**
Building on contemporary scholarship by figures like Michael Sandel and Philip Pettit, CAF examines how speakers either embody the civic virtues necessary for democratic leadership or display vices that undermine their fitness for public trust.

**Key Insight**: Democratic governance depends on leaders who prioritize universal principles over narrow interests, demonstrate intellectual integrity, and maintain commitment to democratic norms even when politically costly.

#### **The Importance of Salience Weighting**
A core innovation of the v10 specification is the distinction between a dimension's **intensity** (its raw 0.0-1.0 score) and its **salience** (its rhetorical prominence or emphasis, also 0.0-1.0). This is empirically grounded in research showing that context-dependent weighting based on textual emphasis provides more accurate results than fixed weighting schemes (Laver et al., 2003). By analyzing both intensity and salience, CAF captures not just *what* is being said, but *how much emphasis* it receives, providing a more nuanced and valid assessment.

### Section 3: Measurement Methodology

CAF quantifies political discourse across five bipolar axes that capture fundamental patterns in civic discourse. Each of the ten dimensions is scored independently for both intensity (raw_score) and rhetorical prominence (salience).

**Dimensions & Axes**:

**Identity Axis**: 
-   **Tribalism** (0.0-1.0): Group loyalty over universal principles, us-vs-them framing.
-   **Dignity** (0.0-1.0): Respect for universal human worth, emphasis on shared humanity.

**Truth Axis**:
-   **Manipulation** (0.0-1.0): Strategic distortion of information, emotional manipulation.
-   **Truth** (0.0-1.0): Commitment to factual accuracy, intellectual honesty.

**Justice Axis**:
-   **Resentment** (0.0-1.0): Exploitation of grievances, blame-focused rhetoric.
-   **Justice** (0.0-1.0): Concern for fair outcomes, procedural fairness.

**Emotional Axis**:
-   **Fear** (0.0-1.0): Anxiety-inducing rhetoric, threat-focused language.
-   **Hope** (0.0-1.0): Constructive optimism, positive vision for the future.

**Reality Axis**:
-   **Fantasy** (0.0-1.0): Unrealistic promises, magical thinking, oversimplified solutions.
-   **Pragmatism** (0.0-1.0): Realistic problem-solving, acknowledgment of constraints.

**Measurement Pattern Classifications**
The framework provides data that enables researchers to identify interpretive patterns in civic discourse. These patterns emerge from the relationships between dimensional scores and salience.
- **Virtue Emphasis**: High scores and high salience for virtue dimensions, indicating textual commitment to civic ideals.
- **Surface Virtue Appeals**: High scores but low salience for virtue dimensions, suggesting brief appeals without sustained emphasis.
- **Vice Emphasis**: High scores and high salience for vice dimensions, indicating sustained deployment of divisive or manipulative rhetorical patterns.
- **Strategic Contradictions**: High tension scores between opposing dimensions, indicating inconsistent or contradictory value appeals.

**Derived & Composite Metrics**:

**Character Tension Indices** (0.0-1.0, higher = more contradiction):
These metrics, restored from CAF v5.0, quantify the strategic contradictions in a speaker's rhetoric. They are now salience-weighted to reflect the prominence of the competing appeals.
- **Formula**: `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`
- **Indices**: `identity_tension`, `truth_tension`, `justice_tension`, `emotional_tension`, `reality_tension`.

**Salience-Weighted Civic Discourse Index** (-1.0 to +1.0, negative = vice-dominant, positive = virtue-dominant):
This is the primary summary metric, measuring the overall civic discourse orientation. It weights each dimension by its rhetorical prominence.
- **Formula**: The sum of all (Virtue Score * Virtue Salience) minus the sum of all (Vice Score * Vice Salience), normalized by the total salience of all dimensions. This ensures that the most emphasized themes have the greatest impact on the final discourse measurement.

**Sequential Measurement Strategy**:
For highest fidelity measurement, it is recommended to run the five sequential analysis variants (sequential_identity, sequential_truth, sequential_justice, sequential_emotional, sequential_reality) and combine the results. This approach allows the measurement agent to focus exclusively on one axis at a time, reducing cognitive load and improving scoring accuracy. The combined results provide a comprehensive civic discourse profile with enhanced reliability.

**Concept Overlap Resolution**:
The framework addresses the inherent complexity of political discourse where speakers may simultaneously appeal to competing values. Each dimension includes explicit disambiguation rules to guide consistent scoring when conceptual overlap occurs:

- **Identity Axis**: When statements refer to in-group dignity (e.g., "respect for our citizens"), the agent assesses whether the primary function is to create exclusionary contrast (Tribalism) or emphasize universal worth (Dignity). Both can be scored if clearly present.

- **Truth Axis**: Distinguishes between strategic deception (Manipulation) and genuine intellectual honesty (Truth). A statement can be factually correct but manipulative if framed deceptively.

- **Justice Axis**: Separates punitive blame-focus (Resentment) from restorative fairness (Justice). Both may use "fairness" language, so the agent evaluates temporal focus and intent.

- **Emotional Axis**: Allows independent scoring of Fear and Hope, recognizing that speakers can simultaneously warn of threats while offering positive vision.

- **Reality Axis**: Distinguishes between acknowledging constraints (Pragmatism) and denying complexity (Fantasy). Bold plans are Hope, not Fantasy, if grounded in plausible achievement paths.

This systematic approach ensures that the framework captures the full complexity of political rhetoric while maintaining scoring consistency and reliability.

**Machine-Readable Implementation**: The YAML appendix uses structured object formats to enhance LLM agent performance:

- **Enhanced Markers**: Each dimension's `markers` section uses `{ phrase: "...", explanation: "..." }` objects instead of simple lists. This provides context for each example, helping agents understand why specific phrases indicate particular dimensions.

- **Structured Disambiguation**: The `disambiguation` sections use nested objects with `rule`, `context_clues`, `priority`, and `co_occurrence_strategy` keys. This formal structure reduces ambiguity and ensures consistent agent interpretation of complex conceptual overlaps.

These structured formats exceed the base specification requirements but significantly improve scoring accuracy and reliability by providing explicit guidance for boundary cases and concept resolution.

### Section 4: Intended Application & Corpus Fit

-   **Target Corpus Description**: CAF is designed for the analysis of persuasive or strategic communication where a speaker's character is a central element, such as political speeches, candidate debates, and public statements.
-   **Known Limitations & Scope**: The framework is less suited for analyzing purely informational texts, policy documents, or artistic works. It requires a text where a speaker is actively making choices that reveal their moral and civic orientation.
-   **Model Requirements**: This framework requires a highly capable LLM model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) for reliable analysis due to the nuanced distinctions between dimensions and the dual-track intensity/salience scoring.
-   **System Validation Note**: Be aware that the Discernus platform will perform a post-hoc statistical analysis of your framework's fit with your chosen corpus based on the variance in the results. A low framework-corpus fit score may indicate that the framework was misapplied and could impact the interpretation of the results.

    analysis_prompt: |
      You are an expert analyst of civic character and political ethics, grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. Your task is to analyze the provided text using the Civic Analysis Framework v10.0.

      FRAMEWORK METHODOLOGY:
      This framework evaluates civic virtues and vices speakers demonstrate through rhetorical choices. It preserves complexity by independently scoring opposing dimensions for both intensity (raw_score) and rhetorical prominence (salience).

      DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS:
      You must evaluate 10 dimensions across 5 opposing pairs:
      - Identity: Tribalism vs. Dignity
      - Truth: Manipulation vs. Truth
      - Justice: Resentment vs. Justice
      - Emotional: Fear vs. Hope
      - Reality: Fantasy vs. Pragmatism

      EVIDENCE STANDARDS:
      - Provide exact quotations, not paraphrases.
      - Prioritize direct rhetorical indicators over interpretive inferences.
      - If evidence is ambiguous, lower the confidence score.

      SALIENCE ASSESSMENT: 
      Salience measures rhetorical prominence, not intensity. Consider:
      - Frequency and repetition patterns throughout the text
      - Structural positioning (opening, closing, thesis statements)
      - Thematic centrality to the overall message
      - Rhetorical devices used for emphasis (metaphors, imagery, emotional appeals)
      SALIENCE â  INTENSITY. A dimension can have moderate intensity (0.5) but high salience (0.9) if it's rhetorically central.

      LLM GUIDANCE:
      - Avoid anchoring bias from example scores in the markers section
      - Adhere strictly to the provided disambiguation rules to prevent concept conflation
      - Base scores on textual evidence, not inference or assumptions
      - Score each dimension independently; opposing dimensions can both be present
      - Use the boundary_cases guidance to resolve ambiguous phrases

      **CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION**: When statements refer to "our people" or "our citizens":
      - If primary function is creating exclusionary contrast â score as Tribalism
      - If primary function is emphasizing inherent worth â score as Dignity  
      - If both present, score both independently and note tension
      
      **BOUNDARY CASES**:
      - "We are a special people" â assess context for superiority vs. pride
      - "Respect for our citizens" â assess for exclusionary vs. universal worth emphasis

      - Justice: forward-looking, restorative focus on systems
      - Temporal orientation and intent are key differentiators
      
      **BOUNDARY CASES**:
      - "They must be held accountable" â punitive blame (Resentment) vs. restorative fairness (Justice)
      - "Restoring order" â legitimate goal (Justice) vs. pretext for suppression

      - Fear focuses on preventing negative future (threat prevention)
      - Hope focuses on achieving positive future (positive vision)
      - A statement can contain both aspects; score independently
      - Hope requires proactive, possibility-focused language (not just fear reduction)
      
      **BOUNDARY CASES**:
      - "A dangerous path" â legitimate warning (Pragmatism) vs. fear appeal
      - "A new American dream" â genuine hope vs. simple reassurance (fear reduction without positive vision)
