And that is when [RESENTMENT: those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price]. And [PRAGMATISM: our political system is ill-prepared for this abuse of power]. In fact, [PRAGMATISM: much of our political system enables it, starting with the role of money in politics].\\n\\nThe [RESENTMENT: same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country] and they derive their power from [MANIPULATION: dividing working people apart]. [MANIPULATION: They specialize in getting us to turn on one another] and [TRIBALISM: they get us to turn on one another along lines of left and right, race and gender, creed and culture]. [MANIPULATION: They'll throw out every label and judgment and cultural debate in the book to keep us distracted] because the last thing they want us to realize is that the division that is actually hurting our country the most is how [RESENTMENT: endless greed is costing the lives of everyone else].\\n\\n[MANIPULATION: They want us to think that our lives are suffering because of the LGBT kid down the street or because of the mixed status family or the dreamer down the block who's just trying to make a better life for themselves]. But [TRUTH: we're smarter than that Greeley. We know better than that].\\n\\nAnd I understand that this kind of [RESENTMENT: disdain that the wealthiest, wealthiest people in this country have for the working class] doesn't just come from them not being raised right. [MANIPULATION: It's shorthand for the right wing's entire political agenda and a certain ugly kind of politics, a politics that involves lying to and screwing over working and middle class Americans] so that they can [RESENTMENT: steal from our healthcare, Social Security, and veterans' benefits] to pay for [RESENTMENT: tax cuts for the wealthiest and bailouts for their crypto billionaire friends]. And Greeley, there's a word for this kind of thing, [RESENTMENT: corruption].\\n\\nDonald Trump does see the [FEAR: immense pressure that working people are under]. But his answer is an America that operates on the principle of every man for himself, [TRIBALISM: divide and conquer]. And now that Trump is back in power, we see it clear as day. [RESENTMENT: He's handed the keys to Elon Musk and is selling off our country for parts to the wealthiest people in the world for a kickback]. And in exchange, [RESENTMENT: those billionaires and oligarchs will back his campaigns and bankroll those of his allies]. [RESENTMENT: They scratch his back and he scratches theirs]. And [RESENTMENT: all of us are left behind].\\n\\nAnd the [MANIPULATION: clever thing that these guys sell is making working people like you and me believe that we're just one step outside from that club, that we're just a little bit out from being able to be a billionaire too]. [FANTASY: Any billionaires in this room? I didn't think so].\\n\\nNow it's this idea that [FANTASY: if we just work hard, we too can have nation-state level money], except [RESENTMENT: these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me].\\n\\nJust look at what Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing to [FEAR: our healthcare, our veterans' benefits, and Social Security]. They are [FEAR: slashing programs that we and you have spent a lifetime paying into]. And by the way, not them, because [JUSTICE: those billionaires haven't paid their fair share of taxes in years].\\n\\nAnd let's talk about Medicaid and Medicare for a second because your representative, Dave Evans, you know that guy that hasn't been showing up for the last couple months? Maybe he hasn't been showing up because [RESENTMENT: he voted to cut Medicaid].\\n\\nIn fact, [RESENTMENT: every single House Republican voted to cut Medicaid] and [MANIPULATION: they'll tell you, \\\"No, I didn't. I didn't say that,\\\"] but [TRUTH: here's what it is. They voted on a budget that cuts $880 billion from the committee that's in charge of Medicaid. And so now they're trying to play a game and say, \\\"We didn't do that,\\\" because they did by proxy]. So [TRUTH: let's set the record straight].\\n\\n[MANIPULATION: Mass media and Fox News, and the right well have you believe that these American values are something out of the Communist Manifesto]. [MANIPULATION: They believe that we think these things, because we went to some fancy college and read them in a book somewhere]. But [TRUTH: I'll tell you, I don't believe in healthcare, labor and human dignity, because I'm an extremist or a Marxist. I believe it because I was a waitress, because I've scrubbed toilets with my mom to afford school, because I've worked double shifts to keep the lights on, because I lost my dad to cancer as a kid and had to see my mom open hospital bills in the days after]. And [HOPE: I don't want us to live like this anymore, Greeley].\\n\\nThis isn't just about Republicans. [PRAGMATISM: We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us too]. But, Greeley, that means [PRAGMATISM: our communities choosing and voting for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class].\\n\\nYou know which Coloradans did vote to gut Medicaid and jack up healthcare costs? [RESENTMENT: Gabe Evans and Lauren Boebert right next door]. So folks, you know what that means, right? [HOPE: We need to come together] and [PRAGMATISM: spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors, and give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat who will stand for Colorado].\\n\\nSo to all of those who came here today, unsure of whether this is where you belong, I want to tell you that [DIGNITY: you do. You do. Honestly, no matter who you voted for in the past. No matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender identity, or status, no matter if you disagree with me on a couple of things]. [DIGNITY: If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here].\\n\\n[DIGNITY: If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here]. But I will say this, [TRIBALISM: those leaders on either side of the aisle who are willing to put their fellow Americans down], so that they can get ahead or feel better about themselves, [TRIBALISM: those folks may best find a home somewhere else]. Because [HOPE: in this house, we stand together], [HOPE: we know that, that it's our only choice because we know that without exception, if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win].\\n\\nSo [HOPE: I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity].\\n\\nIt's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, \\\"[DIGNITY: Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect].\\\"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
