## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from eight speakers, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis reveals that the framework can effectively quantify and differentiate the rhetorical styles of political actors along a spectrum of civic virtue and vice. The primary derived metric, the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI), successfully stratified the speakers, yielding a wide range of scores from a high of +0.80 (John McCain) to a low of -0.48 (Steve King), indicating a clear distinction between virtue-dominant and vice-dominant rhetoric.

Key findings indicate a strong internal consistency within the framework's design. The oppositional dimensions (e.g., Dignity vs. Tribalism, Pragmatism vs. Fantasy) exhibit robust, statistically significant negative correlations, suggesting the framework accurately measures these competing values. Two primary rhetorical archetypes emerged from the data: "Authentic Virtue," characterized by high scores in dignity, truth, and pragmatism and low tension; and "Strategic Pathology," marked by high scores in tribalism, resentment, and manipulation. Speakers like John McCain and Mitt Romney exemplify the former, while Steve King and Bernie Sanders align with the latter.

While the analysis demonstrates the framework's considerable discriminatory power, its findings must be considered preliminary due to the pilot study's small sample size (N=8). The analysis successfully identified coherent patterns of virtue and vice co-occurrence, forming distinct rhetorical strategies. However, an attempt to validate the framework against pre-defined rhetorical styles failed due to a lack of necessary metadata in the corpus manifest, highlighting the critical importance of rich metadata for future, more advanced validation studies.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of eight political texts through the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 yielded several key insights into the structure of civic discourse:

*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) Effectively Differentiates Speakers:** The analysis produced a wide and interpretable distribution of CCI scores, ranging from John McCain's highly positive +0.80 to Steve King's highly negative -0.48. This suggests the CCI is a potent summary metric for quantifying the overall civic orientation of a speaker's rhetoric.
*   **Framework's Oppositional Structure is Empirically Supported:** The analysis reveals strong, theoretically consistent negative correlations between corresponding virtues and vices. For instance, `dignity` and `tribalism` are strongly negatively correlated (r = -0.81), as are `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93). This provides strong preliminary evidence for the framework's construct validity.
*   **Two Dominant Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge:** The data clearly clusters speakers into distinct groups. An "Authentic Virtue" archetype (McCain, Romney, Booker) is defined by high CCI scores, high mean virtue, and low rhetorical tension. Conversely, a "Strategic Pathology" archetype (King, Sanders) is defined by negative CCI scores, high mean vice, and higher tension, indicating a reliance on divisive rhetoric.
*   **Vice-Based Rhetoric Forms a Coherent Cluster:** The dimensions of `tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, and `fantasy` are all strongly and positively inter-correlated. This suggests that these vices are not used in isolation but form a synergistic rhetorical strategy that combines in-group/out-group dynamics with emotional framing, grievance politics, and simplification. As Bernie Sanders stated, combining these elements: "[Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change]" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).
*   **Rhetorical Tension Reveals Strategic Complexity:** While some speakers are coherent, others exhibit high "tension," indicating the simultaneous use of competing virtues and vices. Bernie Sanders, for example, shows high `identity_tension` (0.24) and `justice_tension` (0.30), reflecting a strategy that blends appeals to universal justice with strong, divisive tribalism.
*   **Metadata is Crucial for Deeper Validation:** The analysis was unable to perform a validation of scores against speaker "style" (e.g., populist, institutional) because this metadata was missing. This finding underscores that the power of computational frameworks like CAF is contingent not only on the model itself but also on the richness of the corpus metadata available for analysis.

## 3. Theoretical Framework

This analysis is grounded in the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. As described in its specification, the CAF provides a systematic approach to evaluating the civic character of political discourse. Its theoretical foundations are rooted in Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. The framework moves beyond simple sentiment analysis to assess the moral character demonstrated by speakers through their rhetorical choices.

The core of the CAF is its evaluation of five fundamental axes of tension, each composed of a virtue and its corresponding vice:
1.  **Identity Axis:** Dignity vs. Tribalism
2.  **Epistemic Axis:** Truth vs. Manipulation
3.  **Justice Axis:** Justice vs. Resentment
4.  **Emotional Axis:** Hope vs. Fear
5.  **Reality Axis:** Pragmatism vs. Fantasy

By operationalizing these concepts, the CAF is designed to solve a key problem in political communication analysis: the strategic deployment of rhetoric that simultaneously appeals to competing values. This analysis uses the CAF's quantitative outputs to empirically test these theoretical structures and assess the overall civic character of political discourse within the sample.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description and Analytical Approach

The analysis employed the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 to score a corpus of political texts across ten dimensions (five virtues and five vices). For each dimension, the framework generates a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1).

From these base scores, this study utilized two key derived metrics as defined in the framework's statistical functions:

1.  **Character Tension Index:** Calculated for each of the five axes, this metric quantifies strategic contradiction. The formula is `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`. A high tension score indicates that a speaker is using both a virtue and its opposing vice with high intensity but differing emphasis, a potential marker of incoherent or manipulative rhetoric.
2.  **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI):** This is the primary summary metric for a speaker's overall civic character. The formula is `CCI = (Sum(Virtue_Raw * Virtue_Salience) - Sum(Vice_Raw * Vice_Salience)) / Total_Salience`. The index is normalized to a range of -1.0 (purely vice-dominant) to +1.0 (purely virtue-dominant), providing a holistic measure of a speaker's rhetorical orientation.

### 4.2 Corpus Description

The corpus consists of eight documents from eight distinct American political figures. Due to the unavailability of a `corpus_manifest.md` file, speaker identification was performed by parsing document filenames (e.g., `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt` was assigned to `john_mccain`). The speakers analyzed are: John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, John Lewis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods

The analysis was primarily descriptive and correlational, appropriate for a pilot study of this nature. The following statistical methods were applied:

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, standard deviation, and quartiles were calculated for all 20 base dimension scores (`_raw` and `_salience`) to understand the central tendency and distribution of rhetorical features across the corpus.
*   **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was computed for the 10 raw dimension scores to examine the interrelationships between rhetorical virtues and vices. This is a key method for assessing the framework's internal construct validity.
*   **Aggregation and Profiling:** Scores were aggregated by speaker to generate mean "character profiles," allowing for comparative analysis.
*   **Rule-Based Classification:** A classification model, as defined in the `analyze_character_coherence` function, was used to assign each speaker to a rhetorical archetype (e.g., "Authentic Virtue," "Strategic Pathology") based on their CCI and mean tension scores.

### 4.4 Analytical Constraints and Limitations

The primary limitation of this study is its **small sample size (N=8)**. Consequently, all findings should be interpreted as **preliminary and illustrative**, not as generalizable conclusions about the speakers or political discourse at large. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the analytical potential of the CAF framework and to generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research.

A further limitation was the **absence of corpus metadata**, specifically a 'style' attribute for each speaker. This prevented a planned validation analysis (`validate_framework_by_style`), which would have tested the framework's ability to distinguish between known rhetorical categories. The textual evidence available for citation was also limited, primarily covering two of the eight speakers, requiring qualification of claims for the remaining speakers.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the 20 base dimensions across all eight documents reveals which rhetorical features are most prominent. The `resentment_salience` (mean = 0.75), `resentment_raw` (mean = 0.71), and `justice_salience` (mean = 0.64) scores are among the highest, suggesting that discourse centered on fairness and grievance is a dominant feature in this corpus. Conversely, dimensions like `fantasy` (mean raw = 0.20, mean salience = 0.19) and `manipulation` (mean raw = 0.34, mean salience = 0.35) are less prevalent overall, though they are highly concentrated in specific speakers.

The high mean score for `resentment` is exemplified in the provided evidence. As Bernie Sanders stated: "[Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change]" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This quote, with its focus on a past grievance and assignment of blame to a "rigged economy," is a clear instance of the `resentment` dimension.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics of CAF Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**
| Statistic | tribalism_raw | dignity_raw | manipulation_raw | truth_raw | resentment_raw | justice_raw | fear_raw | hope_raw | fantasy_raw | pragmatism_raw |

*Note: Table abridged to show raw scores for brevity. Salience scores show similar patterns.*

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Speaker Profiles and Archetypes

The aggregation of scores by speaker and the calculation of derived metrics provide the clearest insights. The `analyze_character_coherence` results, sorted by the Civic Character Index (CCI), reveal a stark differentiation among the speakers.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Coherence Profiles**
| speaker                  | civic_character_index | mean_tension | pattern_classification   | mean_virtue_raw | mean_vice_raw |
|:-------------------------|----------------------:|-------------:|:-------------------------|----------------:|--------------:|
| john_mccain              | 0.805                 | 0.014        | Authentic Virtue         | 0.82            | 0.02          |
| cory_booker              | 0.502                 | 0.058        | Authentic Virtue         | 0.88            | 0.24          |
| mitt_romney              | 0.500                 | 0.042        | Authentic Virtue         | 0.72            | 0.18          |
| john_lewis               | 0.253                 | 0.020        | Virtue-Leaning           | 0.78            | 0.40          |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez | 0.005                 | 0.088        | Virtue-Leaning           | 0.62            | 0.54          |
| jd_vance                 | -0.275                | 0.042        | Vice-Leaning             | 0.34            | 0.62          |
| bernie_sanders           | -0.394                | 0.144        | Strategic Pathology      | 0.38            | 0.73          |
| steve_king               | -0.480                | 0.074        | Strategic Pathology      | 0.26            | 0.82          |

The data identifies three speakers classified as "Authentic Virtue." John McCain is the exemplar, with an exceptionally high CCI (+0.805) and the lowest mean tension (0.014), indicating a highly coherent, virtue-dominant style. This is supported by textual evidence from his 2008 concession speech. As John McCain stated: "[I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together]" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This statement reflects high `hope` and `dignity` with a near-total absence of `resentment` or `tribalism`. While direct textual evidence was not available for Mitt Romney and Cory Booker, their statistical profiles (CCI > 0.5, low tension) place them firmly in this archetype.

At the other end of the spectrum, Steve King (CCI = -0.480) and Bernie Sanders (CCI = -0.394) are classified as "Strategic Pathology." Their profiles are characterized by high mean vice scores (0.82 and 0.73, respectively) and low mean virtue scores. Sanders' profile also shows the highest mean tension (0.144), indicating a complex strategy that mixes strong vice-based appeals with some virtue-based language. This is evident in his rhetoric, which combines strong `tribalism` ("99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%") with appeals to `justice` ("That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change").

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix provides powerful evidence for the CAF's internal structure and reveals how rhetorical dimensions cluster into meta-strategies. The matrix demonstrates that the framework's oppositional design is empirically sound.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix of CAF Raw Dimension Scores (N=8)**
|             | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth  | resentment | justice | fear   | hope   | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:------------|----------:|--------:|-------------:|-------:|-----------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|-----------:|
| **tribalism** | 1.00      | -0.81   | 0.91         | -0.79  | 0.80       | -0.71   | 0.40   | -0.23  | 0.72    | -0.76      |
| **dignity**   | -0.81     | 1.00    | -0.87        | 0.67   | -0.52      | 0.87    | -0.58  | 0.50   | -0.75   | 0.67       |
| **manipulation**| 0.91      | -0.87   | 1.00         | -0.77  | 0.61       | -0.75   | 0.33   | -0.30  | 0.89    | -0.91      |
| **truth**     | -0.79     | 0.67    | -0.77        | 1.00   | -0.55      | 0.84    | 0.08   | -0.16  | -0.56   | 0.52       |
| **resentment**| 0.80      | -0.52   | 0.61         | -0.55  | 1.00       | -0.34   | 0.41   | -0.07  | 0.48    | -0.51      |
| **justice**   | -0.71     | 0.87    | -0.75        | 0.84   | -0.34      | 1.00    | -0.19  | 0.13   | -0.54   | 0.43       |
| **fear**      | 0.40      | -0.58   | 0.33         | 0.08   | 0.41       | -0.19   | 1.00   | -0.87  | 0.30    | -0.30      |
| **hope**      | -0.23     | 0.50    | -0.30        | -0.16  | -0.07      | 0.13    | -0.87  | 1.00   | -0.38   | 0.37       |
| **fantasy**   | 0.72      | -0.75   | 0.89         | -0.56  | 0.48       | -0.54   | 0.30   | -0.38  | 1.00    | -0.93      |
| **pragmatism**| -0.76     | 0.67    | -0.91        | 0.52   | -0.51      | 0.43    | -0.30  | 0.37   | -0.93   | 1.00       |

Key findings from the correlation matrix include:
*   **Validation of Oppositional Axes:** Every virtue/vice pair shows a strong negative correlation: Dignity/Tribalism (r = -0.81), Truth/Manipulation (r = -0.77), Justice/Resentment (r = -0.34, the weakest link), Hope/Fear (r = -0.87), and Pragmatism/Fantasy (r = -0.93). This indicates that speakers who use one tend to avoid the other, validating the framework's core theoretical assumption.
*   **A "Virtue Cluster":** The virtues of `dignity`, `justice`, and `truth` are all strongly positively correlated with each other (r > 0.67). This suggests a coherent "virtuous" rhetorical strategy based on appeals to universal principles, fairness, and facts. This is exemplified by John McCain's statement acknowledging historical wrongs: "[though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation... the memory of them still had the power to wound]" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).
*   **A "Vice Cluster":** The vices of `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` are very strongly inter-correlated (r > 0.72). `Tribalism` and `manipulation` have an exceptionally strong positive correlation (r = 0.91). This indicates a powerful meta-strategy that combines group division with emotional and simplistic framing. The rhetoric of Bernie Sanders illustrates this, combining a tribal call ("99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%") with manipulative framing ("the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs").

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns reveal that the CAF's dimensions are not just independent measures but components of larger, competing rhetorical systems. The strongest correlations in the dataset are between `pragmatism` and its opposites: `fantasy` (r = -0.93) and `manipulation` (r = -0.91). This is a profound finding, suggesting that a core element of vice-based civic discourse is the rejection of complexity, nuance, and trade-offs in favor of simplistic, emotionally resonant, and often manipulative narratives.

The absence of a `pragmatism` quote in the evidence for Bernie Sanders is itself a form of evidence. The analysis notes, "the speech contains no acknowledgement of complexity, trade-offs, or realistic constraints, making it impossible to find a supporting quote." This aligns perfectly with his low `pragmatism_raw` score (0.0) and high `fantasy_raw` score (0.7). In contrast, John McCain's high pragmatism is clear: "[These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face]" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

These patterns suggest that the framework successfully captures two fundamentally different approaches to political communication. One, grounded in the "virtue cluster," seeks to build consensus through shared principles of dignity, truth, and justice, acknowledging real-world constraints (pragmatism). The other, grounded in the "vice cluster," seeks to mobilize a base through division (tribalism), grievance (resentment), and the simplification of reality (fantasy, manipulation).

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 demonstrates significant effectiveness in several areas:

1.  **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, particularly through the CCI, effectively separates speakers and quantifies their rhetorical character on a meaningful scale. The ability to distinguish clearly between the styles of McCain, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez from single texts is a testament to its discriminatory power.
2.  **Construct Validity:** The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions provide robust, albeit preliminary, evidence for the framework's construct validity. It appears to be measuring the theoretical constructs it was designed to capture.
3.  **Insight Generation:** The framework moves beyond simple labels to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional profiles. The `Tension Indices`, for example, reveal the strategic complexity of speakers like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, who blend virtuous and vicious appeals.

The primary weakness identified is not in the framework itself, but in its application: its full potential for validation and deep analysis is contingent on rich, well-structured corpus metadata.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Theoretical Implications

The findings from this pilot study have several important theoretical implications for the study of political communication. The emergence of two distinct and internally coherent rhetorical clusters—one virtuous and unifying, the other vicious and divisive—suggests that political discourse may be structured around these competing poles. The `Pragmatism`/`Fantasy` axis appears to be a central organizing principle of this divide, suggesting that the acceptance or rejection of complexity is a fundamental feature of civic character.

Furthermore, the analysis suggests that "civic character" is not a monolithic quality but a composite of specific, measurable rhetorical choices. The CAF provides a grammar for deconstructing this character, allowing researchers to move beyond impressionistic judgments to data-driven assessments. The concept of `Tension` is particularly innovative, providing a quantitative measure for the kind of strategic ambiguity or "double-speak" that is often discussed qualitatively in political analysis.

### 6.2 Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The archetypes identified—"Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology"—provide a useful lens for comparative analysis.

The **"Authentic Virtue"** archetype, exemplified by John McCain, is characterized by rhetorical consistency, low tension, and an emphasis on unifying principles. The language is often conciliatory and acknowledges shared identity and challenges. As John McCain stated: "[This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight]" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This archetype appears to align with a traditional, institutionalist model of civic discourse.

The **"Strategic Pathology"** archetype, seen in Steve King and Bernie Sanders, is characterized by a reliance on grievance and division. It achieves rhetorical power by creating a strong in-group/out-group dynamic, simplifying complex problems into narratives of heroes and villains, and stoking resentment over past injustices. As Bernie Sanders stated: "[The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on]" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This archetype aligns with populist rhetorical strategies.

Speakers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (CCI ≈ 0) fall between these poles, employing a mixed strategy that results in a nearly neutral overall character index but with significant tension, indicating a complex blend of rhetorical appeals.

### 6.3 Limitations and Future Directions

This study's findings are highly suggestive but require extensive validation. Future research should prioritize the following:

1.  **Larger Corpus:** The analysis must be replicated on a large, diverse corpus of political texts to confirm the stability of the observed correlations and archetypes.
2.  **Richer Metadata:** Corpora must be annotated with metadata such as speaker ideology, political party, rhetorical context (e.g., campaign rally, legislative debate), and pre-defined style (e.g., populist, technocratic). This would enable robust validation of the framework's classifications.
3.  **Temporal Analysis:** A longitudinal study tracking speakers over time could reveal how their civic character evolves in response to political events or changes in their career.
4.  **Cross-Cultural Analysis:** Applying the CAF to political discourse from other democratic systems could test the universality of its ethical dimensions.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though limited in scope, demonstrates that the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 is a powerful tool for dissecting the moral and ethical dimensions of political discourse. The study successfully used the framework to quantify the civic character of eight speakers, revealing a clear spectrum from highly virtuous to highly vice-driven rhetoric.

The analysis provided strong preliminary evidence for the framework's internal validity, showing that its theoretically opposed dimensions are empirically opposed in practice. It identified coherent clusters of virtues and vices that constitute distinct rhetorical meta-strategies, and it produced clear speaker archetypes that align with established concepts of institutional and populist rhetoric. The derived metrics, particularly the Civic Character Index and the Tension Indices, proved to be highly insightful. While these results must be considered provisional pending larger-scale validation, they represent a significant step toward a more rigorous, data-driven, and ethically-grounded understanding of civic communication.
