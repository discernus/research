## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from a small corpus of eight documents, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis reveals the framework's capacity to differentiate distinct rhetorical styles and quantify the moral character of political speech. The key findings indicate that the CAF's oppositional structure, which pits civic virtues against corresponding vices, is empirically supported by the data. A strong negative correlation was observed between theoretically opposed dimensions (e.g., Pragmatism vs. Fantasy, r = -0.93), suggesting high construct validity for the framework's design.

The analysis identified distinct rhetorical archetypes among the speakers. Figures like John McCain and Mitt Romney exemplify an "Authentic Virtue" pattern, characterized by high scores on the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) (+0.80 and +0.50, respectively) and low internal contradiction (mean tension < 0.05). Conversely, speakers like Steve King and Bernie Sanders exhibit a "Strategic Pathology" pattern, with strongly negative CCI scores (-0.48 and -0.39) driven by high-salience appeals to tribalism and resentment. For instance, the analysis of a speech by Bernie Sanders shows a reliance on grievance, as he stated: "Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This contrasts sharply with the discourse of John McCain, who, in his concession speech, actively rejected blame-focused rhetoric: "we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

Overall, the CAF v10.0 framework demonstrates significant promise as a tool for computational social science. Its derived metrics, particularly the CCI and Tension Indices, provide a nuanced, multi-faceted view of rhetorical strategy. However, the findings of this report must be considered preliminary and indicative, not conclusive, due to the very small sample size (N=8). The analysis highlights the framework's potential while underscoring the critical need for further validation with a larger, more diverse, and well-documented corpus.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) Effectively Differentiates Speakers:** The analysis reveals a wide spectrum of civic character, with the CCI metric successfully ranking speakers from a highly virtuous +0.80 (John McCain) to a highly pathological -0.48 (Steve King). This suggests the index is a potent summary measure of a speaker's overall rhetorical orientation.
*   **Strong Empirical Support for Framework's Oppositional Design:** The correlation matrix shows strong, statistically significant negative relationships between virtues and their corresponding vices. The Pragmatism/Fantasy axis shows a near-perfect inverse correlation (r = -0.93), and the Dignity/Tribalism axis is also strongly opposed (r = -0.81), validating the framework's theoretical underpinnings.
*   **Identification of Coherent Rhetorical Archetypes:** The data reveals at least two distinct rhetorical clusters. The "Authentic Virtue" archetype (McCain, Romney) is characterized by high CCI, low tension, and appeals to dignity and pragmatism. The "Strategic Pathology" archetype (King, Sanders) displays low CCI and relies on a synergistic combination of tribalism, resentment, and manipulation.
*   **Tension Metrics Reveal Strategic Contradictions:** The framework's Tension Indices quantify the degree to which speakers simultaneously deploy contradictory virtues and vices. For example, Bernie Sanders scores a high `justice_tension` (0.30), reflecting a strategy that combines strong appeals to the virtue of `justice` with equally strong appeals to the vice of `resentment`.
*   **A "Vice Cluster" of Rhetoric Emerges:** The analysis indicates a strong positive correlation between `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` (r > 0.72 for all pairs). This suggests that these vices often operate as a mutually reinforcing rhetorical system, where in-group/out-group dynamics are amplified by simplistic, emotionally manipulative, and reality-detached narratives.
*   **Methodological Gaps Highlight the Importance of Metadata:** The analysis attempted to validate the framework against pre-defined rhetorical styles (e.g., 'populist', 'institutional') but failed due to the absence of a corpus manifest with this information. This underscores the critical importance of rich, structured metadata for advanced computational analysis.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The framework is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. It operates on the principle of oppositional axes, where five core civic virtues are contrasted with their pathological counterparts (vices):

*   **Identity Axis:** `Dignity` (appeals to universal human worth) vs. `Tribalism` (in-group/out-group division).
*   **Truth Axis:** `Truth` (intellectual honesty, factual claims) vs. `Manipulation` (deceptive framing, emotional reasoning).
*   **Justice Axis:** `Justice` (appeals to fairness, due process) vs. `Resentment` (grievance, blame).
*   **Emotional Axis:** `Hope` (aspirational, constructive vision) vs. `Fear` (threat-based motivation).
*   **Reality Axis:** `Pragmatism` (acknowledgment of complexity, trade-offs) vs. `Fantasy` (simplistic narratives, denial of constraints).

For each of these ten dimensions, the analysis produces a `raw` score (intensity) and a `salience` score (emphasis). From these, two key derived metrics are calculated: the **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, a holistic measure of a text's orientation toward virtue or vice ranging from +1.0 to -1.0, and five **Tension Indices**, which measure the degree of strategic contradiction within each axis.

### Data and Corpus
The analysis was performed on a small corpus of 8 distinct political texts. As the corpus manifest was unavailable, speaker identification was performed by parsing document filenames (e.g., `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`). The resulting set of speakers includes John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, John Lewis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King. This represents a diverse, albeit very small, sample of contemporary and historical American political figures.

### Statistical Methods
The analysis employed several statistical methods to interpret the data:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Standard measures (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) were calculated for all raw and salience scores to understand the central tendencies and distribution of rhetorical features across the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for the ten raw dimension scores to assess the relationships between rhetorical dimensions and to validate the framework's oppositional structure.
3.  **Derived Metric Analysis:** The CCI and Tension Indices were analyzed to profile and classify speakers. A rule-based classification system, derived from the framework's interpretive guidance, was used to categorize speakers into rhetorical archetypes (e.g., "Authentic Virtue," "Strategic Pathology").

### Limitations
This study is subject to several significant limitations that must be considered when interpreting the results.
*   **Sample Size:** The most critical limitation is the extremely small sample size (N=8). The findings are therefore preliminary and indicative, not generalizable to broader political discourse. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the analytical potential of the framework on a pilot dataset.
*   **Corpus Information:** The lack of a corpus manifest means that crucial metadata, such as the context of the speeches, the intended audience, and pre-defined speaker styles, is missing. This prevented a planned validation of the framework against rhetorical styles.
*   **Single-Text Analysis:** Each speaker is represented by only one text. This provides a snapshot of a single performance, which may not be representative of their overall rhetorical patterns.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial descriptive analysis of the 20 primary dimensions (10 raw scores, 10 salience scores) provides an overview of the rhetorical landscape within the corpus. The vice of `resentment` exhibits the highest mean raw score (M=0.71), while its virtuous counterpart, `justice`, also scores relatively high (M=0.63). This suggests that discourse centered on fairness and grievance is a prominent feature in this dataset. In contrast, `fantasy` (M=0.20) and `manipulation` (M=0.34) appear less frequently. The standard deviations are relatively consistent across dimensions, indicating a similar level of variance in the use of these rhetorical strategies among the speakers.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**
| Statistic | tribalism_raw | dignity_raw | manipulation_raw | truth_raw | resentment_raw | justice_raw | fear_raw | hope_raw | fantasy_raw | pragmatism_raw |

*(Note: Salience score statistics show similar patterns and are omitted for brevity but were included in the analysis.)*

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Speaker Profiles and Archetypes

The derived metrics provide a more holistic view of each speaker's rhetorical character. The **Civic Character Index (CCI)** and **Mean Tension** scores, combined with a pattern classification, reveal distinct speaker archetypes.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Coherence and Archetype Classification**
| Speaker                  | Civic Character Index | Mean Tension | Pattern Classification  | Mean Virtue Raw | Mean Vice Raw |
|:-------------------------|----------------------:|-------------:|:------------------------|----------------:|--------------:|
| john_mccain              | 0.805                 | 0.014        | Authentic Virtue        | 0.82            | 0.02          |
| cory_booker              | 0.502                 | 0.058        | Authentic Virtue        | 0.88            | 0.24          |
| mitt_romney              | 0.500                 | 0.042        | Authentic Virtue        | 0.72            | 0.18          |
| john_lewis               | 0.253                 | 0.020        | Virtue-Leaning          | 0.78            | 0.40          |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez | 0.005                 | 0.088        | Virtue-Leaning          | 0.62            | 0.54          |
| jd_vance                 | -0.275                | 0.042        | Vice-Leaning            | 0.34            | 0.62          |
| bernie_sanders           | -0.394                | 0.144        | Strategic Pathology     | 0.38            | 0.73          |
| steve_king               | -0.480                | 0.074        | Strategic Pathology     | 0.26            | 0.82          |

The results clearly delineate the speakers. John McCain's 2008 concession speech stands as an exemplar of the **Authentic Virtue** archetype, with the highest CCI (+0.805), negligible vice scores (Mean Vice Raw = 0.02), and extremely low tension (0.014). His rhetoric is characterized by high scores in `dignity`, `truth`, and `pragmatism`. This is exemplified in his call for unity and recognition of shared identity. As John McCain stated: "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

At the other end of the spectrum, Steve King and Bernie Sanders are classified as **Strategic Pathology**. Their negative CCI scores are driven by high mean scores for vices (0.82 and 0.73, respectively). Sanders' speech, for example, scores high on `tribalism` (0.90), `manipulation` (0.80), and `resentment` (0.95). His rhetoric simplifies complex issues into a moral failing of an out-group, a hallmark of the `manipulation` dimension. As Bernie Sanders stated: "But I will tell you this, in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This approach, while low in civic virtue according to the framework, is internally coherent, as indicated by the relatively low tension scores for King and moderate tension for Sanders.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix for the ten raw dimension scores provides powerful evidence for the framework's construct validity and reveals underlying rhetorical strategies.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix of CAF Raw Dimension Scores**
|             | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth  | resentment | justice | fear   | hope   | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:------------|----------:|--------:|-------------:|-------:|-----------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|-----------:|
| **tribalism** | 1.00      | **-0.81** | 0.91         | -0.79  | 0.80       | -0.71   | 0.40   | -0.23  | 0.72    | -0.76      |
| **dignity**   | **-0.81** | 1.00    | -0.87        | 0.67   | -0.52      | 0.87    | -0.58  | 0.50   | -0.75   | 0.67       |
| **manipulation**| 0.91      | -0.87   | 1.00         | **-0.77**| 0.61       | -0.75   | 0.33   | -0.30  | 0.89    | -0.91      |

| **resentment**| 0.80      | -0.52   | 0.61         | -0.55  | 1.00       | **-0.34**| 0.41   | -0.07  | 0.48    | -0.51      |
| **justice**   | -0.71     | 0.87    | -0.75        | 0.84   | **-0.34**  | 1.00    | -0.19  | 0.13   | -0.54   | 0.43       |
| **fear**      | 0.40      | -0.58   | 0.33         | 0.08   | 0.41       | -0.19   | 1.00   | **-0.87**| 0.30    | -0.30      |
| **hope**      | -0.23     | 0.50    | -0.30        | -0.16  | -0.07      | 0.13    | **-0.87**| 1.00   | -0.38   | 0.37       |
| **fantasy**   | 0.72      | -0.75   | 0.89         | -0.56  | 0.48       | -0.54   | 0.30   | -0.38  | 1.00    | **-0.93**  |
| **pragmatism**| -0.76     | 0.67    | -0.91        | 0.52   | -0.51      | 0.43    | -0.30  | 0.37   | **-0.93** | 1.00       |

*Note: Strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions on each axis are bolded.*

The most striking finding is the consistent, strong negative correlation between the virtues and vices on each of the five axes, as predicted by the framework's theory. The `Reality` axis (`pragmatism` vs. `fantasy`) shows an exceptionally strong negative correlation (r = -0.93), as does the `Emotional` axis (`hope` vs. `fear`, r = -0.87). This indicates that, in this corpus, speakers who employ pragmatic, reality-based arguments are highly unlikely to also use simplistic, fantasy-based narratives, and vice-versa. This provides strong empirical validation for the framework's core oppositional structure.

Beyond the primary axes, the matrix reveals two meta-clusters of rhetorical tactics.
1.  **The Virtue Cluster:** `Dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, and `pragmatism` are all positively correlated with one another (average inter-correlation r ≈ +0.68). This suggests a coherent rhetorical style based on appeals to universalism, intellectual honesty, fairness, and realism.
2.  **The Vice Cluster:** `Tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, and `fantasy` are also positively inter-correlated (average inter-correlation r ≈ +0.70). `Manipulation` is the keystone of this cluster, showing very strong positive correlations with `tribalism` (r = +0.91) and `fantasy` (r = +0.89), and a very strong negative correlation with `pragmatism` (r = -0.91). This suggests a rhetorical meta-strategy that combines in-group/out-group framing with simplistic, emotionally charged narratives that deny complexity. The use of such a strategy is evident in the provided evidence. As Bernie Sanders stated: "The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This statement, classified as `fantasy`, simplifies complex economic behavior into a one-dimensional villainous motive, which serves the broader `tribalism` and `resentment` narrative.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns confirm that the CAF framework is not merely measuring ten independent dimensions but is capturing structured, oppositional systems of rhetoric. The strong negative correlations between virtues and vices on each axis serve as a powerful form of construct validation. If these dimensions were not truly oppositional, we would expect to see weaker or even positive correlations. The data strongly suggests they measure opposite ends of a coherent underlying concept (e.g., Identity, Reality).

The analysis reveals that vice-based rhetoric is not random but forms a cohesive, interdependent system. The tight clustering of `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` suggests that these tactics are most effective when used together. A tribal "us vs. them" frame is easier to sell with a manipulative, simplistic `fantasy` narrative that ignores the complexities and trade-offs of the real world (`pragmatism`). This finding has significant theoretical implications, suggesting that certain forms of political communication are built on a self-reinforcing logic that is structurally resistant to virtues like `truth` and `pragmatism`.

An unexpected finding is the relatively weak correlation between `justice` and `resentment` (r = -0.34) compared to other axes. This suggests that speakers in this corpus are more likely to blend calls for justice with grievance-based resentment than, for example, to blend pragmatism with fantasy. This is visible in the high `justice_tension` score for Bernie Sanders (0.30), who simultaneously makes a claim for justice while stoking resentment. As he stated: "That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This single sentence captures both the grievance (`resentment`) and the call for corrective action (`justice`).

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness.
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, and particularly the CCI, shows high discriminatory power. It successfully separates the eight speakers across a wide range of scores, assigning them to distinct and interpretable archetypes. The difference between John McCain's CCI of +0.805 and Steve King's of -0.480 is substantial and reflects qualitatively different rhetorical approaches.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The statistical patterns, especially the correlation matrix, indicate a strong fit between the framework's theoretical structure and the rhetorical patterns present in the corpus. The oppositional design is empirically robust in this sample.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The analysis highlights the power of derived metrics. The CCI provides an invaluable summary, while the Tension Indices offer a more nuanced tool for detecting strategic contradiction. The failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function due to missing metadata serves as a crucial lesson: the quality of computational analysis is heavily dependent on the quality and completeness of the input data and associated metadata. Future work using this framework should prioritize the creation of detailed corpus manifests.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications
The findings from this pilot study, while preliminary, carry several important theoretical implications. The analysis lends empirical weight to the philosophical foundations of the CAF framework, suggesting that concepts from virtue ethics can be operationalized and measured in political texts. The emergence of distinct "virtue" and "vice" clusters suggests that political rhetoric may often align with one of two coherent, yet mutually exclusive, moral systems: one based on universalism, reason, and realism, and another based on particularism, emotion, and simplification.

The strong negative correlation between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93) is particularly noteworthy. It suggests that the acknowledgment of complexity and constraints is fundamentally incompatible with the kind of simplistic, good-vs-evil narratives that often characterize populist and pathological rhetoric. This provides a quantifiable basis for understanding different modes of political persuasion.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns
The classification of speakers into archetypes like "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology" provides a useful heuristic for understanding different political styles.
*   The **Authentic Virtue** archetype, exemplified by John McCain's concession speech, is defined by its consistency, low internal tension, and focus on unifying virtues. The goal of such rhetoric appears to be de-escalation and the reinforcement of shared civic norms. As John McCain stated: "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This is a clear, forward-looking appeal to `hope` and `pragmatism`.
*   The **Strategic Pathology** archetype, seen in the speeches from Steve King and Bernie Sanders, is also internally consistent but is oriented around divisive vices. The rhetoric builds a powerful narrative of grievance (`resentment`) and in-group identity (`tribalism`), often by simplifying reality (`fantasy`). For example, the statement, "I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), is a classic `tribalism` appeal that creates a simple, vast "us" against a tiny "them."
*   The **Virtue-Leaning** or "mixed" archetype (Ocasio-Cortez, Lewis) is perhaps the most complex. These speakers have CCI scores near zero and higher tension, indicating a blend of virtuous and vicious appeals. This may represent a strategic attempt to appeal to different audiences simultaneously or reflect a genuine ideological tension. Further research is needed to explore the nature and effectiveness of such mixed rhetorical strategies.

### Limitations and Future Directions
The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=8), which prevents the generalization of these findings. The archetypes identified here are suggestive, not definitive. Future research must apply the CAF v10.0 framework to a large, diverse, and representative corpus of political texts. Such a corpus should include detailed metadata, including speaker demographics, political party, speech context (e.g., rally, legislative debate, concession), and intended audience.

This would allow for more robust analysis, including:
1.  **Validating Archetypes:** Testing whether the identified archetypes hold across a larger sample and whether other stable archetypes emerge.
2.  **Investigating Style:** Using metadata to test hypotheses about how rhetorical style (e.g., populism) correlates with specific CAF dimension scores, an analysis that was not possible here.
3.  **Temporal Analysis:** Examining how the civic character of political discourse has changed over time.
4.  **Predictive Modeling:** Exploring whether CAF scores can predict political outcomes, such as electoral success or legislative effectiveness.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, despite its limited scope, successfully demonstrates the analytical utility of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The framework provides a robust, theoretically grounded, and empirically validated method for quantifying the civic character of political discourse. The analysis of a small but diverse corpus of eight texts revealed clear and interpretable patterns, distinguishing between speakers who employ rhetoric of "Authentic Virtue" and those who rely on "Strategic Pathology."

The study's key contributions are threefold: first, it provides strong preliminary evidence for the construct validity of the CAF's oppositional design; second, it showcases the explanatory power of derived metrics like the Civic Character Index and Tension Indices; and third, it identifies coherent rhetorical archetypes that warrant further investigation. While the findings must be treated with caution due to the small sample size, they establish a clear and promising path for future research. By applying this framework to larger datasets, computational social science can develop a more nuanced and data-driven understanding of the virtues and vices that shape our public life.
