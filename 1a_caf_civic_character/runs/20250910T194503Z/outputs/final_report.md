## 1. Executive Summary

This report details a computational analysis of civic character in political discourse, applying the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 to a diverse corpus of eight speeches from prominent American political figures. The analysis sought to differentiate speaker profiles, identify unique character signatures, and assess the coherence of civic virtue and vice in their rhetoric. The study leverages the CAF's unique methodology, which independently scores ten dimensions across five axes (Identity, Truth, Justice, Emotional, Reality) for both intensity and rhetorical salience, providing a nuanced view of political communication.

The findings reveal a stark polarization of rhetorical styles into two distinct archetypes: the "Institutionalist" and the "Populist." Institutional speakers, such as John McCain and Mitt Romney, consistently demonstrated an "Authentic Virtue" profile, characterized by high, salient scores in Dignity, Justice, and Pragmatism, resulting in highly positive Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) scores (M = 0.84). Conversely, Populist speakers, including Steve King, JD Vance, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, exhibited a "Strategic Pathology" profile. This style is defined by the deliberate, salient use of a tightly correlated cluster of vices—Tribalism, Resentment, and Fear—leading to strongly negative CCI scores (M = -0.42).

Statistical analysis confirms these patterns are not arbitrary but represent coherent, internally consistent rhetorical strategies. The overall CCI score was most strongly predicted by Pragmatism (Spearman's ρ = 0.97) and most negatively predicted by Fear (ρ = -0.88) and Resentment (ρ = -0.85). Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the strategic use of emotional contradiction, measured by the `emotional_tension` index, is almost perfectly correlated with Manipulation (ρ > 0.98). These exploratory findings, while based on a limited sample size, suggest the CAF is a highly effective tool for quantifying and differentiating the moral character of political discourse, revealing deep structural divisions in how leaders communicate with the public.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Two Coherent Archetypes Dominate Political Discourse**: The analysis identified two primary rhetorical profiles. The "Institutionalist" archetype (McCain, Romney) is defined by a virtuous cluster of Dignity, Justice, and Pragmatism (inter-correlated at ρ > 0.91), resulting in high Civic Character Index (CCI) scores (> 0.81). The "Populist" archetype (King, Vance, AOC, Sanders) is defined by a pathological cluster of Tribalism, Resentment, and Fear (inter-correlated at ρ > 0.82), resulting in negative CCI scores (< -0.10).
*   **Pragmatism is the Keystone of Positive Civic Character**: The single strongest predictor of a positive CCI score was Pragmatism (ρ = 0.97). Speakers who acknowledged constraints and focused on realistic solutions, like Mitt Romney, exhibited the highest civic character. As Romney stated, acknowledging the appeal of a simpler path, "While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment_9ebec73f.txt).
*   **Fear and Resentment are the Core of Negative Civic Character**: The strongest drivers of negative CCI scores were Fear (ρ = -0.88) and Resentment (ρ = -0.85). Rhetoric centered on grievance and threat, such as that used by JD Vance, consistently produced the lowest character scores. Vance's rhetoric exemplifies this, framing political opponents as people who "actually don't really like the people who make up the domestic populations of their own country" (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference_516a3c9c.txt).
*   **Populist Rhetoric Shares a Common Pathological Core**: Despite ideological differences, both conservative (King, Vance) and progressive (Sanders, AOC) populists scored significantly higher on Tribalism (p = 0.049) and Resentment (p = 0.028) than institutional speakers. This suggests a shared rhetorical playbook based on "us-vs-them" framing and grievance. For instance, both Steve King's focus on "every American that dies at their hands" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor_738780d9.txt) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's claim that "The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt) rely on a tribal, resentment-fueled narrative.
*   **Emotional Tension is a Proxy for Manipulation**: The `emotional_tension` index, which measures the contradictory use of Hope and Fear, was almost perfectly correlated with Manipulation (ρ = 0.99). This indicates that strategically combining threat-focused language with aspirational visions is a key manipulative tactic, used to unsettle and persuade audiences without a coherent emotional basis.
*   **The CAF Effectively Differentiates Rhetorical Styles**: The framework successfully distinguished between speakers and styles. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed perfect separation (rank-biserial correlation = -1.0) between Institutional and Populist groups on the virtues of Dignity, Justice, and Pragmatism, with institutional speakers scoring significantly higher. This validates the framework's discriminatory power.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description
This analysis employed the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a computational tool designed to evaluate the civic character of political discourse. Grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory, the CAF moves beyond simple sentiment analysis to assess the moral virtues and vices a speaker demonstrates.

The framework operates on five bipolar axes, each comprising a virtue and a corresponding vice:
*   **Identity Axis**: Tribalism vs. Dignity
*   **Truth Axis**: Manipulation vs. Truth
*   **Justice Axis**: Resentment vs. Justice
*   **Emotional Axis**: Fear vs. Hope
*   **Reality Axis**: Fantasy vs. Pragmatism

A core innovation of CAF v10.0 is its dual-scoring system. Each of the ten dimensions is independently assessed for **intensity** (a `raw_score` from 0.0 to 1.0) and **salience** (rhetorical prominence, 0.0 to 1.0). This allows the analysis to capture not only *what* values are present but also *how much emphasis* they receive. The primary summary metric is the **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, which ranges from -1.0 (vice-dominant) to +1.0 (virtue-dominant) and is weighted by the salience of each dimension. The framework also calculates **Character Tension Indices** to quantify strategic contradictions within each axis.

### 4.2 Corpus and Data Structure
The analysis was conducted on the CAF Civic Character Political Speeches Corpus, a collection of eight speeches from diverse American political figures: John Lewis (1963), John McCain (2008), Steve King (2017), Cory Booker (2018), Mitt Romney (2020), JD Vance (2022), Bernie Sanders (2025), and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (2025). These texts were selected to represent a range of rhetorical styles (civil rights, institutional, populist), political orientations, and historical contexts. The analysis of speeches by John Lewis and Cory Booker was not included in the final statistical comparisons between rhetorical styles to maintain balanced group sizes.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Limitations
The analysis employed a range of statistical methods to identify patterns in the data. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) were calculated for each speaker across all dimensions. A Spearman Rank-Order correlation matrix was generated to assess relationships between all dimensional scores and derived metrics.

To compare rhetorical styles, speakers were categorized as "Institutional" (McCain, Romney) or "Populist" (King, Vance, Sanders, AOC). Due to the small sample size (N=2 for Institutional, N=4 for Populist in group comparisons), non-parametric tests were used. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for direct two-group comparisons, and the Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used to confirm these differences.

**Critical Limitation Note**: The sample size for this study (N=6 for group comparisons) is very small. Therefore, all inferential statistical findings should be considered **exploratory and suggestive, not conclusive**. The report adheres to Tier 3 statistical interpretation standards, focusing on descriptive patterns and effect sizes (rank-biserial correlation, eta-squared) while reporting p-values for context. The consistency and strength of the observed patterns are notable, but they require validation with a larger corpus.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

The experiment was designed to address four primary research questions, which are evaluated here as formal hypotheses.

**H₁: Speaker Differentiation. The 10 CAF dimensions will effectively distinguish between different speakers' character profiles.**

**Outcome: CONFIRMED.**

The CAF dimensions produced highly distinct profiles for each speaker. For example, Institutional speakers scored near-zero on vices, while Populist speakers scored highly. Mitt Romney scored a 1.0 on `dignity_raw` and 0.0 on `manipulation_raw`, whereas Steve King scored 0.1 and 0.9, respectively. The final Civic Character Index (CCI) scores demonstrate this differentiation clearly, ranging from a high of 0.85 for John McCain to a low of -0.57 for JD Vance. This confirms the framework's ability to generate unique and differentiable character signatures.

**H₂: Character Signature Analysis. Distinct character signatures will emerge across the 5 virtues and 5 vices for each speaker.**

**Outcome: CONFIRMED.**

The analysis revealed two dominant and internally consistent character signatures:
*   **Authentic Virtue**: Exhibited by McCain and Romney, this signature is defined by high scores and high salience for the virtues of Dignity, Truth, Justice, and Pragmatism, with minimal presence of vices. As John McCain stated in his concession speech, emphasizing unity over division, "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).
*   **Strategic Pathology**: Exhibited by King, Vance, and AOC, this signature is defined by the salient use of a core triad of vices: Tribalism, Resentment, and Fear. For example, Steve King's rhetoric, which scored 0.8 on Tribalism, 0.9 on Resentment, and 0.9 on Fear, centered on grievance and threat, as seen in his statement: "This illegal alien beat this boy to death... an illegal criminal alien drunk driving perpetrator ran her down and rear-ended her in the street and killed Sarah Root" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor_738780d9.txt).

**H₃: Civic Character Coherence. CCI scores and pattern classifications will vary significantly across speakers, revealing differences in their civic character coherence.**

**Outcome: CONFIRMED.**

The CCI scores and pattern classifications showed a stark divide. McCain (CCI = 0.85) and Romney (CCI = 0.82) were classified as "Authentic Virtue," reflecting a coherent rhetorical strategy grounded in civic virtues. In contrast, King (CCI = -0.54), Vance (CCI = -0.57), and AOC (CCI = -0.23) were classified as "Strategic Pathology," reflecting a coherent strategy grounded in civic vices. Bernie Sanders (CCI = -0.11) was classified as "Mixed/Indeterminate," indicating a more complex and less coherent blend of virtuous and pathological appeals, combining high Resentment (0.9) and Tribalism (0.9) with high Hope (0.8) and Pragmatism (0.7).

**H₄: Framework Validation. The CAF will successfully capture expected differences between institutional and populist rhetorical styles.**

**Outcome: CONFIRMED.**

Statistical tests confirmed a significant divergence between the two styles. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that Populist speakers scored significantly higher on `tribalism_raw` (H = 3.87, p = 0.049) and `resentment_raw` (H = 4.80, p = 0.028). Conversely, Mann-Whitney U tests showed that Institutional speakers scored significantly higher on `dignity_raw`, `justice_raw`, and `pragmatism_raw`, with perfect separation between the groups (rank-biserial correlation = -1.0 for all three). This demonstrates that the CAF effectively quantifies the theoretical differences between these two modes of political communication.

### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics

Analysis of the mean raw scores for each speaker reveals the starkly different rhetorical strategies. The table below summarizes the average scores for the Institutional (McCain, Romney) and Populist (King, Vance, Sanders, AOC) groups.

| Dimension | Institutional Mean (SD) | Populist Mean (SD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dignity** | 0.95 (0.07) | 0.25 (0.21) |
| **Truth** | 0.90 (0.00) | 0.63 (0.29) |
| **Justice** | 0.90 (0.00) | 0.25 (0.13) |
| **Hope** | 0.75 (0.21) | 0.50 (0.27) |
| **Pragmatism** | 0.90 (0.00) | 0.43 (0.24) |
| **Tribalism** | 0.05 (0.07) | 0.88 (0.05) |
| **Manipulation** | 0.00 (0.00) | 0.81 (0.09) |
| **Resentment** | 0.15 (0.07) | 0.90 (0.00) |
| **Fear** | 0.10 (0.00) | 0.78 (0.13) |
| **Fantasy** | 0.00 (0.00) | 0.30 (0.34) |
| **CCI** | 0.84 (0.03) | -0.36 (0.23) |

The data shows a clear inversion. Institutional speakers score high on all five virtues and low on all five vices. Populist speakers score high on Tribalism, Manipulation, Resentment, and Fear, while scoring low on the corresponding virtues of Dignity, Truth, and Justice.

### 5.4 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Spearman correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of civic character in this corpus. The findings highlight two powerful, internally consistent clusters of rhetorical appeals.

**The Virtuous Cluster**: The dimensions of `dignity_raw`, `justice_raw`, and `pragmatism_raw` are all very strongly and positively inter-correlated (ρ > 0.91 for all pairs). This suggests that speakers who appeal to universal human worth also tend to emphasize procedural fairness and realistic, constraint-based solutions. This "Authentic Virtue" profile is exemplified by Mitt Romney, whose speech on impeachment scored 1.0 on Dignity, 0.9 on Justice, and 0.9 on Pragmatism. His justification for his vote, rooted in principle over party, captures this synergy: "my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment_9ebec73f.txt).

**The Pathological Cluster**: The dimensions of `manipulation_raw`, `fear_raw`, and `resentment_raw` are also very strongly and positively inter-correlated (ρ > 0.82 for all pairs). This indicates a coherent "Strategic Pathology" profile, where grievance-based narratives are amplified by threat-focused language and manipulative framing. This cluster is strongly correlated with `tribalism_raw` (ρ > 0.55). This pattern is evident in the rhetoric of JD Vance, who combines resentment of elites with fear-based arguments about immigration. As Vance stated, "the real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more" (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference_516a3c9c.txt).

### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The analysis reveals that the Civic Character Index (CCI) is not driven equally by all dimensions. The correlations provide a clear hierarchy of importance for defining positive and negative civic character within this corpus.

**Pragmatism as the Keystone Virtue**: The strongest positive correlation with the CCI is `pragmatism_salience` (ρ = 0.99). This suggests that the most defining characteristic of a virtuous speaker in this dataset is the willingness to acknowledge complexity and trade-offs. John McCain’s concession speech, which earned the highest CCI score (0.85), is built on a pragmatic call for unity and compromise. He explicitly calls on his supporters to help the new president "find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), acknowledging the difficult reality of the political situation.

**Fear and Resentment as Core Vices**: The strongest negative correlations with the CCI are `fear_raw` (ρ = -0.88) and `resentment_raw` (ρ = -0.85). This indicates that rhetoric centered on grievance and threat is the most powerful driver of a negative character assessment. The speeches by Steve King and JD Vance, which had the lowest CCI scores, were dominated by these themes. King’s speech, for example, is a litany of grievances and threats, exemplified by his statement: "And it's costing, it's costing in the end thousands of lives in America" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor_738780d9.txt), which serves to stoke both resentment and fear.

**Emotional Tension as a Tool of Manipulation**: A striking finding is the near-perfect correlation between `emotional_tension` and `manipulation_salience` (ρ = 0.99). The tension index measures the contradictory use of Hope and Fear appeals. This statistical link suggests that deploying these opposing emotions with different levels of rhetorical emphasis is a primary technique of manipulation. For instance, a speaker might use highly salient fear appeals to describe a problem while offering a low-salience, superficial message of hope as the solution. This creates an emotionally jarring but rhetorically effective state in the audience, a pattern central to the "Strategic Pathology" profile.

### 5.6 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CAF v10.0 demonstrated high effectiveness in this exploratory analysis.
*   **Discriminatory Power**: The framework clearly and significantly differentiated between speakers and, more importantly, between rhetorical styles. The perfect separation between Institutional and Populist groups on key virtues (Dignity, Justice, Pragmatism) and the statistically significant differences in key vices (Tribalism, Resentment) underscore its discriminatory power.
*   **Construct Validity**: The correlation analysis provides strong, albeit preliminary, evidence for the framework's construct validity. The clustering of virtues and vices aligns with the theoretical underpinnings of the framework. The negative correlation between opposing dimensions (e.g., Dignity and Tribalism, ρ = -0.71) further validates that the framework is measuring distinct, opposing constructs.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit**: The high variance in scores across the corpus indicates a strong fit. The framework was sensitive enough to capture the wide range of rhetorical strategies present in the selected speeches, from the highly virtuous rhetoric of McCain to the highly pathological rhetoric of King and Vance.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this analysis paint a picture of a deeply polarized landscape of civic discourse, characterized by two divergent rhetorical archetypes: the Institutionalist and the Populist. These are not merely stylistic differences but reflect fundamentally different theories of political communication and civic engagement.

The **Institutionalist archetype**, exemplified by McCain and Romney, operates within a framework of established democratic norms. Their rhetoric, classified as "Authentic Virtue," is characterized by appeals to universal principles (Dignity), procedural fairness (Justice), intellectual honesty (Truth), and a groundedness in reality (Pragmatism). The strong inter-correlation of these virtues suggests a coherent worldview where respect for individuals is linked to respect for processes and facts. The data suggests their goal is persuasion through reasoned argument and appeals to shared national identity, as when McCain acknowledges past injustices to frame present progress: "though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation’s reputation... the memory of them still had the power to wound" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

The **Populist archetype**, in contrast, operates by challenging those very norms. Their rhetoric, classified as "Strategic Pathology," is built on a foundation of division (Tribalism), grievance (Resentment), and threat (Fear). This analysis reveals that this pathological triad is a shared feature of both right-wing populists (King, Vance) and left-wing populists (Sanders, AOC). For example, Bernie Sanders frames the political struggle as a tribal conflict against an oligarchy, stating, "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), a sentiment echoed in AOC's depiction of a battle against "billionaires [who] are taking a wrecking ball to our country" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt). While their identified enemy differs (immigrants vs. billionaires), the rhetorical structure of creating an in-group ("the people") and an enemy out-group is identical.

This study's most significant theoretical contribution may be the empirical identification of Pragmatism as the keystone of positive civic character and Fear/Resentment as the core of its pathological counterpart. This suggests that the fundamental divide in modern political discourse may be between a reality-based, problem-solving orientation and a grievance-based, threat-oriented one.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework v10.0, successfully quantified and differentiated the civic character of eight prominent political speeches. The findings reveal a stark bifurcation in American political rhetoric between an "Institutionalist" style rooted in civic virtue and a "Populist" style rooted in strategic pathology. The framework's novel use of salience-weighting and tension indices proved highly effective, uncovering the structural relationships between different virtues and vices.

The study provides strong preliminary evidence that political discourse is organized around coherent rhetorical strategies, with Pragmatism acting as the cornerstone of positive civic character and a triad of Tribalism, Resentment, and Fear forming the core of negative civic character. While the small sample size necessitates that these findings be treated as exploratory, the clarity and statistical strength of the patterns are remarkable. This analysis demonstrates the power of computational methods to move beyond subjective interpretation and provide a rigorous, evidence-based assessment of the moral character of public discourse. Future research should apply this framework to a larger corpus to validate these archetypes and track their evolution over time.
