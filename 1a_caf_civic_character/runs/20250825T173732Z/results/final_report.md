## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from a corpus of eight documents, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis reveals a significant polarization in rhetorical styles, with speakers clustering into distinct archetypes of either high civic virtue or high civic vice. The primary derived metric, the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI), effectively quantifies this divide, with scores ranging from a high of +0.80 (John McCain) to a low of -0.48 (Steve King), indicating the framework's strong discriminatory power.

The internal structure of the CAF framework demonstrates notable empirical support in this preliminary study. Strong, statistically significant negative correlations were found between the framework's opposing virtue and vice dimensions—most notably between Pragmatism and Fantasy (r = -0.93) and Dignity and Tribalism (r = -0.81). This suggests that the framework is measuring coherent and theoretically grounded oppositional constructs. Furthermore, the analysis identifies clear rhetorical meta-strategies: an "Authentic Virtue" pattern characterized by high scores in dignity, truth, and pragmatism, and a "Strategic Pathology" pattern characterized by high scores in tribalism, resentment, and manipulation.

While these findings are compelling, they must be considered preliminary due to the study's significant limitations, including a small sample size (N=8) and the absence of a corpus manifest, which precluded validation against pre-defined rhetorical styles. The results, however, provide a strong proof-of-concept for the CAF's utility in systematically evaluating political discourse and generate specific, testable hypotheses for future, larger-scale research.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of civic character in political discourse yielded several key insights, supported by the statistical data:

*   **Rhetorical Polarization is Quantifiable:** The discourse within this corpus is highly polarized. Speakers do not occupy a middle ground but tend towards either a strongly virtuous or a strongly vice-driven rhetorical style. This is evidenced by the bimodal distribution of the Civic Character Index (CCI), with three speakers scoring above +0.50 and three scoring below -0.27.
*   **Framework's Oppositional Structure is Empirically Supported:** The CAF's theoretical design, which pairs virtues against opposing vices, is strongly validated by the data. Key virtue-vice pairs exhibit large negative correlations, indicating they measure genuinely opposing concepts. For example, Dignity and Tribalism are strongly negatively correlated (r = -0.81), as are Pragmatism and Fantasy (r = -0.93).
*   **Distinct Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge:** The analysis identifies coherent speaker profiles that can be classified into archetypes. The "Authentic Virtue" archetype (e.g., John McCain, CCI = +0.80) is characterized by high virtue scores and very low tension. In contrast, the "Strategic Pathology" archetype (e.g., Steve King, CCI = -0.48; Bernie Sanders, CCI = -0.39) is defined by high vice scores and relatively low internal contradiction.
*   **Vices and Virtues Cluster into Meta-Strategies:** The correlation matrix reveals two distinct clusters of rhetorical tactics. Vices such as `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` are strongly inter-correlated, suggesting they form a cohesive pathological strategy. Conversely, virtues like `dignity`, `truth`, and `justice` cluster together, forming a virtuous communicative strategy.
*   **The Justice/Resentment Axis is Uniquely Complex:** Unlike other virtue-vice pairs, `justice` and `resentment` show only a weak negative correlation (r = -0.34). This suggests that speakers can and do blend appeals to justice with grievance-based resentment, a complex strategy observed in speakers across the political spectrum in this corpus. This is exemplified by one speaker's statement, which was coded for both dimensions: As Bernie Sanders stated, `"That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change"` (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).
*   **The Civic Character Index is a Potent Summary Metric:** The CCI effectively distills the complex, 20-dimensional data into a single, interpretable score that aligns with qualitative assessments of speaker style. It successfully differentiates speakers and serves as a powerful tool for ranking and comparison.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description
This analysis employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The framework is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. It assesses rhetoric across five fundamental, oppositional axes, each comprising a virtue and its corresponding vice:

*   **Identity Axis:** `dignity` (appeals to universal human worth) vs. `tribalism` (in-group/out-group division).
*   **Truth Axis:** `truth` (intellectual honesty, factual claims) vs. `manipulation` (emotional framing, deception).
*   **Justice Axis:** `justice` (appeals to fairness, systemic solutions) vs. `resentment` (blame, grievance).
*   **Emotional Axis:** `hope` (optimistic, forward-looking vision) vs. `fear` (threat-based motivation).
*   **Reality Axis:** `pragmatism` (acknowledgment of constraints, trade-offs) vs. `fantasy` (simplistic, unconstrained narratives).

For each of these 10 dimensions, the analysis generates a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1).

### 4.2 Data Structure and Corpus
The dataset for this study comprises the complete analytical output for a corpus of eight political speeches. Each speech was treated as a single document, and each was delivered by a different public figure. The automated analysis extracted speaker names from filenames (e.g., 'john_mccain', 'bernie_sanders').

A significant limitation of this study is the absence of a corpus manifest (`corpus.md not found`). This prevented the analysis from accessing pre-defined metadata, such as the rhetorical 'style' of each speaker (e.g., 'populist', 'institutional'). Consequently, the planned validation of the framework against such styles could not be performed.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints
The analysis proceeded through several stages, using the functions generated for this experiment:

1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Standard measures (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) were calculated for all 20 raw and salience scores to provide a baseline understanding of the data distribution.
2.  **Derived Metrics Calculation:** Two key sets of metrics were computed as specified by the CAF.
    *   **Character Tension Indices:** Calculated for each of the five axes to measure the degree of strategic contradiction within a speech (e.g., simultaneously using high levels of both `hope` and `fear`).
    *   **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI):** A composite score summarizing the overall civic character, calculated as the difference between weighted virtue scores and weighted vice scores, normalized by total salience. This index ranges from -1.0 (maximally vice-dominant) to +1.0 (maximally virtue-dominant).
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for the 10 raw dimension scores to examine the relationships between rhetorical tactics and to assess the framework's construct validity.
4.  **Archetypal Analysis:** A rule-based classification system, derived from the CAF's interpretive guidance, was applied to speaker profiles to categorize them into rhetorical archetypes (e.g., "Authentic Virtue," "Strategic Pathology").

The primary analytical constraint is the small sample size (N=8). This pilot-scale analysis means that while patterns can be identified, they are not generalizable. All findings should be interpreted as preliminary and suggestive, intended to generate hypotheses for larger-scale studies.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the 20 core dimensions across all eight documents reveals a discourse landscape marked by contention and high emotional stakes. The dimensions with the highest average raw scores are `resentment` (M=0.71), `truth` (M=0.66), and `justice` (M=0.63). This suggests that the analyzed speeches are frequently centered on grievances, factual claims, and calls for fairness. Conversely, dimensions like `fantasy` (M=0.20) and `manipulation` (M=0.34) are less prevalent on average, though their standard deviations indicate significant variance between speakers.

The standard deviations are particularly informative. Dimensions such as `tribalism` (SD=0.42), `dignity` (SD=0.36), and `pragmatism` (SD=0.37) show high variability, confirming that speakers adopt vastly different strategies regarding identity, community, and realism. This high variance is a prerequisite for the framework's ability to discriminate between different rhetorical styles.

*(Note: Salience score statistics show similar patterns and are omitted for brevity.)*

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Character, Coherence, and Tension

The derived metrics provide a more holistic view of each speaker's rhetorical character. The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) reveals a stark divide among the speakers. As shown in Table 2, three speakers (John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney) exhibit a strongly positive CCI, indicating their rhetoric is dominated by civic virtues. Conversely, three speakers (JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, Steve King) have strongly negative scores, indicating a dominance of civic vices. This polarization suggests that the speakers in this corpus adopt coherent, but diametrically opposed, civic postures.

The `mean_tension` score, which measures rhetorical contradiction, is relatively low for most speakers. This indicates that their messaging, whether virtuous or vice-driven, is internally consistent. For example, John McCain's profile of high virtue and low vice results in a very low tension score (0.01), aligning with the "Authentic Virtue" classification. His rhetoric consistently avoids vice, as seen in his assumption of responsibility: As John McCain stated, `"we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours"` (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), a statement that actively works against the vice of `resentment`.

Bernie Sanders presents the most complex case with the highest mean tension (0.14). His profile, classified as "Strategic Pathology," combines very high scores on vices like `resentment` and `tribalism` with moderate appeals to virtues like `justice` and `hope`. This blending of seemingly contradictory appeals is a sophisticated rhetorical strategy. For instance, his statement, `"I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%"` (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), is a clear example of high-salience `tribalism` that underpins his vice-leaning CCI score.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix of the 10 raw CAF dimensions (Table 3) provides strong evidence for the framework's construct validity. The data reveals a clear and consistent pattern where virtues are negatively correlated with their corresponding vices, confirming the oppositional nature of the framework's axes.

The most powerful relationship observed is between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93), a very large effect. This indicates that rhetoric grounded in real-world constraints is almost mutually exclusive with rhetoric that relies on simplistic, idealized narratives. Similarly strong negative correlations exist between `dignity` and `tribalism` (r = -0.81) and `truth` and `manipulation` (r = -0.77). These findings suggest that the CAF axes capture fundamental, dichotomous choices in rhetorical strategy.

Furthermore, the matrix reveals two "meta-strategy" clusters.
1.  **Pathological Cluster:** `Tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` are all strongly and positively correlated with one another. For example, `manipulation` and `fantasy` have a correlation of r = +0.89. This suggests a unified rhetorical approach based on division, emotional framing, and oversimplification. The rhetoric of a speaker like Bernie Sanders illustrates this, where he uses manipulative framing—`"the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs"` (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt)—in service of a larger tribal narrative.
2.  **Virtuous Cluster:** `Dignity`, `truth`, and `justice` are also positively inter-correlated. The link between `dignity` and `justice` is particularly strong (r = +0.87). This indicates a coherent virtuous strategy based on appeals to universal worth, fairness, and honesty. This is exemplified in John McCain's concession speech, which combines `dignity` for his opponent with `hope` for the future: `"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"` (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

| **resentment**| 0.80      | -0.52   | 0.61         | -0.55  | 1.00       | -0.34   | 0.41   | -0.07  | 0.48    | -0.51      |

| **fantasy**   | 0.72      | -0.75   | 0.89         | -0.56  | 0.48       | -0.54   | 0.30   | -0.38  | 1.00    | -0.93      |
| **pragmatism**| -0.76     | 0.67    | -0.91        | 0.52   | -0.51      | 0.43    | -0.30  | 0.37   | -0.93   | 1.00       |

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed in this small corpus offer preliminary insights into the structure of civic rhetoric. The most striking finding is the empirical validation of the CAF's oppositional axes. The strength of the negative correlation between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93) suggests that the Reality Axis represents a fundamental and clarifying choice for a speaker: one either engages with complexity and constraints or retreats into simplistic, unworkable narratives. It is difficult to do both.

An unexpected and theoretically rich finding is the weak negative relationship between `justice` and `resentment` (r = -0.34). While the framework posits them as an oppositional pair, the data suggests a more nuanced dynamic. Speakers can evidently make strong calls for `justice` while simultaneously leveraging high levels of `resentment`. This may indicate that some rhetorical styles, particularly populist ones, frame the redress of grievances (`resentment`) as the primary pathway to `justice`. The provided textual evidence for Bernie Sanders, where the same sentence serves as an example for both dimensions, supports this interpretation directly. This finding suggests that the Justice Axis may be less a simple dichotomy and more a complex continuum where the *nature* of the appeal to justice (e.g., restorative vs. retributive) is key.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 demonstrates considerable effectiveness.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully differentiates between speakers, assigning them to distinct and interpretable archetypes. The wide range of the CCI scores and the high standard deviation on key dimensions like `tribalism` and `dignity` show that the framework is sensitive to meaningful variations in rhetorical style.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CAF's dimensions appear well-suited to analyzing the provided corpus of political speeches. The concepts measured by the framework were consistently present in the documents, allowing for robust scoring and comparison.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The derived metrics, particularly the CCI and the Tension Indices, are valuable innovations. The CCI provides a powerful summary statistic, while the Tension Indices offer a way to identify more complex, contradictory rhetorical strategies. The failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function highlights a critical dependency: for certain types of validation, the framework requires a well-documented corpus with rich metadata.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Theoretical Implications
The findings from this pilot study, while preliminary, have several theoretical implications. The strong empirical support for the oppositional structure of the CAF's axes lends quantitative weight to the classical understanding of virtues and vices as coherent, opposing behavioral patterns. The analysis moves beyond simple topic modeling or sentiment analysis to map the underlying moral character of discourse. The identification of "virtuous" and "pathological" rhetorical clusters suggests that speakers' choices across different dimensions are not random but are part of larger, integrated meta-strategies.

The complexity of the Justice/Resentment axis warrants further theoretical exploration. It suggests that in contemporary political discourse, the line between a forward-looking call for justice and a backward-looking politics of grievance can be blurred. This may reflect a broader shift in how political claims are legitimized, where mobilizing resentment is seen as a necessary precondition for achieving justice.

### 6.2 Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns
The analysis reveals at least three distinct rhetorical archetypes within this small sample:

1.  **The Institutionalist (Authentic Virtue):** Represented by John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney. This archetype is characterized by a high CCI (> +0.50), low tension, and a focus on the virtues of `dignity`, `truth`, and `pragmatism`. Their rhetoric emphasizes unity, acknowledges complexity, and adheres to traditional norms of civic discourse. As John McCain stated, acknowledging historical progress while recognizing remaining challenges: `"though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation... the memory of them still had the power to wound"` (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).
2.  **The Populist Agitator (Strategic Pathology):** Represented by Steve King and Bernie Sanders. This archetype has a strongly negative CCI (< -0.35) and is defined by high scores in `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `manipulation` or `fantasy`. Their rhetoric simplifies complex issues into a struggle between a virtuous in-group and a corrupt out-group. Their messaging is internally coherent (low tension), indicating a focused and strategic deployment of vice-based appeals.
3.  **The Ideological Pugilist (Ambivalent/Leaning):** Represented by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and, to a lesser extent, John Lewis. This archetype has a CCI near zero and higher tension scores. They blend strong appeals to virtues like `justice` and `dignity` with equally strong appeals to vices like `resentment` and `tribalism`. Their rhetoric is a battleground of competing values, reflecting a more confrontational and less institutionally-bound style.

### 6.3 Broader Significance and Limitations
If these findings were confirmed in a larger study, they would have significant implications for understanding the health of democratic discourse. The ability to track the prevalence of these archetypes over time could serve as a barometer for political polarization and the erosion of civic norms.

However, the limitations of this study cannot be overstated. The sample size of eight speakers is too small to draw any generalizable conclusions about political discourse as a whole. The speakers are not a representative sample of any political body or ideology. The absence of a corpus manifest and the sparse textual evidence for most speakers mean that many interpretations are based on statistical patterns alone. Therefore, this report should be seen as a methodological proof-of-concept and a source of hypotheses, not a definitive statement on the state of civic rhetoric.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, despite its limitations, successfully demonstrates the potential of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 to bring systematic, quantitative rigor to the study of political character. The framework proved effective at differentiating speaker styles, identifying coherent rhetorical archetypes, and providing preliminary empirical validation for its own theoretical structure. The analysis revealed a polarized rhetorical landscape, with speakers adopting consistent strategies rooted in either civic virtue or civic vice.

The study's key contributions are both methodological and substantive. Methodologically, it showcases the utility of derived metrics like the Civic Character Index and Tension Indices in capturing holistic rhetorical patterns. Substantively, it provides preliminary evidence for the clustering of virtues and vices into distinct meta-strategies and highlights the unique complexity of the Justice/Resentment axis in contemporary discourse.

Future research is essential to build upon these indicative findings. Applying the CAF to a large, diachronic, and representative corpus of political texts would allow for the confirmation of these archetypes, the tracking of rhetorical trends over time, and a more robust investigation into the complex dynamics of civic communication. This pilot study serves as a promising first step in that direction.
