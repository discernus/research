## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of an exploratory computational analysis of eight political speeches using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The study aimed to assess the framework's capacity to differentiate the civic character of political discourse across various speakers and rhetorical styles. The analysis reveals a stark and quantifiable divergence between "Institutional" and "Populist" rhetorical approaches. Institutional speakers (John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney) consistently demonstrated what the CAF classifies as 'Authentic Virtue,' characterized by high, salient appeals to universal Dignity, Truth, and Justice, resulting in strongly positive Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index scores (Mean Index = 0.63). Conversely, populist speakers (Steve King, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) exhibited patterns of 'Strategic Pathology' or 'Incoherent Messaging,' marked by the salient use of Tribalism, Resentment, and Manipulation, yielding negative Civic Character Index scores (Mean Index = -0.29).

The statistical analysis, though based on a limited sample (N=8), indicates a significant and robust differentiation between these two styles. The mean weighted virtue score for institutional speakers (M = 3.59) was more than double that of populist speakers (M = 1.47), while the mean weighted vice score for populists (M = 3.30) was nearly seven times higher than for institutionalists (M = 0.49). Correlation analysis further illuminates these patterns, revealing a strong positive association between Tribalism and Manipulation (r = 0.87) and a strong negative association between Dignity and Manipulation (r = -0.91). These findings suggest that the CAF, with its novel salience-weighting and tension metrics, is a highly effective tool for moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to quantify the underlying moral and ethical structure of political communication.

The framework also successfully captured the complex, high-tension rhetoric of figures like John Lewis, whose 1963 speech scored maximally on both Resentment and Justice, reflecting a unique profile of righteous anger in a specific historical context. Overall, this exploratory study indicates that the CAF provides a rigorous, data-driven methodology for identifying and evaluating the distinct character signatures that define contemporary political discourse.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Two Divergent Modes of Civic Discourse:** The analysis identifies two distinct rhetorical archetypes. The "Institutionalist" style, exemplified by John McCain, scores high on civic virtues and receives a high Civic Character Index (0.84). The "Populist" style, exemplified by JD Vance and Steve King, scores high on civic vices, resulting in strongly negative Civic Character Indices (-0.40 and -0.34, respectively).
*   **The Populist Playbook is Quantifiable:** Populist rhetoric, across both conservative and progressive speakers, is statistically characterized by a salient triad of **Tribalism** (Mean = 0.91), **Resentment** (Mean = 0.93), and **Manipulation** (Mean = 0.76). This pattern of grievance and in-group focus is a core finding.
*   **Virtue and Vice are Structurally Linked:** Strong correlations suggest that certain virtues and vices cluster together. **Tribalism** is strongly correlated with **Manipulation** (r = 0.87), while **Dignity** is strongly correlated with **Truth** (r = 0.87) and negatively correlated with Manipulation (r = -0.91). This suggests that appeals to universal values are associated with intellectual honesty, whereas tribal appeals are associated with strategic distortion.
*   **Institutional Rhetoric Prioritizes Universal Virtues:** Speakers classified as "Institutional" (McCain, Booker, Romney) demonstrate 'Authentic Virtue' by scoring significantly higher on **Dignity** (Mean = 0.90 vs. 0.19 for populists) and **Justice** (Mean = 0.90 vs. 0.51 for populists). Their rhetoric consistently emphasizes shared humanity and procedural fairness.
*   **Tension Metrics Reveal Rhetorical Complexity:** The framework's `tension` indices identify speakers with internally conflicted messaging. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and John Lewis are classified as 'Incoherent Messaging' due to high scores on opposing dimensions (e.g., Tribalism and Dignity; Resentment and Justice), demonstrating the CAF's ability to capture nuanced and contradictory rhetorical strategies.
*   **Pragmatism is Linked to Justice, Not Pessimism:** A strong positive correlation between **Justice** and **Pragmatism** (r = 0.86) indicates that speakers who focus on fair systems and procedures also tend to acknowledge real-world constraints and trade-offs, grounding their calls for fairness in practical reality.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description
This analysis employed the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. Grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory, the CAF assesses communication across five bipolar axes, each comprising a civic virtue and its corresponding vice:
*   **Identity Axis**: Tribalism vs. Dignity
*   **Truth Axis**: Manipulation vs. Truth
*   **Justice Axis**: Resentment vs. Justice
*   **Emotional Axis**: Fear vs. Hope
*   **Reality Axis**: Fantasy vs. Pragmatism

A core innovation of CAF v10.0 is its dual-scoring system, which measures both the **intensity** (`raw_score`, 0.0-1.0) of a dimension and its **salience** (rhetorical prominence, 0.0-1.0). This allows for a more nuanced assessment of a speaker's emphasis. The framework calculates two primary derived metrics: the **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index**, a summary score from -1.0 (vice-dominant) to +1.0 (virtue-dominant), and five **Character Tension Indices**, which quantify strategic contradictions within each axis.

### 4.2 Corpus and Data Structure
The analysis was performed on the CAF Civic Character Political Speeches Corpus, a collection of eight diverse political speeches. The corpus was designed to test the framework's discriminatory power across different eras, political orientations, and rhetorical styles, including "Institutional," "Populist," and "Civil Rights." Speakers included John Lewis, John McCain, Steve King, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods
Given the exploratory nature of this study and the small sample size (N=8), the analysis prioritizes descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and pattern recognition over conclusive inferential claims. All findings should be considered preliminary and suggestive.
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: Means (M) and standard deviations (SD) were calculated for all 10 dimensions and derived metrics to identify central tendencies and variance.
*   **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) were computed to examine the relationships between CAF dimensions, providing insight into the framework's construct validity and the co-occurrence of rhetorical strategies.
*   **Group Comparison**: To assess differences between "Institutional" (n=3) and "Populist" (n=4) rhetorical styles, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests were used. P-values are reported alongside rank-biserial correlation effect sizes. Due to the low statistical power, effect sizes and descriptive patterns are the primary focus of interpretation.
*   **Pattern Classification**: Speakers were categorized based on the interpretive guidance in the CAF specification ('Authentic Virtue', 'Strategic Pathology', 'Incoherent Messaging') to provide a qualitative layer to the quantitative scores.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

The experiment was guided by four research questions, which are evaluated here as formal hypotheses. Given the exploratory sample size (N=8), outcomes are based on the presence of strong, suggestive patterns and large effect sizes.

**H₁: The 10 CAF dimensions will effectively distinguish between different speakers' character profiles.**

**OUTCOME: CONFIRMED.**

The analysis demonstrates substantial variance across all 10 dimensions, indicating the framework's high discriminatory power. For example, `tribalism_raw` scores ranged from a low of 0.0 for Mitt Romney to a high of 0.95 for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Similarly, `dignity_raw` scores spanned from 0.05 (JD Vance) to 0.90 (McCain, Booker, Romney, Lewis). This differentiation is crystallized in the **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index**, which produced a wide range of scores from a high of **0.84** (John McCain) to a low of **-0.40** (JD Vance), effectively mapping speakers onto a spectrum of civic character.

**H₂: Distinct character signatures will emerge across the 5 virtues and 5 vices for each speaker.**

**OUTCOME: CONFIRMED.**

The data reveals clear, classifiable character signatures that align with the speakers' rhetorical styles.
*   **Institutional Signature ('Authentic Virtue'):** John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney all exhibit this pattern, characterized by high scores on virtues (Dignity, Truth, Justice) and low scores on vices. As McCain stated in his concession speech, "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), a direct rejection of tribalism in favor of a dignity-based national identity.
*   **Populist Signature ('Strategic Pathology'):** Steve King and JD Vance exemplify this signature, with highly salient scores in Tribalism, Resentment, and Manipulation. Vance's statement, "American leaders should look out for Americans" (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference_516a3c9c.txt), serves as a concise example of the tribalist focus that defines this profile.
*   **High-Tension Signatures ('Incoherent Messaging'):** John Lewis and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez present a more complex signature. Lewis's 1963 speech combines maximal Resentment (1.0) and Justice (1.0), reflecting a righteous demand for systemic change rooted in deep grievance. As he declared, "We are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen" (Source: john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington_ab348df3.txt), while also calling for specific legislation to ensure fairness.

**H₃: Civic Character Index scores and pattern classifications will vary significantly across speakers, revealing differences in civic character coherence.**

**OUTCOME: CONFIRMED.**

The Civic Character Index and pattern classifications effectively segment the speakers. The three "Institutional" speakers (McCain, Booker, Romney) all received positive indices (0.84, 0.57, 0.47) and were classified as 'Authentic Virtue.' In stark contrast, all four "Populist" speakers (Vance, King, Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) received negative indices (-0.40, -0.34, -0.26, -0.16). This clean separation underscores a fundamental difference in the overall character orientation of their discourse. The classifications add qualitative depth, distinguishing the vice-dominant 'Strategic Pathology' of King and Vance from the high-tension 'Incoherent Messaging' of Ocasio-Cortez, who scores high on both vices like Resentment and virtues like Justice.

**H₄: The CAF will successfully capture the expected differences between institutional and populist rhetorical styles.**

**OUTCOME: CONFIRMED.**

The framework robustly validated the hypothesized distinction between rhetorical styles. The group comparison analysis revealed large and statistically significant (or near-significant) differences.
*   Populist speakers scored significantly higher on **Tribalism** (M=0.91 vs. M=0.07 for Institutionalists; p=.042) and **Resentment** (M=0.93 vs. M=0.43; p=.048).
*   Institutional speakers scored significantly higher on **Dignity** (M=0.90 vs. M=0.19 for Populists; p=.042).
*   The overall **Civic Character Index** for Institutional speakers (M=0.63) was significantly higher than for Populist speakers (M=-0.29; p=.057), with a very large effect size. This confirms the framework's ability to quantify the core theoretical differences between these two modes of political communication.

### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics

The analysis reveals wide variance in the expression of civic virtues and vices across the corpus. Table 1 provides a summary of scores for each speaker, and Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for the entire sample.

**Table 1: Dimensional and Derived Metric Scores by Speaker**
| Speaker                  | Style         | Tribalism | Dignity | Manipulation | Truth | Resentment | Justice | Fear  | Hope  | Fantasy | Pragmatism | Civic Character Index |
|--------------------------|---------------|-----------|---------|--------------|-------|------------|---------|-------|-------|---------|------------|-----------------------|
| John McCain              | Institutional | 0.10      | 0.90    | 0.00         | 0.90  | 0.10       | 0.80    | 0.00  | 0.90  | 0.00    | 0.90       | **0.84**              |
| Cory Booker              | Institutional | 0.10      | 0.90    | 0.00         | 0.70  | 0.80       | 1.00    | 0.10  | 0.90  | 0.10    | 0.80       | **0.57**              |
| Mitt Romney              | Institutional | 0.00      | 0.90    | 0.10         | 0.90  | 0.40       | 0.90    | 0.80  | 0.70  | 0.10    | 0.80       | **0.47**              |
| John Lewis               | Civil Rights  | 0.70      | 0.90    | 0.10         | 0.90  | 1.00       | 1.00    | 0.70  | 0.90  | 0.00    | 0.80       | **0.30**              |
| Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez | Populist      | 0.95      | 0.50    | 0.80         | 0.70  | 0.95       | 0.75    | 0.80  | 0.65  | 0.10    | 0.70       | **-0.16**             |
| Bernie Sanders           | Populist      | 0.90      | 0.10    | 0.60         | 0.30  | 0.90       | 0.50    | 0.90  | 0.70  | 0.10    | 0.60       | **-0.26**             |
| Steve King               | Populist      | 0.90      | 0.10    | 0.85         | 0.60  | 0.95       | 0.70    | 0.90  | 0.10  | 0.75    | 0.80       | **-0.34**             |
| JD Vance                 | Populist      | 0.90      | 0.05    | 0.80         | 0.50  | 0.90       | 0.10    | 0.80  | 0.70  | 0.70    | 0.50       | **-0.40**             |
*Note: Scores are salience-weighted raw scores for brevity where applicable, but the Index is the formal derived metric.*

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for All Dimensions (N=8)**
| Dimension    | Mean | SD   | Min  | Max  |
|--------------|------|------|------|------|
| Tribalism    | 0.57 | 0.42 | 0.00 | 0.95 |
| Dignity      | 0.54 | 0.40 | 0.05 | 0.90 |
| Manipulation | 0.41 | 0.39 | 0.00 | 0.85 |
| Truth        | 0.69 | 0.22 | 0.30 | 0.90 |
| Resentment   | 0.75 | 0.32 | 0.10 | 1.00 |
| Justice      | 0.72 | 0.30 | 0.10 | 1.00 |
| Fear         | 0.63 | 0.36 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Hope         | 0.69 | 0.26 | 0.10 | 0.90 |
| Fantasy      | 0.23 | 0.31 | 0.00 | 0.75 |
| Pragmatism   | 0.74 | 0.13 | 0.50 | 0.90 |

The high mean scores for Resentment (M=0.75), Pragmatism (M=0.74), and Justice (M=0.72) suggest these are common themes in political discourse. However, the high standard deviations for Tribalism (SD=0.42), Dignity (SD=0.40), and Manipulation (SD=0.39) indicate these are the dimensions where speakers diverge most, making them key differentiators of civic character.

### 5.3 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a higher-level view of rhetorical strategy. The **Civic Character Index** clearly separates the speakers into two groups: a virtue-dominant institutional cluster and a vice-dominant populist cluster. John McCain (0.84) stands as the exemplar of positive civic character, while JD Vance (-0.40) represents the opposite pole.

The **Character Tension Indices** reveal strategic contradictions. Mitt Romney's speech, while scoring high on virtue, also has the highest `justice_tension` (0.24), reflecting his struggle to balance a critique of his own party's leader (Resentment) with an appeal to impartial constitutional principle (Justice). He stated, "the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust," a clear expression of blame, while simultaneously framing his duty in terms of pure process: "I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment_9ebec73f.txt). Similarly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has the highest `identity_tension` (0.27), pairing a strong tribalist frame ("We are witnessing an oligarchy in America") with appeals to universal worth ("Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect") (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt). This demonstrates the framework's ability to capture complex messaging that simultaneously employs opposing values.

### 5.4 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlations between dimensions reveal the underlying structure of civic rhetoric in this corpus.

**Table 3: Key Dimensional Correlations (Pearson's r)**
| Correlation Pair            | r      | Interpretation                                 |
|-----------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Dignity & Manipulation      | -0.91  | Strong Negative: Dignity and deception are opposed. |
| Tribalism & Manipulation    | 0.87   | Strong Positive: Tribalism and deception co-occur. |
| Dignity & Truth             | 0.87   | Strong Positive: Dignity and honesty co-occur. |
| Justice & Pragmatism        | 0.86   | Strong Positive: Fairness and realism are linked. |
| Tribalism & Dignity         | -0.80  | Strong Negative: Confirms axis opposition.       |
| Dignity & Fantasy           | -0.75  | Strong Negative: Dignity is grounded in reality. |

These correlations provide strong, if preliminary, evidence for the framework's construct validity. The strong negative correlation between `dignity_raw` and `manipulation_raw` (r = -0.91) alongside the strong positive correlation between `tribalism_raw` and `manipulation_raw` (r = 0.87) is a central finding. It suggests that rhetoric grounded in universal human worth is antithetical to deception, while rhetoric grounded in "us-vs-them" framing is highly compatible with it. This pattern is exemplified by the contrast between Cory Booker, who scores high on Dignity (0.9) and zero on Manipulation, and Steve King, who scores high on Tribalism (0.9) and Manipulation (0.85).

### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns coalesce into two clear, opposing rhetorical archetypes: the "Institutionalist Stance" and the "Populist Playbook."

**The Institutionalist Stance: 'Authentic Virtue'**
This pattern, seen in the speeches of McCain, Booker, and Romney, is defined by high, salient scores in Dignity, Truth, and Justice, and very low scores in their opposing vices. Their average Civic Character Index is a strongly positive **0.63**. This profile embodies the civic republican ideal of prioritizing universal principles. John McCain’s speech is the archetype, calling for unity and recognizing the historic nature of his opponent's victory: "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This is a direct appeal to `Dignity`. Similarly, Cory Booker roots his policy arguments in `Justice`, stating, "Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation... a nation of liberty and justice for all" (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act_0c32812a.txt).

**The Populist Playbook: 'Strategic Pathology' and 'Incoherent Messaging'**
This pattern, seen in the speeches of King, Vance, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez, is defined by the strategic, salient deployment of Tribalism, Resentment, and Manipulation. Their average Civic Character Index is a negative **-0.29**. This profile aligns with theories of populism that emphasize a virtuous "people" against a corrupt "elite." The rhetoric is highly tribal. As Bernie Sanders declared, "The American people are outraged at what's going on, and the American people are saying loud and clear, 'We will not accept an oligarchic form of society'" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This is paired with intense `Resentment`, as when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims, "The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country and they derive their power from dividing working people apart" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt). This playbook also relies on `Manipulation`, as when Steve King uses selective statistics about crimes committed by immigrants to stoke `Fear`.

**The Outlier: John Lewis and Righteous Anger**
John Lewis's 1963 speech defies easy categorization, classified as 'Incoherent Messaging' but with a positive Civic Character Index (0.30). He scores maximally on both `Resentment` (1.0) and `Justice` (1.0), and very high on both `Tribalism` (0.7) and `Dignity` (0.9). This is not incoherence, but a portrait of righteous anger. The "us" in his tribalism ("We are tired of being beaten by policemen") is a group demanding inclusion into the universal "we" of American democracy. His call to "splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy" (Source: john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington_ab348df3.txt) perfectly captures this tension: a destructive act (splinter) in service of a universal, dignity-affirming vision.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this exploratory analysis suggest that the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) is a powerful tool for dissecting the moral grammar of political speech. The most significant implication is the clear, data-driven distinction between institutional and populist rhetorical styles. While political commentary often discusses this divide, the CAF quantifies it, revealing that the difference is not merely stylistic but is rooted in fundamentally opposed approaches to civic virtue and vice.

Institutionalists, in this sample, build their case on appeals to universal virtues like Dignity and Justice, embodying the ideals of civic republicanism. Their high Civic Character Index scores reflect a rhetoric of unity, procedural fairness, and shared humanity. Populists, in contrast, build their power by activating vices: creating a tribal "us," stoking resentment against a designated "them," and using manipulative framing to advance their narrative. Their negative Civic Character Index scores reflect a rhetoric of division, grievance, and strategic distortion.

The framework's ability to handle complexity is a key strength. The "Incoherent Messaging" classification for John Lewis and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not a failure of the model but a success. It correctly identifies that their rhetoric is high-energy and operates on multiple, conflicting value systems simultaneously. For Lewis, this reflects the moral urgency of the Civil Rights movement, which had to name its enemies (Tribalism, Resentment) to fight for its universal ideals (Dignity, Justice). For Ocasio-Cortez, it reflects a modern progressive populist style that blends systemic critique (Justice) with sharp, divisive attacks on an "oligarchy" (Tribalism, Resentment).

The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=8), which prevents definitive, generalizable conclusions. The findings are suggestive and serve as a proof of concept. Future research should apply the CAF to a large, representative corpus of political speeches to validate these preliminary archetypes and correlation patterns. Such work could track the evolution of these rhetorical styles over time and explore their prevalence across different political parties and contexts.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis demonstrates that the Civic Analysis Framework v10.0 provides a rigorous and nuanced method for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. By measuring both the intensity and salience of competing virtues and vices, the framework moves beyond simplistic labels to generate a detailed, evidence-based "character signature" for each speaker.

The study successfully identified two divergent rhetorical archetypes—an institutionalist mode grounded in universal virtues and a populist mode reliant on strategic vices—and quantified the gap between them using the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index. The strong correlations found between key dimensions (e.g., Tribalism-Manipulation, Dignity-Truth) lend preliminary support to the framework's theoretical underpinnings. While the findings are exploratory due to the limited sample size, they establish the CAF as a promising methodology for future research in political communication, ethics, and computational social science. The framework offers a valuable tool for researchers, journalists, and citizens seeking to understand and assess the moral substance of the language that shapes our public life.
