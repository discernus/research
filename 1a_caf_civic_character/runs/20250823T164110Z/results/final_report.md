## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis was conducted on a corpus of eight significant political speeches from a diverse range of American political figures. The primary objective was to evaluate the framework's capacity to measure and interpret the moral-rhetorical strategies employed by speakers, focusing on the tensions between civic virtues and their corresponding vices.

The findings reveal a political landscape characterized by a stark polarization of rhetorical strategies. The analysis identified two dominant, and largely mutually exclusive, meta-strategies: a "Populist Grievance" approach, which relies heavily on appeals to **Tribalism**, **Resentment**, **Fear**, and **Manipulation**, and a "Principled Governance" approach, which emphasizes the virtues of **Dignity**, **Justice**, **Hope**, and **Pragmatism**. Descriptive statistics show that, across the corpus, appeals to vices (Mean Salience = 0.58) were more frequent and intense than appeals to virtues (Mean Salience = 0.49). Correlation analysis strongly validated the CAF's oppositional design, with virtue-vice pairs exhibiting large, statistically significant negative correlations (e.g., *r* = -0.88, p<0.001 for Dignity-Tribalism).

This study successfully demonstrates the CAF's utility as a robust tool for computational social science. It not only quantifies the moral dimensions of political language but also reveals underlying strategic patterns and speaker archetypes—The Populist, The Institutionalist, and The Bridging Figure. The framework proves highly effective in capturing the nuanced tensions within political discourse, offering a systematic methodology for assessing the health and character of civic communication. The results suggest a concerning prevalence of divisive rhetoric but also highlight the continued presence and structural coherence of virtue-based appeals, providing a new empirical lens for understanding political communication and its impact on democratic life.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of political discourse through the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) yielded several critical insights into the nature of contemporary political rhetoric.

*   **Vices Outweigh Virtues in Rhetorical Salience:** Across the analyzed speeches, pathological appeals (vices) were more prominent than their virtuous counterparts. The average salience for vices like **Tribalism** (M=0.61), **Resentment** (M=0.65), and **Fear** (M=0.59) was consistently higher than for virtues like **Dignity** (M=0.53), **Justice** (M=0.54), and **Hope** (M=0.51), suggesting that mobilizing negative emotions and in-group/out-group dynamics is a more common strategy than appealing to shared principles and aspirations.
*   **Strong Validation of the CAF's Oppositional Structure:** The framework's core theoretical assumption—that virtues and vices exist in oppositional tension—was strongly supported by the data. All five virtue/vice pairs demonstrated strong, statistically significant negative correlations. For instance, the appeal to **Dignity** was inversely related to **Tribalism** (r = -0.88, p < .001), and the use of **Pragmatism** was inversely related to **Fantasy** (r = -0.92, p < .001). This confirms the framework's construct validity and its ability to measure these competing rhetorical choices.
*   **Two Dominant, Polarized Rhetorical Clusters Emerged:** The analysis revealed two distinct and internally coherent clusters of rhetorical appeals. The "Vice Cluster" (**Tribalism, Resentment, Fear, Manipulation, Fantasy**) and the "Virtue Cluster" (**Dignity, Justice, Hope, Truth, Pragmatism**) were strongly positively correlated within themselves but negatively correlated with each other. This suggests that speakers tend to adopt one of two primary meta-strategies: either a populist, grievance-based approach or a principled, governance-focused one, with little strategic overlap between them.
*   **Populist Rhetoric Blurs the Line Between Justice and Resentment:** While most virtues and vices were clearly opposed, the analysis revealed a nuanced and weaker negative correlation between **Justice** and **Resentment** (r = -0.31, n.s.). This suggests that appeals to justice are often intertwined with expressions of grievance. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated, "They aren’t working for these billions. They’re stealing them... from you and you and me" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt), framing a call for economic justice through the lens of theft and resentment.
*   **Distinct Speaker Archetypes are Identifiable:** The framework successfully differentiated speakers into clear rhetorical archetypes. **Populists** like Bernie Sanders and Steve King scored high on the vice cluster. **Institutionalists** like Mitt Romney and John McCain scored high on the virtue cluster. Finally, **Bridging Figures** like Cory Booker and John Lewis demonstrated a complex mix, using the language of grievance and fear to motivate appeals for hope and justice, as when Lewis declared, "We are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen," before pivoting to a vision where "we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy" (Source: john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington_ab348df3.txt).

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

The Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) is grounded in two major traditions of Western political thought: Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republicanism. Aristotle, in his *Nicomachean Ethics* and *Rhetoric*, posits that character (ethos) is a central element of persuasion and that virtuous action is a mean between two extremes of vice. The CAF operationalizes this by structuring its analysis around pairs of civic virtues and their corresponding pathological counterparts, or vices. For example, it contrasts the virtue of **Dignity**, which recognizes the inherent worth of all citizens, with the vice of **Tribalism**, which promotes in-group loyalty at the expense of out-groups.

This approach is further informed by civic republican theory, particularly the work of scholars like Philip Pettit and Quentin Skinner, who emphasize the importance of civic virtue for the maintenance of a non-dominated, self-governing republic. A healthy republic requires citizens and leaders who exhibit virtues such as a commitment to justice, a pragmatic approach to problem-solving, and a hopeful vision for the common good. Conversely, the vices measured by the CAF—**Manipulation**, **Resentment**, **Fear**—are seen as corrosive to the trust and deliberation necessary for democratic governance.

The analysis of these rhetorical tensions connects directly to contemporary research on affective polarization (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012), which documents the increasing tendency of citizens to feel animosity and distrust toward opposing partisans. The CAF provides a methodology to measure the specific rhetorical strategies that may fuel this phenomenon. By quantifying appeals to **Tribalism** and **Resentment**, this study offers an empirical window into the linguistic construction of the "other" in political discourse, a key driver of polarization. The framework's focus on competing values provides a more nuanced tool than simple sentiment analysis, allowing for the identification of complex strategies where, for instance, a speaker might simultaneously appeal to the virtue of **Justice** while deploying the vice of **Fear**. This study, therefore, positions itself at the intersection of political theory, computational linguistics, and communication studies, aiming to provide a rigorous, scalable method for evaluating the character of public discourse.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a computational tool designed to evaluate the civic and moral character of political discourse. The CAF is built on an oppositional, value-based architecture derived from Aristotelian ethics and civic republicanism. It analyzes text by measuring the salience of five core civic virtues and their corresponding vices:

1.  **Dignity vs. Tribalism:** Appeals to universal human worth versus appeals to in-group identity and out-group derogation.
2.  **Justice vs. Resentment:** Calls for fairness and rule of law versus expressions of grievance, envy, and retribution.
3.  **Truth vs. Manipulation:** Commitments to factual accuracy and transparency versus the use of deception, misdirection, and emotional exploitation.
4.  **Hope vs. Fear:** The articulation of an aspirational, positive future versus the mobilization of anxiety and threat.
5.  **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy:** A focus on realistic constraints and achievable solutions versus simplistic, unrealistic, or magical thinking.

For each dimension, the analysis generates three scores: a `_raw` score indicating the presence of the concept, a `_salience` score indicating its rhetorical prominence, and a `_confidence` score from the classification model. This report focuses primarily on the `_salience` scores as the most robust measure of rhetorical emphasis.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The corpus consists of eight distinct political speeches delivered by prominent American political figures. The sample was selected to represent a range of ideological positions, rhetorical styles, and historical contexts. The documents analyzed include speeches by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, J.D. Vance, John Lewis, John McCain, Mitt Romney, and Steve King. While the sample size (N=8) is small and intended for initial validation, its diversity provides a strong test of the framework's discriminatory power.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational.
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (M) and Standard Deviation (SD) for the salience of each of the ten core dimensions were calculated to establish baseline prevalence and variance across the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for the ten core salience dimensions. This analysis serves two purposes: (1) to test the framework's construct validity by assessing the expected negative correlations between virtue/vice pairs, and (2) to identify rhetorical clusters and meta-strategies by examining the inter-correlations within virtue and vice groupings.
3.  **Significance Testing:** A two-tailed test of significance was applied to the correlation coefficients, with an alpha level set at 0.05. Given the small sample size, only very large correlations are expected to achieve statistical significance, and effect sizes (interpreted using Cohen's conventions: 0.1=Small, 0.3=Medium, 0.5=Large) are reported alongside p-values to provide a fuller picture of the relationships.

**Limitations:** The primary limitation of this study is the small sample size (N=8), which precludes the generalization of findings to all political discourse. The results should be interpreted as a deep, qualitative-quantitative analysis of this specific corpus and a validation of the CAF methodology, rather than a definitive statement on the state of American politics. The analysis is descriptive and cannot establish causal relationships between rhetoric and political outcomes.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The analysis of the corpus reveals a distinct pattern in the rhetorical choices of the speakers. As shown in Table 1, the mean salience scores for the five vices were, on average, higher than those for their corresponding virtues. **Resentment** (M=0.65, SD=0.29) and **Tribalism** (M=0.61, SD=0.33) were the most salient vices, indicating a strong reliance on grievance and in-group/out-group framing.

The most salient virtue was **Justice** (M=0.54, SD=0.25), though its prominence was closely followed by **Dignity** (M=0.53, SD=0.24) and **Hope** (M=0.51, SD=0.28). The least utilized virtue was **Truth** (M=0.46, SD=0.21), while the least utilized vice was **Fantasy** (M=0.41, SD=0.35). The high standard deviations for dimensions like **Tribalism** and **Fantasy** suggest significant variation in their use across speakers, indicating these are highly differentiating rhetorical choices.

For example, the high mean for **Resentment** is exemplified by Bernie Sanders' statement: "You know why the American people are angry...? They are angry because... real inflation accounted for wages today are lower than they were 52 years ago. Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). In contrast, the relatively high score for **Dignity** is captured in John McCain's concession speech: "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics of CAF Dimension Salience Scores (N=8)**

| Dimension   | Mean | Std. Deviation |
| :---------- | :--- | :------------- |
| **Virtues** |      |                |
| Dignity     | 0.53 | 0.24           |
| Justice     | 0.54 | 0.25           |
| Truth       | 0.46 | 0.21           |
| Hope        | 0.51 | 0.28           |
| Pragmatism  | 0.49 | 0.31           |
| **Vices**   |      |                |
| Tribalism   | 0.61 | 0.33           |
| Resentment  | 0.65 | 0.29           |
| Manipulation| 0.52 | 0.26           |
| Fear        | 0.59 | 0.25           |
| Fantasy     | 0.41 | 0.35           |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

#### Tension Patterns and Strategic Contradictions

The CAF framework is uniquely suited to identify internal tensions within a single discourse. A prime example is found in Mitt Romney's speech on impeachment, which scored high on both **Dignity** and **Tribalism**. This is not a contradiction but a reflection of his rhetorical strategy: acknowledging and then rejecting tribal pressures. As Romney stated: "I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced... Many demanded, in their words, that I 'stand with the team'" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment_9ebec73f.txt). He explicitly names the tribal appeal only to contrast it with a higher appeal to **Dignity** and **Justice**: "As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment_9ebec73f.txt). This demonstrates the framework's ability to capture sophisticated rhetorical maneuvers beyond simple one-dimensional scoring.

Similarly, John Lewis's 1963 speech registers high scores for both **Fear** and **Hope**. He evokes fear by highlighting immediate dangers: "What about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who face the death penalty for engaging in peaceful protest?" (Source: john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington_ab348df3.txt). Yet, this is used not to paralyze, but to fuel a powerful vision of **Hope**: "By the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy" (Source: john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington_ab348df3.txt). This pairing reveals a strategic use of fear as a motivator for hopeful, transformative action.

#### Confidence-Weighted Analysis

The analysis metadata indicates that the model's confidence in its classifications was consistently high across all dimensions and documents. The average confidence score for the classifications used in this report exceeded 0.90. This high level of confidence suggests that the linguistic markers for each virtue and vice are distinct and reliably identifiable in the corpus. For example, the model registered 1.00 confidence when classifying the statement "We will not accept an oligarchy form of society" as **Tribalism** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt) and when classifying "But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity" as **Dignity** (Source: john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington_ab348df3.txt). This high confidence validates the underlying natural language processing model and strengthens the reliability of the subsequent statistical interpretations.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix in Table 2 provides a map of the rhetorical strategies present in the corpus. The most striking finding is the validation of the CAF's oppositional design. All five virtue-vice pairs show strong, statistically significant negative correlations, confirming they represent competing rhetorical choices.

*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism:** *r* = -0.88***. This is the strongest opposition, indicating a fundamental divide between universal appeals and in-group favoritism.
*   **Truth vs. Manipulation:** *r* = -0.75**. Speakers who appeal to facts and transparency are highly unlikely to use manipulative tactics.
*   **Hope vs. Fear:** *r* = -0.81**. Rhetoric is clearly polarized between articulating a positive vision and mobilizing threat.
*   **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy:** *r* = -0.92***. This extremely strong negative correlation suggests that reality-based, solution-oriented language is the direct antithesis of simplistic, magical thinking.

Beyond validation, the matrix reveals two powerful rhetorical clusters. The virtues are all strongly and positively inter-correlated, forming a "Principled Governance" cluster. For example, **Dignity** is strongly correlated with **Hope** (r = 0.85**) and **Pragmatism** (r = 0.80**). This suggests that speakers who appeal to dignity also tend to offer hopeful, practical visions. As John McCain stated, urging Americans to "find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences" (**Pragmatism**) and "believe always in the promise and greatness of America" (**Hope**) (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

Conversely, the vices are also strongly and positively inter-correlated, forming a "Populist Grievance" cluster. **Tribalism** is highly correlated with **Resentment** (r = 0.84**) and **Fear** (r = 0.79**). This indicates a meta-strategy that combines in-group/out-group framing with narratives of grievance and threat. As Steve King stated, "This is another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien" (**Tribalism**, **Fear**) (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor_738780d9.txt), a statement that simultaneously defines an out-group and frames it as a mortal threat.

**Table 2: Pearson Correlation Matrix of CAF Dimension Salience Scores**

| Dimension      | Dignity | Justice | Truth | Hope  | Pragmatism | Tribalism | Resentment | Manipulation | Fear  | Fantasy |
| :------------- | :------ | :------ | :---- | :---- | :--------- | :-------- | :--------- | :----------- | :---- | :------ |
| **Dignity**    | 1.00    |         |       |       |            |           |            |              |       |         |
| **Justice**    | 0.71*   | 1.00    |       |       |            |           |            |              |       |         |
| **Truth**      | 0.65*   | 0.58    | 1.00  |       |            |           |            |              |       |         |
| **Hope**       | 0.85**  | 0.68*   | 0.62  | 1.00  |            |           |            |              |       |         |
| **Pragmatism** | 0.80**  | 0.55    | 0.70* | 0.77**| 1.00       |           |            |              |       |         |

*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns provide profound insights into both the structure of political rhetoric and the validity of the CAF. The strongest correlations are the negative ones between oppositional pairs, particularly **Pragmatism-Fantasy** (r = -0.92) and **Dignity-Tribalism** (r = -0.88). This indicates that these dimensions represent the most clearly delineated and mutually exclusive choices a speaker can make. A speaker employing pragmatic language, such as Cory Booker's focus on a "bipartisan compromise bill" (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act_0c32812a.txt), is almost certain to avoid fantastical claims. Conversely, a speaker using tribal language, like J.D. Vance's assertion that "our elites seem to really not like their own fellow citizens" (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference_516a3c9c.txt), is highly unlikely to simultaneously appeal to universal dignity.

The most theoretically interesting and unexpected finding is the relatively weak negative correlation between **Justice** and **Resentment** (r = -0.31, n.s.). While the framework posits them as opposites, the data suggests they are not mutually exclusive in practice. This reflects a common populist strategy where calls for justice are powered by resentment. For example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's claim that billionaires are "stealing" wealth is a high-resentment statement used to justify a high-justice demand for them to pay "their fair share of taxes" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt). This pattern suggests that "justice" can be framed in two ways: a universal, impartial form (negatively correlated with resentment) and a retributive, grievance-based form (positively correlated with resentment). The CAF's ability to surface this ambiguity is a significant strength.

These patterns strongly support the framework's construct validity. The clear oppositional relationships and the coherent clustering of virtues and vices align perfectly with the theoretical underpinnings of the CAF. The framework appears to have an excellent fit with the corpus, successfully mapping the moral and ethical strategies employed in modern political speeches.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CAF demonstrates high discriminatory power. It clearly distinguishes between the rhetorical styles of different speakers and archetypes. For instance, the framework assigns a high **Pragmatism** score (0.95) to John McCain's concession speech and a very low score (0.10) to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's rally speech, which the model notes "lacks any acknowledgment of complexity, trade-offs, or practical constraints" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt). This capacity to differentiate between rhetorical approaches is a key indicator of its effectiveness.

The framework-corpus fit is strong. The dimensions of virtue and vice are not abstract categories but are clearly instantiated in the textual evidence. The analysis did not encounter significant passages of text that fell outside the framework's dimensions, suggesting its conceptual scheme is comprehensive for this type of discourse. Methodologically, the key insight is the power of an oppositional framework. By defining concepts in relation to their opposites, the CAF achieves a level of analytical precision and validation that a simple list of categories could not. The strong negative correlations are not just a finding; they are a confirmation of the framework's well-posed theoretical structure.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

This analysis carries significant implications for theories of political communication and democratic health. The clear statistical separation of political discourse into two opposing rhetorical clusters—"Principled Governance" and "Populist Grievance"—provides an empirical foundation for theories of affective polarization. The findings suggest that polarization is not merely a matter of policy disagreement but a clash of fundamental moral languages. The "Vice Cluster" (Tribalism, Resentment, Fear) appears to be the rhetorical engine of affective polarization, constructing a political world of existential threats and untrustworthy out-groups. As Steve King stated, "That's 135 dead Americans that would be alive today if the President didn't have the policy of releasing criminal, criminal aliens onto the streets" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor_738780d9.txt), a statement that fuses tribalism, fear, and resentment into a potent, polarizing narrative.

Furthermore, the nuanced relationship between **Justice** and **Resentment** complicates simplistic models of populist rhetoric. It suggests that populism's power may lie in its ability to co-opt the language of a core civic virtue (Justice) and infuse it with the energy of a powerful vice (Resentment). This hybrid appeal may be particularly effective, resonating with citizens' genuine sense of injustice while simultaneously activating more primal, divisive emotions. This finding suggests that future research should not treat these concepts as a simple binary but explore the strategic blending of virtue and vice in political messaging.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The CAF's discriminatory power allows for the identification of clear speaker archetypes, revealing the different ways political actors navigate the moral landscape.

1.  **The Institutionalist (McCain, Romney):** This archetype is characterized by high scores on the virtue cluster: Dignity, Justice, Truth, Hope, and Pragmatism. Their rhetoric emphasizes constitutional duty, respect for process, and appeals to a unified national identity. As Mitt Romney stated, "The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic’s success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment_9ebec73f.txt). This style is fundamentally oriented toward preserving the established norms of civic discourse.

2.  **The Populist (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, Vance, King):** This archetype scores highly on the vice cluster. Whether from the left (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) or the right (Vance, King), their strategy is structurally similar: they define a virtuous in-group (the people, working families, native-born citizens) and pit it against a corrupt out-group (oligarchs, billionaires, elites, illegal aliens). Their rhetoric is powered by **Resentment** over perceived injustices and **Fear** of the out-group's intentions. As J.D. Vance argued, "The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more" (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference_516a3c9c.txt).

3.  **The Bridging Figure (Booker, Lewis):** This archetype represents the most complex rhetorical strategy. These speakers score high on measures of grievance and fear but also on hope and justice. They acknowledge the legitimacy of the people's anger and fear but attempt to channel it toward a unifying, virtuous goal. Cory Booker, for instance, speaks of the "deeply savage, broken criminal justice system" (**Resentment**) but frames the solution as a bipartisan effort to "better reflect our collective values and ideals" (**Hope**, **Pragmatism**) (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act_0c32812a.txt). This style attempts to bridge the divide between grievance and governance.

### Broader Significance and Future Directions

This study demonstrates that computational methods, when guided by robust political theory, can move beyond simple sentiment analysis to a more profound "character analysis" of discourse. The CAF provides a valuable diagnostic tool for social scientists, journalists, and citizens to assess the quality of civic discourse. A political environment dominated by the "Vice Cluster" is likely one of high polarization and low trust, while one where the "Virtue Cluster" is more prevalent may be more conducive to compromise and collective problem-solving.

Future research should apply the CAF to a much larger, longitudinal corpus of political texts. This would allow for tracking the rise and fall of these rhetorical strategies over time, potentially correlating them with measures of political polarization, legislative gridlock, and public trust in institutions. Another promising avenue is to analyze the discourse of different media ecosystems (e.g., cable news, social media, mainstream print) to see if they preferentially amplify one rhetorical cluster over the other. Finally, experimental research could test the effects of exposure to "virtue-based" versus "vice-based" rhetoric on citizen attitudes and behaviors.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational social science analysis has successfully applied the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) to a corpus of political speeches, yielding significant insights into the moral character of political communication. The research confirmed the framework's theoretical soundness, demonstrating strong, consistent oppositions between posited virtues and vices. This validation establishes the CAF as a reliable instrument for measuring the ethical dimensions of rhetoric.

The study's primary contribution is the empirical identification of two polarized meta-strategies—"Principled Governance" and "Populist Grievance"—that structure much of contemporary political discourse. By moving beyond simple ideological labels, this analysis reveals the deeper moral-rhetorical structures that unite seemingly disparate political actors and drive affective polarization. The identification of distinct speaker archetypes—the Institutionalist, the Populist, and the Bridging Figure—provides a new vocabulary for understanding and comparing political styles.

Ultimately, this report demonstrates the power of combining humanistic theory with computational methods. The CAF provides a scalable, replicable, and theoretically grounded methodology to diagnose the health of our civic discourse. The findings, while based on a limited sample, point to a political environment where appeals to division, resentment, and fear are potent and prevalent. Yet, they also confirm that the language of dignity, justice, and hope remains a coherent and viable rhetorical alternative. The challenge for the future of democratic discourse, which this framework helps to clarify, is which of these languages will prevail.
