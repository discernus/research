## Part II: Interpretive Analysis

### Framework Description
The Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.3 provides a systematic approach to discourse analysis across multiple dimensions of social cohesion and discourse quality.

### Experiment Overview  
**Research Questions**: This experiment investigates patterns of social cohesion and fragmentation in political discourse using computational analysis.

**Methodology**: The analysis applies the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.3 to score discourse samples across multiple dimensions, followed by statistical analysis (descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and where applicable, ANOVA) to identify patterns and relationships. Evidence is then retrieved and synthesized to ground statistical findings in textual analysis.

### Evidence-Grounded Analysis
## Civic Character in Political Discourse: A CAF v7.3 Analysis

### Executive Summary

This report synthesizes findings from an analysis of eight political speeches using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.3. The primary objective was to evaluate the framework's capacity to differentiate speakers, identify distinct character signatures, and examine civic character coherence. The analytical approach was predominantly descriptive, utilizing statistical summaries of CAF dimension scores, salience, and confidence, alongside direct textual evidence from the speeches. The analysis supports the hypothesis that the CAF can reveal meaningful differences in character patterns among speakers, as indicated by variations in mean scores across multiple dimensions. For instance, the average `dignity_score` was 0.60 (SD: 0.29), while the average `fear_score` was 0.24 (SD: 0.12), highlighting observable differences in the expression of these civic character dimensions.

Furthermore, the study found that speeches exhibit distinct character signatures, characterized by differing configurations of virtues and vices. This is evidenced by the general trend of higher mean scores for virtue dimensions (e.g., `hope_score` = 0.54, SD: 0.21) compared to pathology dimensions (e.g., `resentment_score` = 0.38, SD: 0.18). The analysis also supports the hypothesis of varying civic character coherence, as suggested by differences in dimension scores and observed patterns such as \"Incoherent Messaging,\" indicated by high variance in dimension scores (e.g., `dimension_variance` for dignity: 0.29 vs. fantasy: 0.05). Textual evidence provides qualitative depth to these statistical observations, illustrating specific rhetorical strategies employed by speakers.

### Methodology

This analysis employed the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.3 to systematically evaluate the civic character of eight political speeches. The framework assesses discourse across five bipolar axes: Dignity vs. Tribalism, Truth vs. Manipulation, Justice vs. Resentment, Hope vs. Fear, and Pragmatism vs. Fantasy. Each dimension is scored on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, with associated salience and confidence ratings. The primary analytical approach was descriptive statistics, examining means, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation to understand score distributions and variability. Inferential statistical tests were not applicable due to the aggregated nature of the provided data. Textual evidence, consisting of direct quotes from the speeches, was integrated with statistical findings to provide qualitative support and contextualize the quantitative results, adhering to the experimental hypotheses regarding speaker differentiation, character signatures, and civic character coherence.

### Results

**H1: Speaker Differentiation via CAF Dimensions**

The descriptive statistics reveal considerable variation across the CAF dimensions, supporting the hypothesis that the framework can differentiate speaker character profiles. For example, the mean `dignity_score` across the speeches was 0.60 (SD: 0.29), contrasting with a lower mean `fear_score` of 0.24 (SD: 0.12). Similarly, `tribalism_score` averaged 0.40 (SD: 0.19), while `fantasy_score` averaged 0.14 (SD: 0.05). This variation in average scores and dispersion across dimensions suggests that different speakers manifest distinct character patterns. For instance, John McCain's 2008 concession speech, marked by an appeal to unity, contained the statement, "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt), which aligns with higher dignity scores and lower tribalism.

**H2: Distinct Character Signatures Across Virtues and Vices**

The analysis supports the presence of distinct character signatures, as evidenced by the varying prominence of virtues and vices. The average `virtue_index` (calculated from dignity, truth, justice, hope, pragmatism) generally exceeded the `pathology_index` (calculated from tribalism, manipulation, resentment, fear, fantasy). Specifically, the mean `hope_score` was 0.54 (SD: 0.21) with a salience of 0.59 (SD: 0.22), indicating a notable presence of hope in the discourse. Conversely, the `fear_score` was considerably lower at 0.24 (SD: 0.12) with a salience of 0.32 (SD: 0.10). Textual evidence highlights these contrasts. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's speech included the assertion, "Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), reflecting a high dignity appeal. In contrast, the provided text snippets did not offer direct examples of high fear scores, suggesting a tendency away from fear-based rhetoric in this corpus, aligning with the lower statistical findings for fear.

**H3: Variation in Civic Character Coherence Patterns**

The hypothesis regarding variation in civic character coherence is supported by the observed differences in dimension scores and identified strategic patterns. For example, the `dimension_variance` for `dignity_score` was 0.29, whereas for `fantasy_score` it was 0.05, indicating that dignity appeals were expressed with greater variability across speeches than fantasy appeals. This variation contributes to the classification of \"Incoherent Messaging\" when dimension scores differ significantly. Mitt Romney's speech regarding his impeachment vote included, "I sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt), demonstrating a complex interplay of truth-seeking and obligation, which could lead to high dimension variance and potentially incoherent messaging. Similarly, J.D. Vance's 2022 NatCon conference speech also exhibited high variance, as noted in the previous findings, suggesting a mixed character profile. The finding that \"Instances where pragmatism salience is low and fantasy salience is high, indicating unrealistic promises or constraint denial\" were identified, suggests that some speeches actively engaged in \"Strategic Pathology.\"

### Framework Fit Assessment

The CAF v7.3 demonstrated moderate performance across the analyzed speeches, primarily assessed through descriptive statistics. Most dimensions exhibited moderate dispersion, as indicated by coefficients of variation (CV) generally ranging from 0.30 to 0.50. For example, `dignity_score` had a CV of 0.49, and `tribalism_score` had a CV of 0.48, suggesting a reasonable spread of scores. However, the `truth_salience` (CV: 0.25), `pragmatism_score` (CV: 0.30), `pragmatism_salience` (CV: 0.31), and `fantasy_salience` (CV: 0.33) showed lower dispersion, indicating less variability in how these dimensions were expressed across the corpus.

Confidence in scoring varied. `dignity_confidence` (0.76) and `tribalism_confidence` (0.71) were notably higher than `fear_confidence` (0.55) and `fantasy_confidence` (0.44). This lower confidence for fear and fantasy dimensions suggests potential challenges in consistently applying the framework to these aspects, possibly due to less clear linguistic markers or more nuanced expressions in the speeches. For instance, the low `fear_score` (0.24) and `fear_salience` (0.32) might reflect a subtle deployment of fear, making it harder to score with high confidence. The analysis of Mitt Romney's statement on seeking testimony to \"raise reasonable doubt\" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt) highlights the complexity in scoring the truth dimension, where the *process* of truth-seeking might be more prominent than direct factual assertions, leading to a moderate `truth_score` (0.46) but higher `truth_salience` (0.58).

### Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the utility of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.3 in identifying and differentiating patterns of civic character within political discourse. The descriptive statistics confirm the presence of variation in how speakers engage with virtues and vices, supporting the core hypotheses of the experiment. Speakers exhibit distinct character signatures, with some tending towards higher virtue appeals (e.g., dignity, hope) and others revealing more pathological dimensions.

The findings indicate that while concepts like dignity are frequently invoked with high salience and confidence (e.g., John McCain's statement, "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt)), other dimensions, such as fear and fantasy, present greater analytical challenges, evidenced by lower confidence scores and less pronounced salience. The presence of \"Incoherent Messaging,\" as seen in Mitt Romney's complex statement regarding impeachment testimony (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt), underscores the framework's ability to capture nuanced and sometimes contradictory rhetorical strategies. Further refinement of the framework's application to dimensions like fear and fantasy, potentially through enhanced linguistic marker identification or broader data corpus analysis, could improve its diagnostic power for these complex areas of political communication.

### Framework Fit Assessment
The CAF v7.3 demonstrated moderate performance across the analyzed speeches, primarily assessed through descriptive statistics. Most dimensions exhibited moderate dispersion, as indicated by coefficients of variation (CV) generally ranging from 0.30 to 0.50. For example, `dignity_score` had a CV of 0.49, and `tribalism_score` had a CV of 0.48, suggesting a reasonable spread of scores. However, the `truth_salience` (CV: 0.25), `pragmatism_score` (CV: 0.30), `pragmatism_salience` (CV: 0.31), and `fantasy_salience` (CV: 0.33) showed lower dispersion, indicating less variability in how these dimensions were expressed across the corpus.

Confidence in scoring varied. `dignity_confidence` (0.76) and `tribalism_confidence` (0.71) were notably higher than `fear_confidence` (0.55) and `fantasy_confidence` (0.44). This lower confidence for fear and fantasy dimensions suggests potential challenges in consistently applying the framework to these aspects, possibly due to less clear linguistic markers or more nuanced expressions in the speeches. For instance, the low `fear_score` (0.24) and `fear_salience` (0.32) might reflect a subtle deployment of fear, making it harder to score with high confidence. The analysis of Mitt Romney's statement on seeking testimony to \"raise reasonable doubt\" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt) highlights the complexity in scoring the truth dimension, where the *process* of truth-seeking might be more prominent than direct factual assertions, leading to a moderate `truth_score` (0.46) but higher `truth_salience` (0.58).
