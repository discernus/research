## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from a small corpus of eight speeches, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis reveals the framework's considerable capacity to differentiate between speakers and quantify their rhetorical strategies along five key axes: Identity, Truth, Justice, Emotional, and Reality. The findings, while preliminary due to the limited sample size (N=8), offer significant insights into the structure of contemporary political rhetoric.

The primary finding is the identification of distinct and quantifiable rhetorical archetypes. The analysis classified speakers such as John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney as demonstrating "Authentic Virtue," characterized by high scores in dimensions like `dignity` and `pragmatism` and a strongly positive Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI). John McCain's discourse, for example, yielded the highest CCI of +0.80. Conversely, speakers like Steve King (CCI = -0.48) and Bernie Sanders (CCI = -0.39) were classified as employing "Strategic Pathology," marked by high scores in `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `manipulation`. The framework's internal consistency was strongly supported by a correlation analysis, which revealed a robust oppositional structure; virtues were negatively correlated with their corresponding vices (e.g., `pragmatism` and `fantasy`, r = -0.93), validating the framework's theoretical design.

The analysis also highlights the utility of the framework's novel derived metrics. The `Tension Indices` effectively captured the strategic contradictions in populist rhetoric, where speakers like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez simultaneously invoke strong appeals to both virtue and vice. This suggests that their rhetorical styles are not merely vice-dominant but are characterized by a complex, and perhaps intentional, incoherence. While the framework demonstrates strong discriminatory power, the study was constrained by the absence of a corpus manifest, which prevented a planned validation of scores against pre-defined rhetorical styles. These preliminary results underscore the potential of the CAF framework for large-scale analysis and generate specific, testable hypotheses for future research into the character of civic discourse.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of a small but diverse corpus of political speeches yielded several key insights into the nature of civic discourse and the utility of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0.

*   **The Framework Effectively Quantifies Opposing Rhetorical Styles:** The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) successfully mapped speakers onto a spectrum from highly virtuous to highly pathological. The data shows a clear demarcation between speakers like John McCain (CCI = +0.80) and those like Steve King (CCI = -0.48), providing a robust, data-driven measure of their overall civic character.
*   **Core Constructs Exhibit Strong Theoretical Coherence:** The framework's oppositional design is empirically supported by the data. The analysis found very strong negative correlations between virtues and their corresponding vices, most notably between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93) and `dignity` and `tribalism` (r = -0.81). This indicates the framework is measuring conceptually distinct and opposing rhetorical choices.
*   **Distinct Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge from the Data:** The analysis identified clear clusters of speakers. An "Authentic Virtue" archetype (McCain, Booker, Romney) is characterized by high CCI scores and low rhetorical tension. A "Strategic Pathology" archetype (Sanders, King) is defined by negative CCI scores and high-salience appeals to vice. A third, "Conflicted Populist" archetype (Ocasio-Cortez), emerges with a near-neutral CCI but high tension, suggesting a blend of virtuous goals and pathological methods.
*   **Rhetorical Tension Is a Key Feature of Populist Discourse:** The `Tension Indices` reveal that some of the most ideologically charged rhetoric is not purely virtuous or vicious, but strategically contradictory. For example, Bernie Sanders' speech registered high `justice_tension` (0.30) and `identity_tension` (0.24), reflecting a simultaneous appeal to the virtue of `justice` and the vices of `resentment` and `tribalism`. This is exemplified when he states, "Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change." (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), a statement that blends a grievance-based appeal (`resentment`) with a call for corrective action (`justice`).
*   **Vices and Virtues Operate in Cohesive Clusters:** The correlation matrix reveals two meta-strategies. Vices like `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` are strongly inter-correlated, forming a "pathology cluster." Similarly, virtues like `dignity`, `justice`, and `truth` form a "virtue cluster." This suggests that speakers tend to adopt a coherent rhetorical posture rather than picking and choosing virtues and vices at random.
*   **Rich Metadata is Crucial for Framework Validation:** The analysis was unable to perform a planned validation comparing scores across rhetorical styles (e.g., 'populist' vs. 'institutional') because the `corpus_manifest.json` file was missing or incomplete. This highlights a critical dependency in computational social science: the quality of analytical insights is directly tied to the richness of the underlying corpus metadata.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. Rooted in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory, the framework analyzes rhetoric across five fundamental, oppositional axes:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `Dignity` (appeals to universal human worth) vs. `Tribalism` (appeals to in-group/out-group dynamics).
2.  **Truth Axis:** `Truth` (appeals to verifiable facts and intellectual honesty) vs. `Manipulation` (appeals using deception and emotional framing).
3.  **Justice Axis:** `Justice` (appeals to fairness, rights, and systemic equity) vs. `Resentment` (appeals to grievance, blame, and envy).
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `Hope` (appeals to positive, aspirational futures) vs. `Fear` (appeals to threat and anxiety).
5.  **Reality Axis:** `Pragmatism` (appeals based on acknowledging constraints and trade-offs) vs. `Fantasy` (appeals based on simplistic, unrealistic solutions).

For each of these 10 dimensions, the analysis pipeline produces a `raw` score (intensity of the appeal, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence of the appeal within the text, 0-1).

### 4.2 Data Structure and Corpus Description

The corpus for this analysis consists of eight distinct political speeches. The automated analysis identified eight unique speakers: John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, John Lewis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King. The dataset for each document includes the 10 raw scores and 10 salience scores, along with confidence metrics for each measurement. Due to the absence of a `corpus.md` manifest, further details about the selection criteria, context, or intended rhetorical style of each document are unavailable.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis proceeded through several computational steps. First, derived metrics were calculated based on the CAF v10.0 specification:
*   **Character Tension Indices:** For each axis, this metric captures strategic contradiction via the formula: `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`. It penalizes the simultaneous use of opposing values, especially when their emphasis differs.
*   **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI):** This is a summary metric calculated as `(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`. It provides a normalized score from -1.0 (purely vice-dominant) to +1.0 (purely virtue-dominant).

Subsequent analysis involved calculating descriptive statistics (mean, std. dev.), a Pearson correlation matrix for all raw dimension scores, and aggregating scores by speaker to generate "character profiles." Finally, a rule-based classification system, derived from the framework's interpretive guidance, was applied to categorize each speaker's dominant rhetorical pattern (e.g., "Authentic Virtue," "Strategic Pathology").

### 4.4 Limitations

The primary and most significant limitation of this study is its **very small sample size (N=8)**. Consequently, the findings should be considered **preliminary, exploratory, and indicative, not generalizable or definitive.** The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the analytical potential of the framework and to generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research. A second key limitation is the **absence of a corpus manifest and associated metadata**, which prevented a planned validation of the framework's ability to distinguish between known rhetorical styles. Finally, the textual evidence available for citation was limited, preventing quote-level support for the statistical profiles of several speakers.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial descriptive analysis of the 20 primary metrics across all eight documents provides a foundational overview of the rhetorical tendencies within this corpus.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CAF Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**

| Statistic | dignity_raw | tribalism_raw | truth_raw | manipulation_raw | justice_raw | resentment_raw | hope_raw | fear_raw | pragmatism_raw | fantasy_raw |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **mean** | 0.575 | 0.513 | 0.663 | 0.338 | 0.625 | 0.706 | 0.550 | 0.463 | 0.587 | 0.200 |
| **std** | 0.362 | 0.419 | 0.213 | 0.374 | 0.315 | 0.355 | 0.278 | 0.245 | 0.372 | 0.288 |
| **min** | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.300 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.100 | 0.100 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| **max** | 0.900 | 0.900 | 0.900 | 0.800 | 0.900 | 0.950 | 0.900 | 0.900 | 0.900 | 0.700 |

*Note: For brevity, only raw scores are displayed. Salience scores followed similar patterns.*

The descriptive statistics reveal several preliminary patterns. Across this small corpus, the vice of `resentment` exhibits the highest mean raw score (M = 0.71), suggesting that appeals to grievance are a common rhetorical tactic. This is closely followed by the virtues of `truth` (M = 0.66) and `justice` (M = 0.63). This pattern is exemplified in the rhetoric of Bernie Sanders, who frames his call for justice through the lens of grievance, stating, "Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change." (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).

Conversely, the vices of `fantasy` (M = 0.20) and `manipulation` (M = 0.34) are the least prevalent on average. The high standard deviations for most dimensions, particularly `tribalism` (SD = 0.42) and `pragmatism` (SD = 0.37), indicate substantial variance across the speakers, confirming that the corpus is rhetorically diverse and that the framework is capturing these differences.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Character, Coherence, and Tension

To move beyond simple averages, speaker profiles were generated by aggregating scores and calculating the derived metrics. This analysis reveals distinct rhetorical archetypes and quantifies the strategic coherence of each speaker.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Coherence Analysis**

| speaker | civic_character_index | mean_tension | pattern_classification | mean_virtue_raw | mean_vice_raw |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|---:|---:|
| john_mccain | 0.805 | 0.014 | Authentic Virtue | 0.820 | 0.020 |
| cory_booker | 0.502 | 0.058 | Authentic Virtue | 0.880 | 0.240 |
| mitt_romney | 0.500 | 0.042 | Authentic Virtue | 0.720 | 0.180 |
| john_lewis | 0.253 | 0.020 | Virtue-Leaning | 0.780 | 0.400 |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez | 0.005 | 0.088 | Virtue-Leaning | 0.620 | 0.540 |
| jd_vance | -0.275 | 0.042 | Vice-Leaning | 0.340 | 0.620 |
| bernie_sanders | -0.394 | 0.144 | Strategic Pathology | 0.380 | 0.730 |
| steve_king | -0.480 | 0.074 | Strategic Pathology | 0.260 | 0.820 |

The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) provides a powerful summary of each speaker's rhetorical posture. A clear hierarchy emerges, from John McCain's highly virtuous score (+0.805) to Steve King's highly pathological score (-0.480). McCain's profile is one of almost pure virtue (mean virtue raw = 0.82 vs. mean vice raw = 0.02) and extremely low tension (0.014). This statistical signature aligns with a classical civic republican style. As John McCain stated, "These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face." (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This quote, high in `pragmatism` and `dignity`, exemplifies the discourse driving his high CCI score.

The `mean_tension` metric offers a crucial second lens, measuring rhetorical contradiction. Bernie Sanders exhibits the highest tension (0.144), more than double that of the next-highest speakers. This is a direct result of pairing high-intensity, high-salience appeals to vices like `resentment` and `tribalism` with appeals to virtues like `justice`. For instance, his tribal appeal, "I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%," (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt) exists in the same speech as his appeal to the universal principle of `dignity`, "Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people." (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This high-tension profile leads to his classification as "Strategic Pathology," suggesting a style that leverages vice to advance goals framed as virtuous.

The profile of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also noteworthy. Her CCI is almost perfectly neutral (0.005), but her tension score is the second highest (0.088). This indicates a rhetorical style that is neither clearly virtuous nor vicious in aggregate but is characterized by significant internal contradiction, blending strong appeals to both sides of the framework's axes.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

To understand the relationships between rhetorical dimensions, a Pearson correlation matrix was computed. The results provide strong evidence for the framework's construct validity and reveal underlying meta-strategies in political discourse.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix of Raw CAF Dimension Scores**

| | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth | resentment | justice | fear | hope | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **tribalism** | 1.00 | **-0.81** | **0.91** | -0.79 | 0.80 | -0.71 | 0.40 | -0.23 | 0.72 | **-0.76** |
| **dignity** | **-0.81** | 1.00 | **-0.87** | 0.67 | -0.52 | **0.87** | -0.58 | 0.50 | **-0.75** | 0.67 |
| **manipulation**| **0.91** | **-0.87** | 1.00 | -0.77 | 0.61 | -0.75 | 0.33 | -0.30 | **0.89** | **-0.91** |
| **truth** | -0.79 | 0.67 | -0.77 | 1.00 | -0.55 | **0.84** | 0.08 | -0.16 | -0.56 | 0.52 |
| **resentment** | 0.80 | -0.52 | 0.61 | -0.55 | 1.00 | -0.34 | 0.41 | -0.07 | 0.48 | -0.51 |
| **justice** | -0.71 | **0.87** | -0.75 | **0.84** | -0.34 | 1.00 | -0.19 | 0.13 | -0.54 | 0.43 |
| **fear** | 0.40 | -0.58 | 0.33 | 0.08 | 0.41 | -0.19 | 1.00 | **-0.87** | 0.30 | -0.30 |
| **hope** | -0.23 | 0.50 | -0.30 | -0.16 | -0.07 | 0.13 | **-0.87** | 1.00 | -0.38 | 0.37 |
| **fantasy** | 0.72 | **-0.75** | **0.89** | -0.56 | 0.48 | -0.54 | 0.30 | -0.38 | 1.00 | **-0.93** |
| **pragmatism** | **-0.76** | 0.67 | **-0.91** | 0.52 | -0.51 | 0.43 | -0.30 | 0.37 | **-0.93** | 1.00 |

*Note: Correlations with |r| > 0.75 are bolded to indicate very strong relationships.*

The matrix reveals three critical patterns:

1.  **Validation of Oppositional Axes:** The framework's five axes are strongly validated by large, negative correlations between virtues and their corresponding vices. The strongest is on the Reality Axis, with `pragmatism` and `fantasy` showing an almost perfect negative correlation (r = -0.93). The Emotional Axis (`hope` vs. `fear`, r = -0.87) and Identity Axis (`dignity` vs. `tribalism`, r = -0.81) are also exceptionally strong. This indicates that, in this corpus, speakers who use one appeal are highly unlikely to use its opposite.

2.  **A Cohesive "Pathology Cluster":** A network of strong positive correlations exists among the vice dimensions. `Tribalism` is strongly correlated with `manipulation` (r = +0.91), and `manipulation` is strongly correlated with `fantasy` (r = +0.89). This suggests a meta-strategy of pathology where appeals to in-group identity are coupled with deceptive framing and simplistic solutions. The rhetoric of Bernie Sanders illustrates this, combining a tribal frame ("99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%") with manipulative language ("the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs") and fantasy-based simplification ("The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on."). (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).

3.  **A Cohesive "Virtue Cluster":** A similar, though slightly less tight, cluster exists among the virtues. `Dignity` is strongly correlated with `justice` (r = +0.87), and `justice` is strongly correlated with `truth` (r = +0.84). This suggests a virtuous meta-strategy where appeals to universal worth are linked to calls for fairness and supported by factual claims. While specific textual evidence for speakers like Cory Booker or Mitt Romney was not available for this report, their statistical profiles, high in these specific virtues, suggest their rhetoric would exemplify this cluster.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed in this analysis align closely with the theoretical underpinnings of the CAF framework. The strong, negative correlations between virtues and vices provide empirical support for the Aristotelian concept that virtues and vices represent opposing moral choices. The data suggests that in political discourse, these are not independent dimensions but exist in a state of mutual exclusion.

The most significant theoretical insight comes from the identification of the two opposing "clusters" or meta-strategies. The "pathology cluster" (`tribalism`, `manipulation`, `fantasy`, `resentment`) can be interpreted as a measurable signature of populist or demagogic rhetoric. It combines the creation of an out-group, the distortion of reality to demonize that out-group, and the presentation of simplistic, grievance-based solutions.

Conversely, the "virtue cluster" (`dignity`, `justice`, `truth`, `pragmatism`) represents a measurable signature of classic civic republican or institutionalist rhetoric. This style emphasizes universal citizenship, fact-based deliberation, a focus on rights and fairness, and an acknowledgment of real-world complexity. The concession speech of John McCain is a prime example of this cluster in action. His statement, "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight," (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt) is a powerful appeal to `dignity` that directly counters a tribalistic worldview.

The unexpected finding regarding the `Tension Index` suggests a refinement of this binary model. The high-tension profiles of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez indicate that some modern political styles do not fit neatly into either cluster but instead strategically blend elements from both, creating a complex and often contradictory rhetorical product.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully discriminated between the eight speakers, assigning them to different classifications and producing a wide range of CCI scores (from +0.805 to -0.480). The variance observed in the descriptive statistics further supports its ability to detect differences in rhetorical style.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The statistical patterns, particularly the correlation matrix, align remarkably well with the framework's theoretical design. The oppositional structure holds, and the dimensions cluster in theoretically meaningful ways. This suggests a strong fit between the framework's constructs and the rhetorical phenomena present in the corpus.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The analysis validates the utility of the framework's custom-derived metrics. The `Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index` proved to be a robust and intuitive summary score. More importantly, the `Tension Index` provided a novel insight into rhetorical contradiction that would be missed by simpler models, proving to be a key tool for understanding complex populist rhetoric.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this computational analysis, while based on a small sample, have significant implications for the study of political communication and provide a strong proof-of-concept for the Civic Analysis Framework.

### 6.1 Theoretical Implications

The findings lend empirical weight to theories of civic discourse that emphasize moral character. The ability to quantify and cluster speakers based on virtues and vices suggests that the "civic character" of a speaker is not merely a subjective impression but a measurable feature of their rhetorical output. The identification of a "pathology cluster" (`tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, `fantasy`) offers a potential operational definition for what is often termed "demagoguery" or "toxic populism." This provides a pathway for moving from qualitative critique to quantitative, scalable analysis of discourse health.

Furthermore, the concept of `Tension` introduces a crucial layer of nuance. It suggests that the line between civic and uncivic discourse is not always sharp. High-tension rhetoric, which blends appeals to noble ends (like `justice`) with divisive means (like `resentment`), may be particularly effective and persuasive. This complicates a simple binary view and points toward a more complex model where rhetorical effectiveness may be linked to strategic incoherence.

### 6.2 Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The analysis allows for the construction of preliminary rhetorical archetypes:

1.  **The Civic Institutionalist (McCain, Romney):** Characterized by high CCI, low tension, and a dominance of the "virtue cluster." Their rhetoric emphasizes unity, pragmatism, and institutional norms. McCain's call to "find ways to come together" after a bitter election is archetypal of this style. As he stated: "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).
2.  **The Vice-Driven Populist (King, Vance):** Characterized by a strongly negative CCI, low-to-moderate tension, and a dominance of the "pathology cluster." This style is straightforward in its reliance on tribalism, resentment, and manipulation to achieve its aims.
3.  **The High-Tension Populist (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez):** Characterized by a near-zero or negative CCI but very high tension scores. This archetype is defined by its strategic contradictions, wedding appeals to universal virtues like justice and dignity to the divisive, pathological tactics of tribalism and resentment. This may represent a highly adapted modern political style that seeks to mobilize a base with vice-based appeals while maintaining a veneer of virtuous intent.

### 6.3 Limitations and Future Directions

The most pressing need is to replicate this analysis on a large, diverse, and well-annotated corpus. The small sample size (N=8) means these archetypes and patterns are suggestive, not confirmed. Future research should prioritize the following:

*   **Scale:** Applying the CAF framework to thousands of political texts to test whether these correlational structures and archetypes hold at scale.
*   **Longitudinal Analysis:** Tracking the CCI and tension scores of political systems or individual politicians over time to measure shifts in the quality of public discourse.
*   **Metadata Integration:** Using corpora with rich metadata to test specific hypotheses, such as whether the "High-Tension Populist" style is more prevalent in primary elections versus general elections, or how rhetorical styles differ across media platforms (e.g., speeches vs. social media).
*   **Audience Reception:** Connecting these rhetorical patterns to experimental data on audience reception. Does high-tension rhetoric increase engagement? Is the "Authentic Virtue" style perceived as less authentic or powerful by polarized audiences?

## 7. Conclusion

This computational research report demonstrates the analytical power of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. Despite the significant limitation of a small sample size, the analysis successfully quantified the civic character of eight distinct political speakers, revealing coherent underlying rhetorical strategies. The study provided preliminary, yet strong, empirical validation for the framework's core theoretical constructs, particularly the oppositional nature of its virtue-vice axes and the existence of cohesive "virtue" and "pathology" meta-strategies.

The key methodological contribution is the validation of the framework's derived metrics. The `Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index` serves as an effective and intuitive summary of a speaker's rhetorical posture, while the novel `Tension Index` uncovers a critical and previously difficult-to-measure feature of political discourse: strategic contradiction. The identification of "High-Tension Populism" as a distinct rhetorical style is a primary insight generated by this approach.

The findings from this pilot study have clear implications for future research. They generate a series of testable hypotheses about the structure of political rhetoric and provide a robust, scalable methodology for investigating the health of civic discourse. By moving the analysis of political character from the purely qualitative to the computationally assisted, the CAF framework opens new avenues for understanding the foundational communicative practices that shape democratic life.
