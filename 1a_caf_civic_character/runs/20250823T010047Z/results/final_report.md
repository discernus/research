## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational social science analysis of a small corpus (N=8) of political discourse using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis aimed to evaluate the civic character of the discourse by measuring the presence and salience of five key virtue-vice pairings: Truth vs. Manipulation, Justice vs. Resentment, Hope vs. Fear, Dignity vs. Tribalism, and Pragmatism vs. Fantasy. The findings, while exploratory due to the limited sample size, reveal a distinct and complex rhetorical profile.

The analysis indicates that the discourse is dominated by a narrative of **aggrieved righteousness**. The most prominent rhetorical features were high appeals to **Resentment** (Mean Raw Score = 0.68), **Truth** (M=0.65), and **Justice** (M=0.64). This suggests a communication style focused on highlighting perceived injustices and positioning the speaker as a purveyor of truth against these wrongs. This core theme is emotionally charged, with significant, though secondary, appeals to both **Hope** (M=0.60) and **Fear** (M=0.48), indicating a strategy that frames the future in terms of both high stakes and potential salvation. Notably, appeals to **Manipulation** (M=0.35) and **Fantasy** (M=0.31) were the least prevalent, suggesting the discourse aims for an appearance of grounded, truthful argumentation.

Methodologically, the analysis was conducted with exceptionally high analytical confidence across all dimensions (average confidence > 0.87), indicating the underlying model's certainty in its classifications. However, the study is constrained by a small sample size (N=8) and the absence of a correlation matrix, which prevents definitive statistical inference and validation of the framework's oppositional constructs. Furthermore, the lack of associated textual evidence precludes qualitative grounding of these quantitative findings. Despite these limitations, the analysis demonstrates the potential of the CAF to deconstruct complex political rhetoric and generate testable hypotheses about communication strategies.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Discourse is Primarily Driven by Resentment and Justice:** The two most powerful emotional drivers in the analyzed text are **Resentment** (M=0.68) and **Justice** (M=0.64). This pairing suggests a rhetorical strategy that simultaneously stokes grievance while framing it as a righteous crusade, a potent combination for political mobilization.
*   **Appeals to Truth Dominate over Deception:** Speakers in this corpus strongly favor explicit appeals to **Truth** (M=0.65) over its pathological counterpart, **Manipulation** (M=0.35). This indicates a strategic preference for presenting arguments as fact-based and transparent, even when embedded within a highly emotional, resentment-fueled narrative.
*   **The Future is Framed by a Tension Between Hope and Fear:** The discourse utilizes a dual-pronged emotional appeal regarding the future, with significant expressions of both **Hope** (M=0.60) and **Fear** (M=0.48). This suggests a strategy of motivating audiences by presenting both a utopian vision to strive for and a dystopian outcome to avoid.
*   **Pragmatism Outweighs Fantasy:** The communication style is more grounded in perceived reality than in escapism. Appeals to **Pragmatism** (M=0.51) are notably more frequent than appeals to **Fantasy** (M=0.31), reinforcing the discourse's self-presentation as serious and solution-oriented.
*   **Analytical Certainty is High Despite Rhetorical Complexity:** The CAF model registered consistently high confidence scores across all 10 dimensions (all means > 0.87, average = 0.91). This suggests that while the discourse is a complex mix of virtues and vices, the signals for each are clear and reliably classifiable by the framework.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This analysis is grounded in the **Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0**, which draws from two major streams of political theory: **Aristotelian virtue ethics** and **contemporary civic republicanism**. Aristotelian ethics posits that character is central to politics and that virtuous action (the mean between extremes) is essential for a flourishing political community (*polis*). Civic republicanism, in turn, emphasizes the importance of civic virtue among citizens as a bulwark against corruption, domination, and tyranny. It argues that a republic's health depends on citizens who prioritize the common good, practice virtues like justice and courage, and engage in robust public deliberation.

The CAF operationalizes these concepts by structuring political discourse as a series of tensions between competing virtues and their corresponding vices or "pathologies." This approach moves beyond a simple "good vs. bad" dichotomy to a more nuanced evaluation of rhetorical strategy. The five pairs identified in the framework represent core tensions in democratic life:

*   **Truth vs. Manipulation:** The tension between honest, transparent communication and the use of deception, sophistry, or strategic ambiguity to achieve political ends.
*   **Justice vs. Resentment:** The conflict between appeals to impartial fairness and the common good versus the stoking of grievance, envy, and a desire for retribution against perceived enemies.
*   **Hope vs. Fear:** The strategic choice between inspiring citizens with a positive vision for the future and motivating them through anxiety and threats.
*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism:** The opposition between rhetoric that respects the inherent worth of all individuals (including opponents) and language that promotes in-group loyalty at the expense of out-group dehumanization.
*   **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy:** The contrast between arguments grounded in practical realities and constraints and those that rely on unrealistic, utopian, or conspiratorial narratives.

By measuring these dimensions, this study assesses not just *what* is being said, but *how* it is being said, providing insight into the moral character of the discourse and its potential effects on the health of the democratic public sphere.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employed the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 to conduct a quantitative analysis of a political discourse corpus. The CAF is an oppositional framework designed to measure the civic character of communication by evaluating it along five axes, each defined by a virtue and its corresponding vice. For each of the ten core dimensions, the analysis produced three metrics:

1.  **Raw Score:** The measured presence of the dimension in a given document.
2.  **Salience Score:** The prominence or importance of the dimension within the document's overall rhetoric.
3.  **Confidence Score:** The analytical model's certainty (from 0 to 1) in its classification for that dimension.

The analytical approach for this report is primarily descriptive and exploratory. Given the dataset's characteristics, the analysis focuses on interpreting descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) to identify the central tendencies and overall rhetorical profile of the corpus.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The complete research data was provided as a JSON object containing summary statistics from a computational analysis. The analysis was performed on a corpus of **8 documents** (N=8). The metadata indicates the analysis was completed on August 22, 2025, with a statistical significance level (alpha) set to 0.05 for the underlying process. The content, origin, and nature of these 8 documents were not specified.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis is based on the descriptive statistics provided in the `calculate_basic_statistics` output. No new inferential tests were performed. The core of the analysis involves comparing the mean scores of the opposing virtue-vice pairs to understand the dominant rhetorical strategies within the sample.

This study is subject to several significant methodological limitations:

1.  **Extremely Small Sample Size:** With N=8, the findings cannot be generalized to any broader population of political discourse. The results are descriptive of this specific, small sample only and should be considered preliminary and hypothesis-generating.
2.  **Absence of Correlation Data:** The provided data did not include a correlation matrix. This prevents a direct statistical test of the CAF's central theoretical assumption: that the virtue-vice pairs are negatively correlated (e.g., high Truth scores should correlate with low Manipulation scores). This is a critical component for validating the framework's construct validity.
3.  **Lack of Textual Evidence:** The research data did not contain any textual excerpts from the source documents. A critical requirement of the analysis was to integrate qualitative evidence (quotes) to support and contextualize quantitative findings. As this evidence was unavailable, this requirement could not be met. This limits the analysis to a purely statistical interpretation and prevents a deeper, more nuanced understanding of *how* these rhetorical strategies were deployed in language.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics for the ten dimensions across the eight documents are summarized below. The data reveals the central tendencies and variability of each rhetorical feature within the corpus. The analysis was conducted with a high degree of model confidence across all dimensions.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics of Civic Dimensions (N=8)**

| Dimension Pair | Virtue/Vice | Mean Raw Score | Std. Dev. | Mean Salience | Mean Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Justice vs. Resentment** | Resentment | **0.68** | 0.39 | **0.70** | 0.94 |
| | Justice | 0.64 | 0.35 | 0.66 | 0.91 |
| **Truth vs. Manipulation** | Truth | **0.65** | 0.21 | **0.71** | 0.88 |
| | Manipulation | 0.35 | 0.38 | 0.40 | 0.91 |
| **Hope vs. Fear** | Hope | **0.60** | 0.24 | **0.63** | 0.88 |
| | Fear | 0.48 | 0.32 | 0.52 | 0.90 |
| **Dignity vs. Tribalism** | Dignity | **0.58** | 0.37 | 0.58 | 0.91 |
| | Tribalism | 0.51 | 0.40 | 0.59 | 0.95 |
| **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy** | Pragmatism | **0.51** | 0.39 | 0.48 | 0.92 |
| | Fantasy | 0.31 | 0.35 | 0.33 | 0.92 |

**Interpretation of Dimensional Patterns:**

*   **Justice vs. Resentment:** This is the most prominent axis in the discourse. Both dimensions score very high, but **Resentment** (M=0.68) is slightly more pronounced than **Justice** (M=0.64). The high standard deviations for both (0.39 and 0.35, respectively) suggest significant variance across the documents, meaning some may be heavily justice-focused while others are driven by resentment. The overall picture is one of intense focus on righting perceived wrongs.

*   **Truth vs. Manipulation:** There is a clear preference for the virtue in this pair. **Truth** (M=0.65) is expressed at nearly double the rate of **Manipulation** (M=0.35). This suggests a rhetorical posture of transparency and facticity. The low standard deviation for Truth (0.21) indicates it is a consistent feature across the corpus, while Manipulation is more variable.

*   **Hope vs. Fear:** This pair shows a slight preference for the virtue, with **Hope** (M=0.60) appearing more frequently than **Fear** (M=0.48). However, both are present at significant levels, indicating a complex emotional landscape where positive future visions are presented alongside warnings of potential negative outcomes.

*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism:** This is the most balanced and contested pair. The mean scores for **Dignity** (M=0.58) and **Tribalism** (M=0.51) are very close. The salience scores are even closer, with Tribalism (M=0.59) slightly edging out Dignity (M=0.58). This suggests a deep tension in the discourse between respecting universal human worth and reinforcing in-group/out-group dynamics. The high standard deviations indicate this is a key point of variation in the corpus.

*   **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy:** This pair shows a clear lean towards the virtue. **Pragmatism** (M=0.51) is substantially more prevalent than **Fantasy** (M=0.31). This reinforces the finding from the Truth/Manipulation axis that the discourse is strategically grounded in appeals to realism and practicality over escapist or conspiratorial narratives.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

**Salience vs. Raw Scores:** Across most dimensions, the mean salience score is slightly higher than the mean raw score. This is particularly true for Truth (Raw=0.65, Salience=0.71) and Resentment (Raw=0.68, Salience=0.70). This pattern suggests that when these rhetorical features are present, they are also used as prominent, central elements of the argument, rather than as peripheral remarks. The one exception is Pragmatism (Raw=0.51, Salience=0.48), suggesting that while pragmatic arguments are present, they may not always be the main thrust of the communication.

**Confidence-Weighted Analysis:** The consistently high confidence scores (all means > 0.87) are a significant finding. The model was most confident in its classifications of **Tribalism** (M=0.95) and **Resentment** (M=0.94), and least (though still highly) confident in **Hope** (M=0.88) and **Truth** (M=0.88). This high overall confidence strengthens the validity of the descriptive findings, as it indicates the model found clear and unambiguous signals for each dimension. It suggests the rhetorical strategies, though complex, were not subtle or difficult to detect.

### 5.3 Inferred Relationships and Need for Correlational Analysis

A full correlation and interaction analysis is impossible without the underlying document-level scores or a correlation matrix. However, based on the framework's oppositional design and the descriptive statistics, we can infer potential relationships and highlight the necessity of future correlational studies.

The CAF's validity rests on the assumption that its virtue-vice pairs are negatively correlated. The mean scores provide circumstantial evidence that this may be the case:
*   The large gap between **Truth (0.65)** and **Manipulation (0.35)** strongly suggests a negative relationship.
*   Similarly, the gap between **Pragmatism (0.51)** and **Fantasy (0.31)** points to an inverse relationship.

The other pairs are less clear. The proximity of **Justice (0.64)** and **Resentment (0.68)**, and **Dignity (0.58)** and **Tribalism (0.51)**, suggests that these concepts may not be mutually exclusive in this corpus. It is plausible that some documents score high on *both* dimensions, for example, by framing a tribalistic or resentful cause in the language of justice. This would represent a sophisticated rhetorical strategy of "virtue-washing" a vice. A correlational analysis is essential to explore this possibility. A weak or even positive correlation between a supposed virtue-vice pair would be a critical finding, suggesting either a flaw in the framework's operationalization or a highly complex rhetorical environment where these concepts are strategically blended.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The strongest statistical pattern is the co-occurrence of high scores for **Resentment, Justice, and Truth**. This triad forms the rhetorical core of the analyzed corpus. This pattern suggests a meta-strategy of **"Vindictive Veritas"**—a narrative that claims a monopoly on truth to fuel a campaign against perceived injustices. This aligns with political communication theories that describe populist rhetoric, which often combines anti-elite resentment with claims to represent the "true" will and reality of the people.

The secondary pattern is the tension between **Hope (0.60)** and **Fear (0.48)**. This is a classic rhetorical dyad used to create a sense of urgency and high stakes. The discourse simultaneously offers a "heaven" to be gained and a "hell" to be avoided, motivating action through both aspiration and anxiety.

The relative weakness of **Fantasy (0.31)** and **Manipulation (0.35)** is also theoretically significant. It suggests the speakers are aware of the need to maintain a veneer of credibility and realism. The strategy is not to invent realities wholesale (Fantasy) or to use obvious deception (Manipulation), but rather to frame existing realities through a powerful emotional lens of Resentment and Justice. This is a more subtle and potentially more effective strategy for persuasion in a skeptical environment.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this limited analysis, the CAF demonstrates both promise and areas needing further validation.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework appears to have strong discriminatory power. The mean scores for the dimensions vary widely (from 0.31 for Fantasy to 0.68 for Resentment), and the standard deviations are substantial, indicating the framework is sensitive to variations in the corpus. It is not simply assigning average scores to everything.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The framework seems to fit the corpus well, as all ten dimensions were detected. The high confidence scores suggest the phenomena described by the CAF are present and measurable in the source texts.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The most crucial insight is the need to test the oppositional assumption. The data from the Justice/Resentment and Dignity/Tribalism pairs suggests that political rhetoric may be more complex than a simple zero-sum trade-off between virtue and vice. Speakers may be adept at fusing them. The CAF is effective in highlighting this potential complexity, which is a strength. However, it requires a more robust dataset to confirm whether this fusion is a genuine rhetorical strategy or an artifact of the small sample.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications

The findings from this analysis, though preliminary, have significant theoretical implications for the study of civic discourse. The dominant rhetorical profile of "aggrieved righteousness" (high Resentment, Justice, and Truth) challenges a simplistic view of political communication as a binary choice between virtuous deliberation and vicious propaganda. Instead, it reveals a hybrid strategy where the virtuous language of justice and truth is instrumentalized to serve the potentially corrosive emotion of resentment.

From a civic republican perspective, this is a deeply concerning pattern. While appeals to justice are virtuous, theory suggests that when decoupled from dignity and fused with resentment and tribalism, they can undermine the very foundation of a republic: civic trust and a commitment to the common good. Resentment-fueled justice can easily curdle into factionalism and retribution, eroding the norms of reciprocity and mutual respect. The near-parity of Dignity (0.58) and Tribalism (0.51) scores is the statistical fingerprint of this very tension.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

While the small N precludes definitive archetyping, the aggregate data paints a picture of a specific rhetorical archetype: the **Righteous Tribune**. This speaker positions themselves not as a pragmatic manager but as a moral crusader. They speak "truth" to a corrupt system, channel the "resentment" of the wronged, and promise "justice" as the ultimate outcome. They motivate followers with a combination of "hope" for a restored future and "fear" of the enemy. This archetype is less concerned with consensus-building (which would require higher Dignity and lower Tribalism) and more focused on mobilization. This analysis provides a quantitative blueprint for this common political persona.

### Broader Significance

This research demonstrates the power of computational methods like the CAF to move beyond anecdotal readings of political texts and provide systematic, replicable measurements of their underlying moral and ethical character. By quantifying concepts like "hope," "truth," and "resentment," we can begin to analyze the health of our public sphere with the same rigor we apply to economic or social trends. If these findings were replicated on a larger scale, they would suggest a political environment where the language of virtue is being used to amplify civic division, a critical insight for scholars, journalists, and citizens alike.

### Limitations and Future Directions

The limitations of this study are significant and point directly to avenues for future research.
1.  **Scale Up the Analysis:** The most critical next step is to apply the CAF to a large, diverse corpus of political texts. This would allow for generalization and the use of inferential statistics.
2.  **Conduct Correlational Analysis:** With a larger dataset, a full correlational and factor analysis should be conducted to test the framework's oppositional structure and explore the relationships between dimensions. This is essential for validating the CAF as a measurement tool.
3.  **Integrate Qualitative Evidence:** Future analyses must link quantitative scores back to specific textual examples. This qualitative grounding is essential for validating the model's classifications and understanding the nuanced ways in which these rhetorical strategies are deployed in practice.
4.  **Temporal and Comparative Studies:** The framework should be used to track the evolution of political discourse over time or to compare different speakers, parties, or media ecosystems. This would allow researchers to identify trends and diagnose shifts in the character of civic communication.

## 7. Conclusion

This report detailed an exploratory analysis of political discourse using the Civic Analysis Framework v10.0. The quantitative results, derived from a small sample of eight documents, revealed a coherent and potent rhetorical strategy centered on **aggrieved righteousness**, where appeals to **Truth** and **Justice** are interwoven with high levels of **Resentment**. This core narrative is supported by emotional appeals to both **Hope** and **Fear**, and grounded in a veneer of **Pragmatism**.

Methodologically, the analysis confirmed the CAF's potential as a sensitive instrument for deconstructing political rhetoric, evidenced by the high confidence scores and its ability to detect a complex, multi-faceted communication style. However, the study's primary contributions are in its clear articulation of the current analytical limitations—namely the small sample size and lack of correlational and qualitative data—and the specific, testable hypotheses it generates for future research.

Ultimately, this analysis serves as a proof of concept. It demonstrates that the deep-seated virtues and vices that animate our political life are not beyond the reach of systematic, computational analysis. By refining and scaling this approach, we can develop a more profound and empirically grounded understanding of the health and character of our democracy.
