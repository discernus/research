The speaker employs a strong moral and fact-based argument, focusing on systemic injustice and the potential for redemptive, bipartisan reform. The rhetoric is characterized by high levels of Justice, Dignity, and Hope, contrasted with a strong critique (Resentment) of the existing system's failures. The approach is explicitly pragmatic, framing the bill as an important but incomplete 'first step'. Vice dimensions like Tribalism, Manipulation, and Fantasy are notably absent.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"cory_booker_2018_first_step_act_0c32812a.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribalism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"manipulation\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"truth\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"resentment\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"justice\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 1.0,\n          \"salience\": 1.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.2,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"fantasy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"pragmatism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribalism\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us.
