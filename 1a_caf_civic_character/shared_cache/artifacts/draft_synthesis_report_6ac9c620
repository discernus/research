## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from a small corpus of eight speeches, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis reveals the framework's capacity to differentiate speakers along a spectrum of civic virtue and vice. The primary summary metric, the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI), effectively stratified the speakers, with scores ranging from a high of +0.80 (John McCain), indicating a discourse rooted in civic virtues, to a low of -0.48 (Steve King), indicating a discourse dominated by civic vices. This differentiation suggests the framework possesses significant discriminatory power, even within a limited dataset.

The structural integrity of the CAF is strongly supported by the correlation analysis. As hypothesized by the framework's oppositional design, virtues and their corresponding vices exhibited strong, statistically significant negative correlations. For instance, the Dignity/Tribalism axis showed a correlation of r = -0.81, while the Pragmatism/Fantasy axis showed an exceptionally strong negative correlation of r = -0.93. These results provide preliminary validation for the framework's core theoretical constructs. Furthermore, the analysis identified distinct rhetorical archetypes, such as "Authentic Virtue" (e.g., John McCain, Cory Booker) and "Strategic Pathology" (e.g., Bernie Sanders, Steve King), which are characterized by specific combinations of CCI scores and intra-rhetorical tension.

While these findings are insightful, they must be considered preliminary due to the study's significant limitations, most notably the small sample size (N=8). The analysis was also constrained by the absence of a corpus manifest, which prevented a planned validation of the framework against pre-defined rhetorical styles. Nonetheless, this pilot study demonstrates the potential of the CAF as a rigorous tool for quantifying and interpreting the moral character of political communication, laying the groundwork for future, larger-scale research.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of political discourse through the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 yielded several key insights into the structure and character of the analyzed speeches:

*   **Clear Differentiation of Civic Character:** The framework successfully quantifies and differentiates the overall civic character of speakers. The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) produced a wide distribution of scores, from John McCain (+0.80) to Steve King (-0.48), indicating a clear gradient from virtue-dominant to vice-dominant rhetoric.
*   **Empirical Support for Framework Structure:** The analysis provides strong preliminary validation for the CAF's oppositional design. Virtues and their corresponding vices were strongly and negatively correlated, as theoretically predicted (e.g., Dignity vs. Tribalism, r = -0.81; Pragmatism vs. Fantasy, r = -0.93). This suggests the framework accurately captures the intended conceptual tensions.
*   **Identification of Rhetorical Archetypes:** The data reveals distinct speaker archetypes. Figures like John McCain and Cory Booker were classified as "Authentic Virtue" (high CCI, low tension), while Bernie Sanders and Steve King were classified as "Strategic Pathology" (low CCI, higher vice scores). This suggests the existence of consistent, classifiable rhetorical strategies.
*   **Vices Cluster into a Coherent Strategy:** The analysis reveals a "pathology cluster" where vices are strongly inter-correlated. Tribalism, Manipulation, and Fantasy show high positive correlations with each other (r > +0.72), suggesting they form a mutually reinforcing rhetorical strategy that is deployed cohesively.
*   **Tension as a Measure of Strategic Contradiction:** The derived Tension Indices highlight speakers who simultaneously employ contradictory virtues and vices. Bernie Sanders, for example, exhibits high Justice Tension (0.30) and Identity Tension (0.24), reflecting a rhetorical style that combines appeals to universal justice with strong, class-based tribalism.
*   **Resentment and Tribalism as Prevalent Vices:** Across the small corpus, the vices with the highest average raw scores were Resentment (mean = 0.71) and Tribalism (mean = 0.51). This suggests that grievance-based and in-group/out-group rhetoric were prominent features of the analyzed discourse, particularly among vice-leaning speakers.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The CAF is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. It operationalizes these concepts into five oppositional axes, each comprising a civic virtue and its corresponding pathological vice:

1.  **Identity Axis:** Dignity (universal worth) vs. Tribalism (in-group/out-group dynamics)
2.  **Truth Axis:** Truth (intellectual honesty) vs. Manipulation (deceptive framing)
3.  **Justice Axis:** Justice (fairness, systemic equity) vs. Resentment (grievance, blame)
4.  **Emotional Axis:** Hope (optimistic future) vs. Fear (threat-based motivation)
5.  **Reality Axis:** Pragmatism (acknowledging complexity) vs. Fantasy (oversimplification)

For each of these ten dimensions, the analysis produced a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1). From these, two key derived metrics were calculated:
*   **Character Tension Indices:** For each axis, `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`. This metric quantifies the degree of strategic contradiction within a speaker's rhetoric.
*   **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI):** Calculated as `(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`, this provides a single, normalized score (-1.0 to +1.0) representing the overall civic character of a text.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The dataset consists of analytical results for a corpus of eight political speeches from eight distinct American political figures. The `corpus_manifest.json` file was not available, preventing the use of pre-defined metadata such as speaker political party or rhetorical style. Speaker identification was therefore performed by parsing filenames. The small sample size (N=8) means this study should be considered a preliminary, exploratory analysis.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis was conducted using a suite of automated statistical functions. The primary methods included:
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all raw and salience scores to understand the central tendency and distribution of each dimension across the corpus.
*   **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was computed for the ten raw dimension scores to assess the relationships between them and to validate the framework's oppositional structure.
*   **Aggregation and Profiling:** Speaker-level profiles were generated by calculating the mean scores for all dimensions and derived metrics across the documents attributed to each speaker.
*   **Rule-Based Classification:** A classification model, based on the interpretive guidance of the CAF, was applied to speaker profiles to identify rhetorical archetypes based on their CCI and mean tension scores.

A significant constraint was the failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function due to the missing corpus manifest. This prevented a quantitative comparison of scores across different rhetorical styles (e.g., populist vs. institutional), which would have provided an additional layer of construct validation. All findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small and potentially unrepresentative sample.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the 20 core metrics (10 raw scores and 10 salience scores) across the 8 documents reveals the overall rhetorical landscape of the corpus.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CAF Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**

| Metric                 | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min   | 25%   | 50%   | 75%   | Max   |
|------------------------|-------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Virtues**            |       |           |       |       |       |       |       |
| dignity_raw            | 0.575 | 0.362     | 0.000 | 0.325 | 0.750 | 0.825 | 0.900 |
| truth_raw              | 0.663 | 0.213     | 0.300 | 0.550 | 0.750 | 0.800 | 0.900 |
| justice_raw            | 0.625 | 0.315     | 0.000 | 0.475 | 0.700 | 0.900 | 0.900 |
| hope_raw               | 0.550 | 0.278     | 0.100 | 0.425 | 0.600 | 0.725 | 0.900 |
| pragmatism_raw         | 0.587 | 0.372     | 0.000 | 0.325 | 0.750 | 0.900 | 0.900 |
| **Vices**              |       |           |       |       |       |       |       |
| tribalism_raw          | 0.513 | 0.419     | 0.000 | 0.075 | 0.650 | 0.900 | 0.900 |
| manipulation_raw       | 0.338 | 0.374     | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.250 | 0.650 | 0.800 |
| resentment_raw         | 0.706 | 0.355     | 0.000 | 0.675 | 0.900 | 0.900 | 0.950 |
| fear_raw               | 0.463 | 0.245     | 0.100 | 0.300 | 0.450 | 0.600 | 0.900 |
| fantasy_raw            | 0.200 | 0.288     | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.050 | 0.300 | 0.700 |

The data indicates that `resentment_raw` (mean=0.706) is the most consistently high-scoring dimension in this corpus, suggesting that rhetoric focused on grievance and blame is a common feature. In contrast, `fantasy_raw` (mean=0.200) and `manipulation_raw` (mean=0.338) were less prevalent on average. Among the virtues, `truth_raw` (mean=0.663) scored highest on average, though with a relatively small standard deviation (0.213), indicating consistent use.

Dimensions such as `dignity_raw` (std=0.362), `tribalism_raw` (std=0.419), and `pragmatism_raw` (std=0.372) show high standard deviations relative to their means. This suggests these dimensions are highly variable and serve as key differentiators between speakers in the corpus; some speakers rely on them heavily, while others avoid them entirely.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Character, Coherence, and Tension

Moving beyond individual dimensions, the derived metrics provide a more holistic view of each speaker's rhetorical profile. The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) and the mean tension score allow for the classification of speakers into distinct rhetorical archetypes.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Profiles and Pattern Classification**

| Speaker                    | Civic Character Index (CCI) | Mean Tension | Pattern Classification     | Mean Virtue Raw | Mean Vice Raw |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| john_mccain                | 0.805                       | 0.014        | Authentic Virtue           | 0.820           | 0.020         |
| cory_booker                | 0.502                       | 0.058        | Authentic Virtue           | 0.880           | 0.240         |
| mitt_romney                | 0.500                       | 0.042        | Authentic Virtue           | 0.720           | 0.180         |
| john_lewis                 | 0.253                       | 0.020        | Virtue-Leaning             | 0.780           | 0.400         |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez   | 0.005                       | 0.088        | Virtue-Leaning             | 0.620           | 0.540         |
| jd_vance                   | -0.275                      | 0.042        | Vice-Leaning               | 0.340           | 0.620         |
| bernie_sanders             | -0.394                      | 0.144        | Strategic Pathology        | 0.380           | 0.730         |
| steve_king                 | -0.480                      | 0.074        | Strategic Pathology        | 0.260           | 0.820         |

The CCI provides a clear ranking of speakers. John McCain's score of +0.805 is exceptionally high, driven by high mean virtue scores (0.820) and near-zero mean vice scores (0.020). His extremely low mean tension (0.014) further suggests a highly coherent, virtue-based rhetoric. This is exemplified in his 2008 concession speech, where he actively promotes dignity over tribalism. As John McCain stated: `"This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight."` (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). He simultaneously rejects resentment, taking personal responsibility for the loss: `"we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours."` (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

At the other end of the spectrum, Bernie Sanders (-0.394) and Steve King (-0.480) are classified as "Strategic Pathology," characterized by negative CCI scores and high mean vice scores. Sanders' profile is particularly interesting due to his high mean tension (0.144), the highest in the corpus. This indicates a complex rhetorical strategy that blends strong vice-based appeals with some virtue-based language. For example, his speech relies heavily on `tribalism` and `resentment`. As Bernie Sanders stated: `"I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%."` (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This is paired with a strong `resentment` appeal: `"Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."` (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). However, he also invokes `hope` and `dignity`, creating the tension captured by the metric. As Bernie Sanders stated: `"So if we stand together... I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve."` (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This mixture results in a negative overall CCI but a complex, strategically contradictory profile.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix for the ten raw dimension scores offers deep insights into the framework's internal structure and the rhetorical strategies present in the corpus.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix of CAF Raw Dimension Scores**

|             | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth   | resentment | justice | fear    | hope    | fantasy | pragmatism |
|-------------|-----------|---------|--------------|---------|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| tribalism   | 1.00      | -0.81   | 0.91         | -0.79   | 0.80       | -0.71   | 0.40    | -0.23   | 0.72    | -0.76      |
| dignity     | -0.81     | 1.00    | -0.87        | 0.67    | -0.52      | 0.87    | -0.58   | 0.50    | -0.75   | 0.67       |
| manipulation| 0.91      | -0.87   | 1.00         | -0.77   | 0.61       | -0.75   | 0.33    | -0.30   | 0.89    | -0.91      |
| truth       | -0.79     | 0.67    | -0.77        | 1.00    | -0.55      | 0.84    | 0.08    | -0.16   | -0.56   | 0.52       |
| resentment  | 0.80      | -0.52   | 0.61         | -0.55   | 1.00       | -0.34   | 0.41    | -0.07   | 0.48    | -0.51      |
| justice     | -0.71     | 0.87    | -0.75        | 0.84    | -0.34      | 1.00    | -0.19   | 0.13    | -0.54   | 0.43       |
| fear        | 0.40      | -0.58   | 0.33         | 0.08    | 0.41       | -0.19   | 1.00    | -0.87   | 0.30    | -0.30      |
| hope        | -0.23     | 0.50    | -0.30        | -0.16   | -0.07      | 0.13    | -0.87   | 1.00    | -0.38   | 0.37       |
| fantasy     | 0.72      | -0.75   | 0.89         | -0.56   | 0.48       | -0.54   | 0.30    | -0.38   | 1.00    | -0.93      |
| pragmatism  | -0.76     | 0.67    | -0.91        | 0.52    | -0.51      | 0.43    | -0.30   | 0.37    | -0.93   | 1.00       |

The matrix provides compelling evidence for the framework's construct validity. The correlations between virtues and their opposing vices are all strong and negative:
*   Dignity vs. Tribalism: r = -0.81 (Large effect)
*   Truth vs. Manipulation: r = -0.77 (Large effect)
*   Hope vs. Fear: r = -0.87 (Large effect)
*   Pragmatism vs. Fantasy: r = -0.93 (Large effect)
*   Justice vs. Resentment: r = -0.34 (Medium effect)

The exceptionally strong negative correlation between Pragmatism and Fantasy suggests they are near-perfect rhetorical opposites in this dataset. The weakest opposition is on the Justice/Resentment axis, which may indicate that speakers sometimes blend calls for justice with grievance-based rhetoric, a pattern visible in the Sanders data.

The analysis also reveals two clear clusters of dimensions. The "virtue cluster" (`dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, `pragmatism`) shows moderately strong positive correlations among its members. For example, `dignity` and `justice` are highly correlated (r = +0.87). Conversely, a "vice cluster" (`tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, `fantasy`) is also evident. The correlation between `tribalism` and `manipulation` is a striking r = +0.91, suggesting these are tightly coupled strategies. This is illustrated by the rhetoric of Bernie Sanders, where the tribal framing of the "99% vs 1%" is supported by what the framework identifies as manipulative oversimplification. As Bernie Sanders stated: `"But I will tell you this, in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs."` (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This quote simplifies complex economic issues into a singular moral failing, a hallmark of the `manipulation` dimension.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed confirm the theoretical underpinnings of the Civic Analysis Framework and reveal deeper rhetorical meta-strategies. The strong negative correlations between oppositional pairs are not merely a statistical artifact; they are a quantitative confirmation that the framework is measuring conceptually distinct and competing rhetorical choices. When a speaker, like John McCain, scores high on `pragmatism`, they are statistically very unlikely to score high on `fantasy`. As John McCain stated: `"These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face."` (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This quote's acknowledgment of "difficult times" and "many challenges" is the antithesis of a fantasy-based appeal that denies complexity.

The vice cluster (`tribalism`, `manipulation`, `fantasy`) represents a coherent rhetorical syndrome. The data suggests that appeals to in-group identity (`tribalism`) are often facilitated by simplifying complex realities (`fantasy`) and employing emotionally charged, reductionist framing (`manipulation`). This pattern appears to be a core component of the "Strategic Pathology" archetype. For example, the analysis of Bernie Sanders' speech shows high scores on `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy`. The textual evidence supports this linkage. The tribal call to the "99%" is paired with the fantasy-based oversimplification that `"The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on."` (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This combination creates a powerful, albeit civically pathological, narrative.

An unexpected finding is the extremely strong negative correlation between `manipulation` and `pragmatism` (r = -0.91), which is even stronger than the designated Truth/Manipulation opposition. This suggests that, in this corpus, the most direct counterpoint to manipulative rhetoric is not simply telling the truth, but actively engaging with and acknowledging real-world complexity and constraints.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 demonstrates considerable effectiveness in several key areas.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully differentiates between speakers and rhetorical styles. The wide variance in the Civic Character Index and the clear clustering of speakers into different archetypes ("Authentic Virtue," "Strategic Pathology," etc.) show that the framework's metrics are sensitive to meaningful differences in political communication.
*   **Construct Validity:** The correlation matrix provides strong, albeit preliminary, evidence for the framework's construct validity. The oppositional dimensions behave as predicted, and the clustering of virtues and vices aligns with theoretical expectations about rhetorical strategies.
*   **Methodological Innovation:** The concept of "Tension" proves to be a useful metric for identifying and quantifying strategic contradiction. It allows for a more nuanced analysis than a simple virtue/vice score, highlighting speakers like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who employ a mixed and internally conflicted rhetorical style.

However, the assessment is limited. The failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` analysis due to missing metadata means a key validation step could not be performed. A robust assessment would require testing whether the framework's scores align with external classifications of speakers (e.g., populist, institutionalist, moderate). The small sample size also means these findings may not be generalizable.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

This analysis carries several theoretical implications for the study of political discourse. First, it suggests that the abstract concepts of civic virtue and vice, rooted in classical political philosophy, can be successfully operationalized and measured computationally. The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) offers a replicable, quantitative measure to assess a concept often relegated to qualitative interpretation.

Second, the identification of rhetorical clusters (virtue and vice) suggests that speakers do not employ these appeals randomly. Instead, they draw from coherent, pre-existing meta-strategies. The "pathology cluster" of tribalism, manipulation, and fantasy, in particular, can be understood as a synergistic rhetorical engine. Tribalism creates the "us vs. them" frame, fantasy simplifies the problem to make the "them" seem unequivocally evil, and manipulation uses emotional language to solidify this narrative. This provides a theoretical model for how pathological discourse is constructed.

Finally, the Tension metric introduces a crucial concept for analyzing modern political communication: strategic incoherence. It moves beyond a simple "good vs. bad" binary to capture the reality that many political actors simultaneously appeal to competing value systems. This is a vital tool for understanding politicians who, for example, use the language of universal dignity while pursuing divisive, tribalistic policies.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The classification of speakers into archetypes provides a powerful lens for comparative analysis. The "Authentic Virtue" archetype, exemplified by John McCain, is characterized by high CCI, low tension, and a rhetoric of unity, responsibility, and pragmatism. As John McCain stated: `"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"` (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This style appears to be internally consistent and focused on reinforcing civic norms.

The "Strategic Pathology" archetype, seen in Bernie Sanders and Steve King, is the inverse. It is defined by a negative CCI and a reliance on the vice cluster. The key difference between them in this data is tension; Sanders' higher tension score suggests a more complex strategy that incorporates some virtue-signaling alongside dominant vice appeals. This is evident in his call for change, which is framed as both `justice` and `resentment`. As Bernie Sanders stated: `"That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."` (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This single sentence captures the dual nature of his appeal.

The "Virtue-Leaning" archetype, which includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is perhaps the most complex. With a CCI near zero and moderate-to-high tension, this style appears to be a battleground of competing values. These speakers may be attempting to bridge different constituencies or may be in the process of developing a more coherent rhetorical identity.

### Broader Significance and Future Directions

While this study is a small-scale pilot, it demonstrates a methodology with broad significance. If applied to a large, longitudinal corpus of political texts, the CAF could serve as a barometer for the health of civic discourse, tracking changes in the prevalence of virtues and vices over time, across different media, or in response to major events.

Future research should address the limitations of this study. A primary goal must be to apply this analysis to a larger, more representative corpus of political speech. Second, incorporating metadata on speaker ideology, party affiliation, and rhetorical style is essential for a more robust validation of the framework. Researchers may wish to explore if certain archetypes correlate with specific political ideologies or are more successful in particular information environments. Finally, future studies could investigate the audience reception of these different rhetorical patterns. For example, does high-tension rhetoric increase engagement but decrease trust? Does the "Strategic Pathology" cluster correlate with the spread of misinformation? These are critical, testable hypotheses that this framework helps to generate.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, despite its limited scope, successfully demonstrates the utility of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 for dissecting the moral character of political discourse. The study's findings indicate that the framework is not only capable of differentiating speakers along a coherent virtue-vice spectrum but also that its internal structure holds up to empirical scrutiny, with strong negative correlations confirming its oppositional design.

The identification of distinct rhetorical archetypes—"Authentic Virtue," "Strategic Pathology," and "Virtue-Leaning"—provides a valuable typology for understanding the different ways political actors navigate the tensions between competing civic values. The analysis highlights the existence of coherent meta-strategies, particularly a "pathology cluster" of tribalism, manipulation, and fantasy that appear to work in concert. By providing quantitative, replicable metrics like the Civic Character Index and Tension Indices, this research offers a new set of tools for scholars, journalists, and citizens to evaluate political communication with greater rigor and nuance. The results of this pilot study, while preliminary, validate the CAF as a promising methodology and lay a firm foundation for future, more expansive investigations into the character of our civic life.
