# Civic Analysis Framework Analysis Report

**Framework**: CAF v10.0
**Corpus**: Not available (8 documents)  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from a corpus of eight speeches by prominent American political figures. Using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, this study evaluates the rhetorical choices of speakers across five oppositional axes of virtue and vice: Dignity vs. Tribalism, Truth vs. Manipulation, Justice vs. Resentment, Hope vs. Fear, and Pragmatism vs. Fantasy. The analysis leverages a suite of statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and the calculation of derived metrics, to map the moral landscape of the provided corpus. Due to the pilot nature of this study and its small sample size (N=8), all findings should be considered preliminary and indicative of patterns that warrant further investigation with larger datasets.

The analysis reveals significant and interpretable patterns in rhetorical strategy. The primary finding is the successful differentiation of speakers into distinct rhetorical archetypes based on their civic character profiles. The **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, a composite score ranging from -1.0 (vice-dominant) to +1.0 (virtue-dominant), effectively ranked speakers from John McCain (CCI = +0.80) to Steve King (CCI = -0.48). This quantitative ranking is supported by a qualitative classification, identifying speakers like McCain as exhibiting "Authentic Virtue" and others, such as Bernie Sanders and Steve King, as employing "Strategic Pathology." Furthermore, the analysis of **Character Tension Indices** uncovers nuanced strategies where speakers simultaneously appeal to competing values, a pattern particularly notable in speakers with CCI scores near zero, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

The study also serves as a preliminary validation of the CAF v10.0's construct validity. The correlation matrix of the ten core dimensions demonstrates strong, statistically significant negative relationships between the framework's defined virtues and their corresponding vices (e.g., Pragmatism vs. Fantasy, r = -0.93). This indicates that the framework's theoretical oppositions are reflected in the empirical data. The analysis identified two primary rhetorical meta-strategies: a "virtue cluster" (Dignity, Justice, Truth) and a "vice cluster" (Tribalism, Manipulation, Resentment), which speakers tend to employ cohesively. These preliminary findings suggest that the CAF is a promising tool for the systematic, scalable, and nuanced analysis of civic character in political communication, though broader conclusions depend on future research with more extensive and varied corpora.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of political discourse through the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 yielded several key insights into the structure and character of civic rhetoric. The following points represent the most significant preliminary findings from the dataset:

*   **Distinct Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge:** The analysis successfully identified and classified speakers into coherent rhetorical archetypes. For instance, John McCain's profile (CCI = +0.80, Mean Tension = 0.01) aligns with the "Authentic Virtue" classification, while Steve King's (CCI = -0.48, Mean Tension = 0.07) and Bernie Sanders' (CCI = -0.39, Mean Tension = 0.14) profiles are classified as "Strategic Pathology." This suggests the framework can differentiate between fundamentally different rhetorical postures.
*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) Provides a Robust Summary Metric:** The CCI effectively quantifies the overall civic orientation of a speaker's discourse. The wide distribution of scores, from highly positive (John McCain, +0.80) to highly negative (Steve King, -0.48), indicates the metric's strong discriminatory power within this sample.
*   **Framework Construct Validity is Supported by Correlation Patterns:** The analysis provides strong preliminary support for the CAF's theoretical design. Virtues are negatively correlated with their opposing vices, as hypothesized. The strongest oppositional relationship was between Pragmatism and Fantasy (r = -0.93), and the Identity axis also showed a very strong negative correlation between Dignity and Tribalism (r = -0.81).
*   **Rhetorical Vices and Virtues Cluster into Meta-Strategies:** The data reveals two dominant, opposing rhetorical syndromes. Vices such as Tribalism, Manipulation, and Resentment are strongly inter-correlated, forming a cohesive "pathology" cluster. Conversely, virtues like Dignity, Justice, and Truth form a "civic" cluster. This suggests speakers often draw from a consistent palette of related virtues or vices rather than mixing them randomly.
*   **Tension Indices Reveal Strategic Contradictions:** The analysis of tension metrics highlights speakers who strategically combine virtuous and pathological appeals. Bernie Sanders, for example, exhibits high tension on the Justice/Resentment axis (0.30) and the Identity axis (0.24). This is reflected in his rhetoric, where he simultaneously invokes principles of fairness while employing strong, grievance-based framing. As Bernie Sanders stated: "Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This quote captures both the appeal to `justice` (changing a rigged system) and the intense `resentment` (focus on a grievance).
*   **The Hope/Fear Axis Functions as a Primary Emotional Modulator:** The emotional axis of Hope vs. Fear shows a powerful inverse relationship (r = -0.87). This axis appears to function as a key emotional driver that can be paired with either virtuous or pathological content, suggesting its central role in setting the affective tone of a speech.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The framework is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory, focusing on the moral character speakers demonstrate through their rhetoric. It operates on five fundamental, oppositional axes, each comprising a civic virtue and its corresponding vice:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `Dignity` (appeals to universal human worth) vs. `Tribalism` (appeals to in-group/out-group dynamics).
2.  **Truth Axis:** `Truth` (appeals based on verifiable facts and intellectual honesty) vs. `Manipulation` (appeals based on deception and emotional exploitation).
3.  **Justice Axis:** `Justice` (appeals to fairness, rights, and due process) vs. `Resentment` (appeals based on grievance, envy, and blame).
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `Hope` (appeals to a positive, achievable future) vs. `Fear` (appeals based on threat and anxiety).
5.  **Reality Axis:** `Pragmatism` (appeals acknowledging complexity and trade-offs) vs. `Fantasy` (appeals based on simplistic, unrealistic solutions).

For each of these ten dimensions, the analysis produced a `raw` score (intensity) and a `salience` score (emphasis). From these, two key derived metrics were calculated: the **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, which provides a single, normalized measure of a speaker's overall orientation towards virtue or vice, and five **Character Tension Indices**, which measure the degree of strategic contradiction when a speaker uses a virtue and its opposing vice simultaneously.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The corpus for this analysis consists of eight distinct political speeches from eight different American political figures, spanning a range of ideological positions and rhetorical contexts. The speakers include John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, John Lewis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King.

The input data for each document included raw and salience scores (from 0 to 1) for the ten CAF dimensions, along with a confidence score for each measurement. The analysis pipeline first calculated the derived CCI and Tension metrics for each document and then aggregated these scores at the speaker level to generate individual character profiles.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis proceeded in several stages. First, **descriptive statistics** (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) were computed for all raw and salience scores to provide a baseline understanding of the data distribution. Second, a **Pearson correlation matrix** was generated for the ten raw dimension scores to examine the interrelationships between rhetorical concepts and to assess the framework's construct validity. Third, speaker-level profiles were generated by averaging scores across documents for each speaker. Finally, a **rule-based classification** system, derived from the framework's interpretive guidance, was applied to categorize each speaker's dominant rhetorical pattern (e.g., "Authentic Virtue," "Strategic Pathology").

### Limitations and Methodological Choices

The primary limitation of this study is its **small sample size (N=8)**. With only one speech per speaker, the findings cannot be generalized to the speakers' entire rhetorical careers or to broader political discourse. All conclusions must be interpreted as **preliminary and exploratory**, highlighting potential patterns that require validation with a much larger and more diverse corpus.

A second limitation arose from the available metadata. The corpus manifest was not available, preventing analysis based on pre-defined categories like rhetorical style. An attempt to validate the framework by comparing scores across styles (`validate_framework_by_style`) failed for this reason, a result that is explicitly noted in the findings. Speaker identification was performed via a fallback method of parsing filenames, which, while effective for this dataset, is not a robust solution for larger-scale analyses. Finally, the available textual evidence was limited, providing strong examples for some speakers (McCain, Sanders) but not for all, constraining the ability to provide qualitative support for every statistical claim.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial descriptive analysis of the 20 primary metrics (10 raw scores and 10 salience scores) across all 8 documents reveals the general tendencies within the corpus. The vices of `Resentment` (mean raw = 0.71) and `Tribalism` (mean raw = 0.51) were, on average, the most intensely used pathological dimensions. Among the virtues, `Truth` (mean raw = 0.66) and `Justice` (mean raw = 0.63) were the most prominent. The least utilized dimension was `Fantasy` (mean raw = 0.20). The standard deviations indicate that scores for `Tribalism` (std = 0.42) and `Dignity` (std = 0.36) showed high variability, suggesting that the choice to employ these identity-based frames differs substantially among speakers in this corpus.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics of CAF Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**

| Statistic | tribalism_raw | dignity_raw | manipulation_raw | truth_raw | resentment_raw | justice_raw | fear_raw | hope_raw | fantasy_raw | pragmatism_raw |

*(Note: Salience score statistics show similar patterns and are omitted for brevity.)*

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a more synthesized view of civic character. The **Civic Character Index (CCI)** offers a clear ranking of speakers. The analysis also classifies each speaker into a rhetorical archetype based on their combination of CCI, mean virtue/vice scores, and mean tension.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Profiles and Pattern Classification**

| Speaker | Civic Character Index (CCI) | Mean Tension | Pattern Classification | Mean Virtue Raw | Mean Vice Raw |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| john_mccain | 0.805 | 0.014 | Authentic Virtue | 0.82 | 0.02 |
| cory_booker | 0.502 | 0.058 | Authentic Virtue | 0.88 | 0.24 |
| mitt_romney | 0.500 | 0.042 | Authentic Virtue | 0.72 | 0.18 |
| john_lewis | 0.253 | 0.020 | Virtue-Leaning | 0.78 | 0.40 |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez | 0.005 | 0.088 | Virtue-Leaning | 0.62 | 0.54 |
| jd_vance | -0.275 | 0.042 | Vice-Leaning | 0.34 | 0.62 |
| bernie_sanders | -0.394 | 0.144 | Strategic Pathology | 0.38 | 0.73 |
| steve_king | -0.480 | 0.074 | Strategic Pathology | 0.26 | 0.82 |

John McCain's 2008 concession speech emerges as the exemplar of "Authentic Virtue," with the highest CCI (+0.805) and the lowest mean tension (0.014). His profile is characterized by high mean virtue scores (0.82) and exceptionally low mean vice scores (0.02). This statistical profile is supported by the textual evidence. As John McCain stated: "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This quote is a clear instance of the `dignity` dimension, directly contributing to his high virtue score. His rejection of blame, stating "we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), exemplifies the absence of `resentment` that drives his CCI score up.

In stark contrast, Bernie Sanders and Steve King are classified as "Strategic Pathology." Sanders' profile (CCI = -0.394) is particularly interesting due to its high mean tension (0.144), the highest in the corpus. This indicates a strategy that heavily employs vices while simultaneously making appeals to virtue. His high mean vice score (0.73) is driven by strong use of `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `resentment`. For example, his statement, "I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), is a classic `tribalism` appeal. This is combined with high-intensity `resentment`, as seen when he claims, "The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), which the framework also flags as `fantasy` for its oversimplification. The high tension score reflects his attempt to frame this pathological narrative as a fight for `justice`.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix for the ten raw dimension scores provides critical insight into the framework's internal structure and the rhetorical strategies present in the corpus. The results offer strong preliminary validation for the oppositional design of the CAF.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix of CAF Raw Dimension Scores**

| | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth | resentment | justice | fear | hope | fantasy | pragmatism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **tribalism** | 1.00 | **-0.81** | **0.91** | -0.79 | **0.80** | -0.71 | 0.40 | -0.23 | 0.72 | **-0.76** |
| **dignity** | **-0.81** | 1.00 | **-0.87** | 0.67 | -0.52 | **0.87** | -0.58 | 0.50 | **-0.75** | 0.67 |
| **manipulation**| **0.91** | **-0.87** | 1.00 | -0.77 | 0.61 | -0.75 | 0.33 | -0.30 | **0.89** | **-0.91** |
| **truth** | -0.79 | 0.67 | -0.77 | 1.00 | -0.55 | **0.84** | 0.08 | -0.16 | -0.56 | 0.52 |
| **resentment** | **0.80** | -0.52 | 0.61 | -0.55 | 1.00 | -0.34 | 0.41 | -0.07 | 0.48 | -0.51 |
| **justice** | -0.71 | **0.87** | -0.75 | **0.84** | -0.34 | 1.00 | -0.19 | 0.13 | -0.54 | 0.43 |
| **fear** | 0.40 | -0.58 | 0.33 | 0.08 | 0.41 | -0.19 | 1.00 | **-0.87** | 0.30 | -0.30 |
| **hope** | -0.23 | 0.50 | -0.30 | -0.16 | -0.07 | 0.13 | **-0.87** | 1.00 | -0.38 | 0.37 |
| **fantasy** | 0.72 | **-0.75** | **0.89** | -0.56 | 0.48 | -0.54 | 0.30 | -0.38 | 1.00 | **-0.93** |
| **pragmatism** | **-0.76** | 0.67 | **-0.91** | 0.52 | -0.51 | 0.43 | -0.30 | 0.37 | **-0.93** | 1.00 |

*(Note: Correlations with absolute values > 0.75 are bolded for emphasis.)*

Key findings from this matrix include:
*   **Validation of Oppositional Axes:** Every virtue/vice pair exhibits a strong to moderate negative correlation. The strongest are `Pragmatism`/`Fantasy` (r = -0.93), `Hope`/`Fear` (r = -0.87), and `Dignity`/`Tribalism` (r = -0.81). This indicates that, in this corpus, speakers who use one tend not to use the other, supporting the framework's core theoretical premise.
*   **Identification of a "Vice Cluster":** The dimensions of `Tribalism`, `Manipulation`, and `Fantasy` are very strongly and positively inter-correlated. The correlation between `Tribalism` and `Manipulation` is +0.91, and between `Manipulation` and `Fantasy` is +0.89. This suggests a coherent rhetorical meta-strategy built on creating an in-group, simplifying reality, and using deceptive frames. `Resentment` also correlates strongly with this cluster (r = +0.80 with `Tribalism`).
*   **Identification of a "Virtue Cluster":** The dimensions of `Dignity`, `Justice`, and `Truth` are also positively inter-correlated. The relationship between `Dignity` and `Justice` is particularly strong (r = +0.87), as is the one between `Justice` and `Truth` (r = +0.84). This points to a civic meta-strategy grounded in universalism, fairness, and intellectual honesty.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns reveal more than just the validity of individual axes; they map the underlying structure of rhetorical choice in this dataset. The analysis points to two primary, competing logics of political persuasion.

The first is a **civic-republican logic**, characterized by the "virtue cluster." A speaker employing this logic, like John McCain, builds an argument on a foundation of shared `dignity` and appeals to principles of `justice` and `truth`. This approach is inherently inclusionary and grounded in observable reality, as evidenced by the strong positive correlations between these virtues and `pragmatism`. McCain’s call to "find ways to come together" and his pledge to "help him lead us through the many challenges we face" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt) are textual manifestations of this pragmatic, unifying strategy.

The second is a **pathological-populist logic**, characterized by the "vice cluster." This logic, seen in the rhetoric of speakers like Steve King and JD Vance, begins by establishing a `tribal` "us vs. them" frame. This frame is then populated with grievances (`resentment`), reinforced with emotionally charged and simplistic narratives (`manipulation`), and often detached from real-world complexities (`fantasy`). The extremely high negative correlation between `Pragmatism` and `Fantasy` (r = -0.93) and `Pragmatism` and `Manipulation` (r = -0.91) is the statistical signature of this logic's rejection of nuance and complexity.

These findings suggest that the CAF framework does not merely measure ten independent features but captures two holistic, competing approaches to political communication.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness, subject to the aforementioned limitations.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully discriminated between the eight speakers, assigning them to different archetypes and spreading them across the full range of the Civic Character Index. The variance observed in the descriptive statistics further supports the conclusion that the framework is sensitive to differences in rhetorical style.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The strong oppositional correlations and the emergence of coherent virtue/vice clusters suggest a high degree of fit between the framework's theoretical constructs and the empirical patterns within this corpus of American political speech. The framework appears well-suited to analyzing the specific tensions prevalent in this domain.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The analysis highlights the utility of the derived metrics. While the CCI provides an excellent top-line summary, the Tension Indices are indispensable for understanding more complex speakers who blend civic and pathological appeals. The failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function underscores a critical dependency for future work: the need for well-curated corpus metadata to enable more advanced group-comparison analyses.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

This preliminary analysis carries several theoretical implications for the study of political communication. The clear statistical separation between a "virtue cluster" and a "vice cluster" suggests that these rhetorical choices are not ad-hoc but may represent deeply ingrained, systematic strategies. The "vice cluster" in particular—linking `Tribalism`, `Resentment`, `Manipulation`, and `Fantasy`—provides an empirical skeleton for what is often described as populist or demagogic rhetoric. This suggests that a speaker's turn towards one of these vices makes a turn towards the others more likely, creating a self-reinforcing rhetorical system.

Furthermore, the concept of **Character Tension** offers a quantitative handle on the phenomenon of "doublespeak" or strategic ambiguity. Speakers like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who score high on tension, are not merely "in the middle" but are actively engaging in rhetorical contradiction. This may be a deliberate strategy to appeal to multiple audiences simultaneously—for instance, using the language of `justice` to energize a base while employing the `resentment` frame to attack opponents. This moves the analysis beyond a simple good/bad dichotomy to a more sophisticated understanding of rhetorical strategy.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The classification of speakers into archetypes allows for a nuanced comparative analysis.

1.  **The Authentic Virtue Archetype (McCain, Booker, Romney):** These speakers are defined by high CCI scores and very low tension. Their rhetoric is characterized by a consistent appeal to unifying virtues. McCain's concession speech is a paradigmatic example, where he actively suppresses `tribalism` and `resentment` in favor of `dignity` and `pragmatism`.
2.  **The Strategic Pathology Archetype (King, Sanders):** These speakers exhibit negative CCI scores and often moderate-to-high tension. Their primary mode of persuasion relies on the vice cluster. While their specific targets differ, the underlying rhetorical structure is similar: identify an out-group, attribute societal problems to that group's malevolence, and offer a simplistic vision of restoration once that group is defeated. The textual evidence from Sanders, focusing on the "greed of the oligarchs" and a "rigged economy," perfectly illustrates this pattern.
3.  **The Ambiguous/Contradictory Archetype (Ocasio-Cortez, Lewis, Vance):** This group occupies the middle ground. Their CCI scores are closer to zero, and their tension scores can vary. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (CCI = +0.005, Tension = 0.09) is a prime example of a high-tension, neutral-CCI profile. This suggests a rhetorical style that is a near-equal mix of strong virtue appeals (e.g., on behalf of the marginalized) and strong vice appeals (e.g., intense `resentment` and `tribalism` directed at opponents). This complex profile challenges simplistic labels and highlights the need for multi-dimensional analysis.

### Broader Significance and Future Directions

While these findings are preliminary, they point towards the significant potential of the CAF framework. If these patterns hold in larger datasets, this methodology could be used to create large-scale maps of the civic health of a nation's political discourse, track its evolution over time, and compare the rhetorical norms of different political parties or systems.

Future research is essential to validate and expand upon these initial results. The most critical next step is to apply this analysis to a large, longitudinal corpus of political texts. This would allow for the robust testing of the archetypes identified here and would enable researchers to track whether the prevalence of certain rhetorical strategies (e.g., the "vice cluster") is increasing or decreasing over time. Additionally, a corpus with rich metadata (speaker party, office, audience, etc.) would allow for powerful hypothesis testing, such as examining whether rhetorical styles differ systematically between incumbents and challengers, or between different branches of government. Finally, cross-cultural analysis could reveal whether the virtue/vice clusters identified here are specific to the American context or represent more universal patterns in political communication.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, guided by the Civic Analysis Framework v10.0, has provided a structured and empirically grounded evaluation of the civic character of discourse within a small but diverse corpus of political speeches. Despite the significant limitation of its sample size, the study successfully demonstrates the framework's utility in moving beyond anecdotal critique to systematic measurement.

The analysis yielded three key contributions. First, it provided preliminary evidence for the **construct validity** of the CAF, showing that its theoretical oppositions and dimensions map onto statistically significant patterns in real-world language. The strong negative correlations between virtues and vices, and the emergence of coherent rhetorical clusters, suggest the framework is well-founded. Second, it introduced and demonstrated the value of derived metrics like the **Civic Character Index** and **Character Tension Indices**, which together provide a nuanced, multi-faceted portrait of a speaker's rhetorical posture. Third, the analysis identified several distinct **rhetorical archetypes**—from "Authentic Virtue" to "Strategic Pathology"—that offer a new vocabulary for classifying and understanding political communication.

The findings indicate that civic character is not a simple matter of using positive words but a complex interplay of competing values, strategic coherence, and rhetorical intent. By quantifying these dynamics, this research provides a promising, scalable, and transparent methodology for future studies into the nature and health of public discourse. Further research with larger datasets is now required to confirm whether these indicative patterns represent stable and generalizable features of the political landscape.
