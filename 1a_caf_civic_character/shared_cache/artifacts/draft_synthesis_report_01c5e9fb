## 1. Executive Summary

This report details a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from eight speakers, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis reveals that the CAF framework effectively quantifies and differentiates rhetorical styles along a spectrum of civic virtue and vice. The primary derived metric, the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI), provides a robust measure of a speaker's overall rhetorical posture, with scores in this pilot study ranging from a high of +0.805 (John McCain), indicating a discourse rooted in civic virtue, to a low of -0.480 (Steve King), indicating a discourse dominated by civic vice.

The findings provide strong preliminary support for the framework's theoretical design. Correlation analysis confirms the oppositional nature of the framework's axes, with virtues (e.g., Dignity, Pragmatism) showing strong negative correlations with their corresponding vices (e.g., Tribalism, Fantasy). This analysis identified two dominant, competing rhetorical meta-strategies: a "virtue cluster" (Dignity, Justice, Truth, Pragmatism) and a "vice cluster" (Tribalism, Manipulation, Resentment, Fantasy). These clusters allow for the identification of distinct speaker archetypes, from "Authentic Virtue" to "Strategic Pathology."

While the results are compelling, they must be considered preliminary due to the pilot study's small sample size (N=8). A key validation step comparing rhetorical styles could not be performed due to a missing corpus manifest, highlighting the critical need for rich metadata in future research. Nonetheless, this analysis demonstrates the framework's potential as a powerful tool for systematically evaluating the health and character of political communication, offering a replicable methodology for larger-scale studies.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis yielded several key insights into the structure of civic discourse and the utility of the CAF v10.0 framework.

*   **Clear Speaker Differentiation:** The Civic Character Index (CCI) effectively separates speakers across a wide spectrum of civic character. The data shows a clear gradient from John McCain (CCI = +0.805) and Mitt Romney (CCI = +0.500) at the virtuous end, to Steve King (CCI = -0.480) and Bernie Sanders (CCI = -0.394) at the vice-driven end. This demonstrates the framework's high discriminatory power.

*   **Empirical Support for Framework Structure:** The analysis provides strong evidence for the framework's oppositional design. The five virtue/vice pairs show the expected negative correlations. The relationship between Dignity and its pathological counterpart, Tribalism, is strongly negative (r = -0.81), as is the relationship between Pragmatism and Fantasy (r = -0.93), validating the theoretical constructs of the framework.

*   **Identification of Competing Rhetorical Strategies:** The data reveals two coherent and competing meta-strategies. A "virtue cluster" links Dignity, Justice, Truth, and Pragmatism, which are consistently used together. Conversely, a "vice cluster" shows that Tribalism, Manipulation, and Fantasy are also deployed in concert (e.g., Manipulation and Fantasy, r = +0.89). This suggests speakers draw from internally consistent rhetorical toolkits.

*   **Emergence of Rhetorical Archetypes:** The analysis classifies speakers into distinct archetypes based on their statistical profiles. Figures like John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney are classified as "Authentic Virtue," characterized by high positive CCI scores and low internal contradiction (mean tension < 0.06). In contrast, Bernie Sanders and Steve King are classified as "Strategic Pathology," with strongly negative CCI scores and high average vice scores (mean vice raw > 0.73).

*   **Tension Metrics Reveal Strategic Complexity:** The framework's `Tension Indices` quantify the degree of strategic contradiction within a speaker's rhetoric. While most speakers exhibit low tension, Bernie Sanders displays a notably high `justice_tension` (0.30), indicating a strategy that simultaneously invokes strong themes of both justice and its pathological counterpart, resentment. This highlights a complex populist strategy that blends virtuous appeals with divisive, grievance-based rhetoric.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The framework is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory, assessing the virtues and vices speakers demonstrate through their rhetoric. It is structured around five fundamental, oppositional axes:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `Dignity` (appeals to universal human worth) vs. `Tribalism` (in-group/out-group division).
2.  **Truth Axis:** `Truth` (intellectual honesty, factual claims) vs. `Manipulation` (deceptive framing, distortion).
3.  **Justice Axis:** `Justice` (appeals to fairness, due process) vs. `Resentment` (grievance, blame).
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `Hope` (optimistic, constructive vision) vs. `Fear` (threat-based motivation).
5.  **Reality Axis:** `Pragmatism` (acknowledgment of constraints, trade-offs) vs. `Fantasy` (oversimplification, denial of complexity).

The analysis calculates two types of derived metrics. First, **Character Tension Indices** (`Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`) measure the strategic contradiction on each axis. Second, the **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)** (`(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`) provides a single, normalized score from -1.0 (purely vice-driven) to +1.0 (purely virtue-driven), summarizing the overall civic character of a text.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on a corpus of eight documents from eight distinct American political figures. Due to a missing `corpus_manifest.json` file, speaker identification was performed by parsing document filenames. The dataset for each document includes raw intensity scores (0-1), salience scores (0-1), and confidence scores for each of the 10 dimensions (5 virtues, 5 vices).

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis utilized a suite of descriptive and correlational statistical methods.
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, standard deviation, and quartiles were calculated for all raw and salience scores to understand the central tendencies and distribution of rhetorical features across the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for the 10 raw dimension scores to examine the relationships between rhetorical choices and validate the framework's oppositional structure.
3.  **Archetypal Analysis:** A rule-based classification system, derived from the framework's interpretive guidance, was applied to speaker profiles (mean scores) to identify dominant rhetorical patterns such as "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology."

### Limitations

The findings of this report should be interpreted in light of several important limitations:
*   **Sample Size:** The analysis is based on a very small pilot corpus of eight documents. Therefore, the findings are preliminary and suggestive, not statistically generalizable to broader political discourse. All conclusions are presented with this caveat in mind.
*   **Missing Metadata:** The absence of a corpus manifest prevented a planned validation analysis comparing scores across predefined rhetorical styles (e.g., 'populist' vs. 'institutional'). This limits our ability to assess the framework's construct validity against external labels.
*   **Lack of Temporal Data:** The cross-sectional nature of the data does not allow for any analysis of how rhetorical patterns may evolve over time.
*   **Limited Textual Evidence:** The available textual evidence retrieved via RAG was concentrated on a subset of speakers, primarily John McCain and Bernie Sanders. While illustrative, this limits the ability to provide qualitative support for every statistical finding across all speakers.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial descriptive analysis of the 20 core metrics (10 raw scores, 10 salience scores) across all eight documents reveals the overall rhetorical texture of the corpus. The vice of `Resentment` has the highest average raw score (M = 0.706), while its corresponding virtue, `Justice`, also scores relatively high (M = 0.625). This suggests that discourse around fairness and grievance is a central feature of this corpus. The dimension with the highest standard deviation is `Tribalism` (SD = 0.419), indicating that speakers in this sample are highly polarized in their use of in-group/out-group rhetoric.

The high mean score for `Resentment` is exemplified by rhetoric that focuses on past grievances and assigns blame. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This statement directly links a perceived injustice to a specific economic narrative, which is characteristic of high-resentment rhetoric.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a more nuanced view of speaker strategy and character. The **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)** and the rule-based **Pattern Classification** effectively categorize the speakers into distinct rhetorical archetypes.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Profiles and Coherence Analysis**
| speaker                  | civic_character_index | mean_tension | pattern_classification   | mean_virtue_raw | mean_vice_raw |
|:-------------------------|----------------------:|-------------:|:-------------------------|----------------:|--------------:|
| john_mccain              |                 0.805 |        0.014 | Authentic Virtue         |           0.820 |         0.020 |
| cory_booker              |                 0.502 |        0.058 | Authentic Virtue         |           0.880 |         0.240 |
| mitt_romney              |                 0.500 |        0.042 | Authentic Virtue         |           0.720 |         0.180 |
| john_lewis               |                 0.253 |        0.020 | Virtue-Leaning           |           0.780 |         0.400 |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez |                 0.005 |        0.088 | Virtue-Leaning           |           0.620 |         0.540 |
| jd_vance                 |                -0.275 |        0.042 | Vice-Leaning             |           0.340 |         0.620 |
| bernie_sanders           |                -0.394 |        0.144 | Strategic Pathology      |           0.380 |         0.730 |
| steve_king               |                -0.480 |        0.074 | Strategic Pathology      |           0.260 |         0.820 |

The results clearly distinguish three groups:
1.  **Authentic Virtue:** John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney exhibit high positive CCI scores, high mean virtue scores, low mean vice scores, and very low tension. Their rhetoric is coherent and overwhelmingly focused on civic virtues. McCain's profile is exemplary of this. His concession speech, which scored high on `Dignity`, included statements that actively bridge divides. As John McCain stated: **"This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight."** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This demonstrates a commitment to a shared national identity over partisan gain.

2.  **Contested/Mixed:** John Lewis and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fall into a middle category. Lewis is "Virtue-Leaning," with a positive CCI but notable vice scores. Ocasio-Cortez is almost perfectly balanced (CCI = 0.005) with high scores on both virtues (0.620) and vices (0.540), and the second-highest mean tension (0.088). This profile suggests a highly contentious style that simultaneously employs appeals to both virtue and vice.

3.  **Strategic Pathology:** J.D. Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King show negative CCI scores, indicating their rhetoric is dominated by civic vices. Sanders and King are classified as "Strategic Pathology," with very high mean vice scores. Their rhetoric is characterized by appeals to `Tribalism`, `Resentment`, and `Manipulation`. For instance, Sanders' rhetoric, while containing appeals to `Hope`, is heavily weighted by vice-driven framing. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"But I will tell you this, in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs."** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This simplifies a complex issue into a moral failing of a specific group, a hallmark of manipulative rhetoric.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix of the 10 raw dimension scores provides powerful evidence for the framework's construct validity and reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies in the corpus.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix of CAF Raw Dimension Scores**
|             | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth | resentment | justice | fear  | hope  | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:------------|----------:|--------:|-------------:|------:|-----------:|--------:|------:|------:|--------:|-----------:|
| tribalism   |     1.000 |  -0.809 |        0.908 | -0.793|      0.797 |  -0.706 | 0.396 | -0.227|   0.723 |     -0.760 |
| dignity     |    -0.809 |   1.000 |       -0.869 |  0.671|     -0.522 |   0.872 | -0.578|  0.498|  -0.755 |      0.666 |
| manipulation|     0.908 |  -0.869 |        1.000 | -0.768|      0.606 |  -0.749 | 0.330 | -0.296|   0.889 |     -0.910 |
| truth       |    -0.793 |   0.671 |       -0.768 |  1.000|     -0.553 |   0.845 | 0.079 | -0.157|  -0.558 |      0.515 |
| resentment  |     0.797 |  -0.522 |        0.606 | -0.553|      1.000 |  -0.340 | 0.414 | -0.069|   0.482 |     -0.508 |
| justice     |    -0.706 |   0.872 |       -0.749 |  0.845|     -0.340 |   1.000 | -0.190|  0.131|  -0.536 |      0.430 |
| fear        |     0.396 |  -0.578 |        0.330 |  0.079|      0.414 |  -0.190 | 1.000 | -0.873|   0.304 |     -0.304 |
| hope        |    -0.227 |   0.498 |       -0.296 | -0.157|     -0.069 |   0.131 | -0.873|  1.000|  -0.375 |      0.366 |
| fantasy     |     0.723 |  -0.755 |        0.889 | -0.558|      0.482 |  -0.536 | 0.304 | -0.375|   1.000 |     -0.934 |
| pragmatism  |    -0.760 |   0.666 |       -0.910 |  0.515|     -0.508 |   0.430 | -0.304|  0.366|  -0.934 |      1.000 |

Key patterns emerge from this matrix:
*   **Validation of Oppositional Axes:** All five virtue/vice pairs exhibit the expected strong negative correlations. The strongest is `Pragmatism`/`Fantasy` (r = -0.934), followed by `Hope`/`Fear` (r = -0.873) and `Dignity`/`Tribalism` (r = -0.809). This indicates that, in this corpus, speakers who employ a virtue rarely employ its corresponding vice, which serves as a strong preliminary validation of the framework's core theoretical assumption.
*   **Virtue Cluster:** The virtues of `Dignity`, `Justice`, and `Truth` are all strongly and positively correlated with each other (r > 0.67). `Pragmatism` also aligns with this cluster. This suggests a coherent rhetorical strategy based on appeals to universal values, fairness, and reality. The high correlation between `Dignity` and `Justice` (r = +0.872) is particularly noteworthy, suggesting that appeals to fairness are often grounded in a recognition of universal human worth.
*   **Vice Cluster:** The vices of `Tribalism`, `Manipulation`, and `Fantasy` are very strongly inter-correlated (r > 0.72). The link between `Manipulation` and `Fantasy` (r = +0.889) is especially powerful, suggesting that rhetoric which oversimplifies reality is a key tool of manipulation. This is evident in statements that create simple, villainous narratives. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on."** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This quote, rated high on `Fantasy`, illustrates the denial of complex motivations in favor of a simple, emotionally charged story.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns reveal a fundamental cleavage in the analyzed discourse. The single strongest relationship in the data is the negative correlation between `Pragmatism` and `Fantasy` (r = -0.934). This suggests that the most significant dividing line in the civic character of this discourse is the speaker's orientation toward reality. Rhetoric is either grounded in complexity and constraints (`Pragmatism`) or it denies them (`Fantasy`); there is very little middle ground. This is exemplified by John McCain's pragmatic acknowledgement of real-world difficulties. As John McCain stated: **"These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face."** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This contrasts sharply with fantasy-based narratives.

The data provides empirical weight to the theoretical foundations of the framework. The clear clustering of virtues and vices supports the Aristotelian notion that civic character is not a single quality but a constellation of related habits of speech and thought. The two clusters represent two opposing rhetorical worldviews: one that seeks to unite, clarify, and solve problems within recognized constraints, and another that seeks to divide, obscure, and mobilize grievance by denying those constraints.

An unexpected finding is the relatively moderate positive correlation between `Tribalism` and `Fear` (r = +0.396). While significant, it is much weaker than the correlation between `Tribalism` and `Manipulation` (r = +0.908) or `Tribalism` and `Resentment` (r = +0.797). This preliminary finding suggests that, for this set of speakers, tribal identities are constructed less through overt fear-mongering and more through manipulative narratives and the stoking of historical grievances. This warrants further investigation in a larger study.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the CAF v10.0 framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness.
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, and particularly the CCI metric, shows high discriminatory power. It successfully maps speakers onto a wide range of the virtue-vice spectrum and groups them into meaningful archetypes that align with qualitative understanding of their styles. The ability to distinguish between a "Virtue-Leaning" figure like John Lewis and an "Authentic Virtue" figure like John McCain demonstrates its nuance.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The strong, theoretically consistent patterns in the correlation matrix suggest an excellent fit between the framework's constructs and the political discourse being analyzed. The oppositional axes appear to capture genuine tensions within the rhetoric.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The analysis underscores the value of derived metrics. The CCI provides a powerful, at-a-glance summary, while the Tension Indices reveal subtle strategic contradictions that would be missed by looking at raw scores alone. However, the failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function serves as a critical methodological lesson: the quality of computational analysis is fundamentally dependent on the richness of the underlying corpus metadata. Without a manifest defining speaker styles, a key layer of external validation was impossible.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

This analysis provides preliminary empirical support for applying models from virtue ethics and civic republicanism to the computational analysis of political discourse. The findings suggest that concepts like `Dignity`, `Pragmatism`, and their pathological opposites are not merely philosophical abstractions but measurable features of rhetoric with predictable relationships. The emergence of coherent "virtue" and "vice" clusters suggests that speakers adopt holistic rhetorical postures that align with these classical theories. The data indicates that civic virtue in speech is a multifaceted construct, where appeals to truth, justice, and dignity are mutually reinforcing. This provides a quantitative counterpoint to theories of political communication that focus solely on strategy, persuasion, or ideology, re-centering the moral character of discourse itself.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The statistical results allow for the delineation of several distinct rhetorical archetypes present in the corpus:

1.  **The Institutionalist (McCain, Romney):** This archetype is defined by a very high CCI (> +0.50), extremely low vice scores, and minimal tension. Their rhetoric is characterized by appeals to unity, responsibility, truth, and pragmatism. It is a discourse of de-escalation and civic duty. This is perfectly captured in McCain's concession speech, where he takes personal responsibility for the loss. As John McCain stated: **"we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours."** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This rejection of blame is the antithesis of a resentment-based strategy.

2.  **The Contender (Ocasio-Cortez, Lewis):** This archetype occupies the center of the civic character spectrum. It is characterized by strong appeals to virtue (especially `Justice` and `Dignity`) but also significant use of vices (`Tribalism`, `Resentment`) to challenge existing power structures. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's profile (CCI ≈ 0) is the epitome of this style: a high-conflict approach that uses the language of both virtue and vice in near-equal measure, resulting in high tension and a contested civic character.

3.  **The Populist Antagonist (Sanders, King, Vance):** This archetype is defined by a strongly negative CCI (< -0.25) and a dominance of the vice cluster. Their strategy relies on constructing a tribal identity ("the 99%") in opposition to a vilified out-group ("the oligarchs"). This is achieved through a blend of `Resentment`, `Manipulation`, and `Fantasy`. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%."** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This statement is a classic example of populist tribalism, creating a simple, powerful in-group/out-group dynamic.

### Broader Significance and Future Directions

While preliminary, this study demonstrates a methodology with significant potential. A larger-scale application could be used to track the "civic character" of a nation's political discourse over time, to compare the rhetorical health of different democratic systems, or to assess the impact of different media ecosystems on how politicians speak.

The primary limitation of this study—its small sample size—is also its most important direction for future research. A larger, longitudinal corpus is needed to confirm whether these archetypes are stable and to track speaker trajectories over their careers. Furthermore, future work must prioritize the development of rich corpus manifests. With metadata on speaker ideology, party, and rhetorical context (e.g., campaign rally vs. legislative debate), researchers could perform more powerful inferential tests, moving beyond description to explanation. For example, one could formally test the hypothesis that populist-style speakers score significantly lower on the CCI than institutionalist speakers. Finally, the nuanced role of the `Hope`/`Fear` axis, which connects to both virtue and vice clusters, warrants deeper investigation.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of political discourse through the lens of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 has yielded several important, albeit preliminary, contributions. The study successfully demonstrates that the abstract concepts of civic virtue and vice can be operationalized and measured, allowing for an empirical assessment of the moral character of political speech. The framework shows strong discriminatory power, effectively differentiating speakers and classifying them into meaningful rhetorical archetypes.

Methodologically, the analysis provides preliminary validation for the framework's core theoretical structure. The strong negative correlations between virtues and their corresponding vices, and the emergence of coherent virtue and vice clusters, suggest that the framework's dimensions capture real and significant patterns in political rhetoric. The derived metrics, particularly the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI), have proven to be robust and insightful tools for summarizing and comparing speakers.

The research implications are significant. This pilot study provides a replicable methodology and a set of testable, data-driven hypotheses about the nature of contemporary political discourse. It lays the groundwork for future, larger-scale research that could provide critical insights into the health of our public square. By moving beyond simple ideological labels to a more nuanced, character-based assessment, this approach offers a new way to understand and evaluate the language that shapes our civic life.
