### **Executive Summary**

This report details the quantitative analysis of eight political texts using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.3. The analysis aimed to assess the framework's capacity to differentiate speakers, validate its theoretical structure, and identify patterns in civic discourse.

Key findings indicate that the framework's core theoretical assumptions are supported by the data. A strong negative correlation was observed between virtue and pathology dimensions, such as Dignity and Tribalism (r = -0.79) [2], and between the composite Virtue and Pathology indices (r = -0.77) [3]. This supports the framework's bipolar axis design. Dimensions within the virtue construct (e.g., Pragmatism and Dignity, r = 0.94) [4] and within the pathology construct (e.g., Manipulation and Fear, r = 0.93) [5] were strongly correlated, suggesting internal consistency.

The analysis also revealed a very strong positive correlation (r = 0.94) between Tribalism and Manipulation scores [6], indicating a potential "pathology syndrome" where these rhetorical strategies are frequently co-deployed. The Civic Character Index (CCI) and the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (SW-CCI) were almost perfectly correlated (r = 0.997) [7], suggesting that the presence of virtues and pathologies, rather than their rhetorical salience, is the primary driver of the overall character score in this dataset.

A primary limitation of this study is the small sample size (n=8), which precludes definitive statistical tests of significance for speaker differentiation (e.g., ANOVA). All findings should be interpreted as preliminary, pending analysis on a larger corpus.

### **Collaborator Analysis**

This section examines specific claims and hypotheses based on the statistical results.

**Claim 001: Speaker Differentiation**
- **Hypothesis (H1):** The 10 CAF dimensions will show statistically significant differences between speakers.
- **Testability:** This hypothesis is not statistically testable with the current dataset (n=8). While descriptive statistics show variance in the composite Civic Character Index (Mean = 0.56, SD = 0.27, Range = 0.23 to 0.89), a formal ANOVA test for significant differences between speakers cannot be reliably performed.
- **Evidence:**
    - "When here in our Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Article one of our Constitution says, \"All legislative power, power, all legislative, all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.\" That's here. The House and the Senate." [1]
    - "The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Senator Barack Obama to congratulate him... on being elected the next president of the country that we both love." [2]

**Claim 002: Identity Axis Construct Validity**
- **Hypothesis:** Exploratory. This claim tests the theoretical assumption that Dignity and Tribalism are opposing constructs.
- **Statistical Result:** A strong negative Pearson correlation (r = -0.79) was found between `dignity_score` and `tribalism_score` [2].
- **Evidence:**
    - "It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, \"Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.\"" [3]
    - "we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own." [4]

**Claim 003: Composite Index Validity**
- **Hypothesis:** Exploratory. This claim tests the structural validity of the composite Virtue and Pathology indices as opposing constructs.
- **Statistical Result:** A strong negative Pearson correlation (r = -0.77) was found between the `virtue_index` and the `pathology_index` [3].
- **Evidence:**
    - "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [5]
    - "As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential." [6]

**Claim 004: Impact of Salience Weighting**
- **Hypothesis (H3):** MC-SCI scores will vary meaningfully between speakers, indicating different levels of character coherence.
- **Testability:** The core of this claim can be evaluated by comparing the standard Civic Character Index (CCI) with the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (SW-CCI).
- **Statistical Result:** A near-perfect positive Pearson correlation (r = 0.997) was observed between the `civic_character_index` and the `salience_weighted_civic_character_index` [7]. This indicates that weighting by salience did not substantially alter the character assessment rankings in this sample.
- **Evidence:**
    - "His success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving." [8]
    - "We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity" [9]

**Claim 005: Virtue Construct Internal Consistency**
- **Hypothesis:** Exploratory. This claim examines the internal consistency of the virtue construct by correlating two of its components, Pragmatism and Dignity.
- **Statistical Result:** A very strong positive Pearson correlation (r = 0.94) was found between `pragmatism_score` and `dignity_score` [4].
- **Evidence:**
    - "But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside." [10]
    - "we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own." [4]

**Claim 006: Pathology Construct Internal Consistency**
- **Hypothesis:** Exploratory. This claim examines the internal consistency of the pathology construct by correlating two of its components, Manipulation and Fear.
- **Statistical Result:** A very strong positive Pearson correlation (r = 0.93) was found between `manipulation_score` and `fear_score` [5].
- **Evidence:**
    - "Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience." [11]
    - "This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American." [12]

**Claim 007: Character Signature Patterns**
- **Hypothesis (H2):** Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices.
- **Testability:** This claim is partially challenged by the statistical finding. A strong correlation between two pathological dimensions suggests a common pattern rather than a unique signature.
- **Statistical Result:** A very strong positive Pearson correlation (r = 0.94) was found between `tribalism_score` and `manipulation_score` [6]. This suggests a potential "pathology syndrome" where appeals to tribalism are strongly coupled with manipulative rhetoric.
- **Evidence:**
    - "They want us to think that our lives are suffering because of the LGBT kid down the street or because of the mixed status family or the dreamer down the block who's just trying to make a better life for themselves. But we're smarter than that Greeley." [13]
    - "It’s another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here, one who had been encountered by law enforcement officers in the past, one whom I believe ICE declined, uh, to pick up and place into removal proceedings." [14]

**Claim 008: Cross-Axis Rhetorical Patterns**
- **Hypothesis:** Exploratory. This claim tests the relationship between the Truth and Reality axes.
- **Statistical Result:** A strong negative Pearson correlation (r = -0.87) was found between `truth_score` and `fantasy_score`. This suggests a potential overarching pattern of reality-based versus non-reality-based discourse that cuts across the framework's defined axes.
- **Evidence:**
    - "And you’d lay your head down on the pillow at night having trouble to sleep, thinking, \"What am I going to do tomorrow? I couldn’t react today. What am I going to do tomorrow? Lord, wake me up with an idea on how to, how to preserve our Constitution,\"" [15]
    - "These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face." [16]

### **Technical Transparency**

- **Limitations:** The primary limitation is the small sample size (n=8), which prevents robust statistical testing of hypotheses related to inter-group differences (e.g., ANOVA for speaker differentiation). The findings from correlation analyses should be considered preliminary and require validation with a larger, more diverse corpus.
