The speaker frequently employs opposing concepts simultaneously (e.g., Tribalism via class-based 'us vs. them' framing and Dignity via appeals to universal worth; Fear of oligarchy and Hope in collective action). This creates high tension scores but is a deliberate and salient rhetorical strategy, which I have scored accordingly. The analysis focuses on the speaker's own rhetoric, not just the accusations made against others.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribalism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"manipulation\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.4,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.85\n        },\n        \"truth\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"resentment\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"justice\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"fantasy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"pragmatism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribalism\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country and they derive their power from dividing working people apart.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"us_vs_them_framing\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"dignity\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"explicit_appeal\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"manipulation\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"And the clever thing that these guys sell is making working people like you and me believe that we're just one step outside from that club, that we're just a little bit out from being able to be a billionaire too.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"context_type\": \"accusation_of_deception\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"truth\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"And so now they're trying to play a game and say, \\\"We didn't do that,\\\" because they did by proxy.
