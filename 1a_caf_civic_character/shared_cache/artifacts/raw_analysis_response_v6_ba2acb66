The document exhibits extremely strong and salient rhetoric along the axes of Tribalism, Resentment, Manipulation, and Fear, primarily driven by graphic anecdotes about crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The appeals to Justice and Truth are present but serve as a framing device for the more dominant pathological dimensions."
