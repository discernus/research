The document exhibits strong rhetoric across multiple axes, often blending virtuous and pathological appeals simultaneously (e.g., framing a tribal conflict of 'class vs. oligarchs' as a fight for universal dignity). This results in high scores on opposing dimensions within the same axis, reflecting a complex and intentionally layered rhetorical strategy."
