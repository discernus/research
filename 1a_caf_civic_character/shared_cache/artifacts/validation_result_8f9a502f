    "The experiment's expected outcomes include 'ANOVA results demonstrating significant differences between speakers'. However, the corpus only contains 8 documents. With such a small sample size (N=8), any statistical tests like ANOVA will have very low statistical power, making it difficult to detect true effects or draw reliable conclusions about group differences (e.g., institutional vs. populist)."
