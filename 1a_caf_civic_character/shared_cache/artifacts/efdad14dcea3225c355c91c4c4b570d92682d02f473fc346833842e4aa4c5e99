{"experiment_summary": "This analysis plan outlines the mathematical operations to investigate the evolution of civic character patterns across political eras and ideological affiliations, based on a 2x3 factorial design. It aims to identify main effects of era and ideology on character dimensions using available statistical tools. Due to the limited set of available tools, direct testing of interaction effects (H3), correlation with MC-SCI scores (H4, as MC-SCI is not an available column), and comparison of model variance (H5) are not directly supported by this plan. The plan focuses on descriptive statistics, main effect analyses, and inter-dimensional correlations.", "tasks": {"descriptive_stats_character_dimensions": {"tool": "descriptive_stats", "parameters":
