The analysis focuses on the clear and repeated use of in-group/out-group framing (Tribalism), grievance-based arguments (Resentment), and threat-focused language (Fear), which are the dominant dimensions. Virtuous dimensions like Dignity and Justice are largely absent or subordinated to the nationalist frame."
