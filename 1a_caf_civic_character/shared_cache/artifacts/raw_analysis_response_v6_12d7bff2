The analysis focused on identifying the dominant 'us vs. them' class narrative and the corresponding emotional and moral appeals. The key challenge was distinguishing between the speaker's own rhetoric and her accusations about her opponents' rhetoric, with scores reflecting both where applicable. All 10 dimensions were scored as required."
