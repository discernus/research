    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on a speech advocating for the First Step Act. The speaker, Cory Booker, employs a strong rhetorical strategy combining a harsh critique of the existing criminal justice system with a hopeful, pragmatic call for bipartisan reform. The primary rhetorical axes are Justice (Resentment vs. Justice) and Emotional (Fear vs. Hope), supported by appeals to Truth and Dignity. The speech is a clear fit for the framework, exhibiting high intensity and salience across several key dimensions."
