    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the speaker's rhetorical strategies for constructing his own authority and defining ingroup/outgroup identities. The central narrative is a populist appeal, contrasting a virtuous, nationalistic ingroup of 'the American people' with a detached, self-interested 'elite' outgroup. The speaker heavily relies on personal biography and shared heritage to establish authority and build a connection with the audience."
