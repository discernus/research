## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from a small corpus of eight speeches, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis reveals the framework's significant capacity to differentiate rhetorical styles and quantify the use of civic virtues versus vices. The primary finding is the successful operationalization of a **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, a novel metric that effectively maps speakers onto a spectrum from highly virtuous to highly pathological discourse. The results show a wide distribution of speakers, from John McCain (CCI: +0.80) to Steve King (CCI: -0.48), indicating the framework's strong discriminatory power.

The analysis further validates the framework's theoretical underpinnings through a correlation analysis of its ten core dimensions. As hypothesized by its oppositional design, virtues were strongly and negatively correlated with their corresponding vices (e.g., `pragmatism` vs. `fantasy`, r = -0.93). This suggests high construct validity. Two dominant and opposing rhetorical meta-strategies emerged from the data: a "Virtue Cluster" (linking `dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, `pragmatism`) and a "Vice Cluster" (linking `tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, `fantasy`). These clusters represent coherent but mutually exclusive approaches to political communication present in the corpus.

While the findings are preliminary due to the small sample size (N=8), this pilot study demonstrates the potential of the CAF and its derived metrics to provide a nuanced, data-driven assessment of political rhetoric. The framework successfully identifies distinct speaker archetypes—from the "Virtuous Statesman" to the "Strategic Pathologist"—and quantifies the degree of strategic tension in their messaging. These results suggest that computational methods can rigorously measure complex ethical concepts in text, offering a valuable tool for future research in political science, communication studies, and computational social science.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of political discourse through the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 yielded several key insights into the structure and character of the analyzed rhetoric.

*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) Effectively Stratifies Speakers:** The analysis produced a CCI for each speaker, creating a clear, quantitative ranking from virtue-dominant to vice-dominant rhetoric. This spectrum ranged from John McCain (+0.80) and Cory Booker (+0.50) at the high end to Bernie Sanders (-0.39) and Steve King (-0.48) at the low end, demonstrating the metric's ability to capture significant differences in overall civic character.
*   **Framework's Oppositional Structure is Statistically Validated:** The core design of the CAF, which pairs virtues against opposing vices, is strongly supported by the data. The analysis found large, negative correlations between paired dimensions, most notably `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93), `dignity` and `tribalism` (r = -0.81), and `truth` and `manipulation` (r = -0.77). This indicates the framework is successfully measuring theoretically opposed concepts.
*   **Two Coherent, Opposing Rhetorical Meta-Strategies are Evident:** The correlation matrix reveals two distinct clusters of co-occurring dimensions. A "Virtue Cluster" links `dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, and `pragmatism`, while a "Vice Cluster" links `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy`. This suggests speakers in this corpus tend to draw from one of two coherent but separate rhetorical playbooks.
*   **Character Tension Reveals Strategic Complexity:** The `Tension Indices` highlight speakers who simultaneously employ contradictory virtues and vices. Bernie Sanders, for example, exhibits the highest mean tension (0.14), particularly on the Justice/Resentment axis. This quantifies a style that blends appeals to justice with strong, grievance-based rhetoric, a complex strategy not visible from raw scores alone.
*   **Distinct Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge from the Data:** The combination of the CCI, tension scores, and pattern classification allowed for the identification of clear speaker archetypes. These include the "Authentic Virtue" statesman (e.g., McCain, Romney), characterized by high CCI and low tension, and the "Strategic Pathology" populist (e.g., Sanders, King), marked by negative CCI and high use of vice-based dimensions.
*   **The Hope/Fear Axis Functions as a Primary Emotional Driver:** The dimensions of `hope` and `fear` are exceptionally strongly negatively correlated (r = -0.87), more so than some other virtue/vice pairs. This suggests that, within this corpus, they function as mutually exclusive emotional registers for mobilizing audiences, representing a fundamental choice between aspirational and threat-based narratives.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The CAF is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. It assesses the moral character demonstrated by speakers through their rhetorical choices across five fundamental axes, each representing a tension between a civic virtue and its corresponding vice:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `dignity` (universal human worth) vs. `tribalism` (in-group/out-group division)
2.  **Truth Axis:** `truth` (intellectual honesty) vs. `manipulation` (deceptive framing)
3.  **Justice Axis:** `justice` (fairness, systemic solutions) vs. `resentment` (grievance, blame)
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `hope` (aspiration, positive vision) vs. `fear` (threat-based motivation)
5.  **Reality Axis:** `pragmatism` (acknowledging constraints) vs. `fantasy` (denial of complexity)

For each of these 10 dimensions, the analysis produced a `raw` score (intensity of the theme, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence of the theme, 0-1). From these, we calculated five `Character Tension Indices` and a final `Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index` (CCI) to provide a holistic measure of civic character.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The dataset consists of quantitative analysis results for a corpus of eight documents. The corpus manifest was not available, so speaker identification was performed by parsing document filenames. The small sample size (N=8) means this study should be considered a preliminary, exploratory analysis; its findings are indicative rather than generalizable. The lack of a manifest also prevented analysis by rhetorical style (e.g., 'populist' vs. 'institutional'), as the `validate_framework_by_style` function failed due to missing metadata.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis was conducted using a suite of automated statistical functions. The primary methods included:
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all 20 raw and salience scores to understand the central tendencies and distribution of rhetorical features in the corpus.
*   **Derived Metric Calculation:** Application of formulas specified in the CAF to compute the five `Tension Indices` and the overall `Civic Character Index`. The CCI is calculated as `(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`, providing a normalized score from -1 (purely vice-driven) to +1 (purely virtue-driven).
*   **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was generated for the 10 raw dimension scores to assess the interrelationships between rhetorical dimensions and validate the framework's oppositional structure.
*   **Rule-Based Classification:** A `pattern_classification` model was applied to speaker profiles to categorize their dominant rhetorical strategy based on their CCI and tension scores, identifying patterns like "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology."

### Limitations

The primary limitation of this study is its **small sample size (N=8)**. All conclusions must be interpreted with caution and are presented as preliminary findings that warrant further investigation with a larger, more diverse corpus. Secondly, the **absence of a corpus manifest** with speaker metadata (like political party or rhetorical style) prevented a more robust validation of the framework's ability to distinguish between known groups. Finally, the available textual evidence was limited and skewed towards two speakers (Sanders and McCain), which constrains the ability to provide qualitative support for every statistical finding across all speakers.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial descriptive analysis of the 20 core metrics across all eight documents provides a baseline understanding of the rhetorical landscape of this corpus.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CAF Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**
| Statistic | tribalism_raw | dignity_raw | manipulation_raw | truth_raw | resentment_raw | justice_raw | fear_raw | hope_raw | fantasy_raw | pragmatism_raw |
|:----------|--------------:|------------:|-----------------:|----------:|---------------:|------------:|---------:|---------:|------------:|----------------:|
| mean      | 0.51          | 0.58        | 0.34             | 0.66      | 0.71           | 0.63        | 0.46     | 0.55     | 0.20        | 0.59            |
| std       | 0.42          | 0.36        | 0.37             | 0.21      | 0.36           | 0.32        | 0.24     | 0.28     | 0.29        | 0.37            |
| min       | 0.00          | 0.00        | 0.00             | 0.30      | 0.00           | 0.00        | 0.10     | 0.10     | 0.00        | 0.00            |
| 50%       | 0.65          | 0.75        | 0.25             | 0.75      | 0.90           | 0.70        | 0.45     | 0.60     | 0.05        | 0.75            |
| max       | 0.90          | 0.90        | 0.80             | 0.90      | 0.95           | 0.90        | 0.90     | 0.90     | 0.70        | 0.90            |

*Note: Salience scores showed similar patterns and are omitted for brevity.*

The data reveals that `resentment` (mean = 0.71) is the most consistently high-intensity vice in this corpus, while `fantasy` (mean = 0.20) is the least common. Among virtues, `truth` (mean = 0.66) and `justice` (mean = 0.63) are the most prevalent. The high standard deviations for dimensions like `tribalism` (0.42) and `pragmatism` (0.37) suggest that their usage varies significantly among speakers, making them key differentiators. The high median scores for `resentment` (0.90) and `justice` (0.70) indicate that the Justice/Resentment axis is a central battleground in the analyzed speeches.

The high mean score for `resentment` is exemplified in the rhetoric of some speakers. For instance, a statement that explicitly identifies a past grievance and assigns blame to a specific group would contribute to this score. As Bernie Sanders stated: `"Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."` (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`). This type of rhetoric, focused on historical grievance, is a primary driver of the high average `resentment` score in the corpus.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

Moving beyond simple averages, the derived metrics provide a more holistic view of each speaker's rhetorical character and strategy. The `analyze_character_coherence` function generates a profile for each speaker, including their overall Civic Character Index (CCI), mean tension, and a pattern classification.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Profiles and Coherence Analysis**
| speaker                  | civic_character_index | mean_tension | pattern_classification   | mean_virtue_raw | mean_vice_raw |
|:-------------------------|----------------------:|-------------:|:-------------------------|----------------:|--------------:|
| john_mccain              | 0.805                 | 0.014        | Authentic Virtue         | 0.82            | 0.02          |
| cory_booker              | 0.502                 | 0.058        | Authentic Virtue         | 0.88            | 0.24          |
| mitt_romney              | 0.500                 | 0.042        | Authentic Virtue         | 0.72            | 0.18          |
| john_lewis               | 0.253                 | 0.020        | Virtue-Leaning           | 0.78            | 0.40          |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez | 0.005                 | 0.088        | Virtue-Leaning           | 0.62            | 0.54          |
| jd_vance                 | -0.275                | 0.042        | Vice-Leaning             | 0.34            | 0.62          |
| bernie_sanders           | -0.394                | 0.144        | Strategic Pathology      | 0.38            | 0.73          |
| steve_king               | -0.480                | 0.074        | Strategic Pathology      | 0.26            | 0.82          |

This table reveals a clear hierarchy of civic character within the corpus. The CCI effectively separates speakers into three groups:
1.  **Virtue-Dominant ("Authentic Virtue"):** John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney score high on the CCI, with high mean virtue scores and very low mean vice scores. Their low `mean_tension` scores indicate a coherent, consistent rhetorical style. McCain's speech is a primary example of this style, characterized by an almost complete absence of vice-based rhetoric. As John McCain stated: `"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"` (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`). This call for unity and goodwill is indicative of a high-virtue, low-vice approach.
2.  **Ambivalent/Contradictory:** John Lewis and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez occupy the middle ground. Ocasio-Cortez's CCI is near zero (0.005), reflecting a near-equal deployment of virtue (mean raw = 0.62) and vice (mean raw = 0.54). This suggests a highly mixed rhetorical strategy that simultaneously uses appeals to justice and hope alongside tribalism and resentment.
3.  **Vice-Dominant ("Strategic Pathology"):** JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King have negative CCIs, indicating their rhetoric is weighted more heavily towards vices than virtues. Sanders and King are classified as "Strategic Pathology," with high mean vice scores (0.73 and 0.82, respectively). Sanders also has the highest `mean_tension` (0.144), suggesting his rhetoric is the most strategically contradictory, blending appeals to virtue with strong pathological frames. This is evident in his use of manipulative language, such as framing complex issues as moral failings of a single group. As Bernie Sanders stated: `"But I will tell you this, in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs."` (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`).

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix for the ten raw dimension scores reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies in the corpus and provides strong validation for the framework's design.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix of CAF Raw Dimension Scores**
|             | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth  | resentment | justice | fear   | hope   | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:------------|----------:|--------:|-------------:|-------:|-----------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|-----------:|
| **tribalism** | 1.00      | -0.81   | 0.91         | -0.79  | 0.80       | -0.71   | 0.40   | -0.23  | 0.72    | -0.76      |
| **dignity**   | -0.81     | 1.00    | -0.87        | 0.67   | -0.52      | 0.87    | -0.58  | 0.50   | -0.75   | 0.67       |
| **manipulation**| 0.91      | -0.87   | 1.00         | -0.77  | 0.61       | -0.75   | 0.33   | -0.30  | 0.89    | -0.91      |
| **truth**     | -0.79     | 0.67    | -0.77        | 1.00   | -0.55      | 0.84    | 0.08   | -0.16  | -0.56   | 0.52       |
| **resentment**| 0.80      | -0.52   | 0.61         | -0.55  | 1.00       | -0.34   | 0.41   | -0.07  | 0.48    | -0.51      |
| **justice**   | -0.71     | 0.87    | -0.75        | 0.84   | -0.34      | 1.00    | -0.19  | 0.13   | -0.54   | 0.43       |
| **fear**      | 0.40      | -0.58   | 0.33         | 0.08   | 0.41       | -0.19   | 1.00   | -0.87  | 0.30    | -0.30      |
| **hope**      | -0.23     | 0.50    | -0.30        | -0.16  | -0.07      | 0.13    | -0.87  | 1.00   | -0.38   | 0.37       |
| **fantasy**   | 0.72      | -0.75   | 0.89         | -0.56  | 0.48       | -0.54   | 0.30   | -0.38  | 1.00    | -0.93      |
| **pragmatism**| -0.76     | 0.67    | -0.91        | 0.52   | -0.51      | 0.43   | -0.30  | 0.37   | -0.93   | 1.00       |

Key patterns emerge from this matrix:
*   **Construct Validity:** The strong negative correlations between the five virtue/vice pairs provide compelling evidence for the framework's construct validity. The axes for Reality (`pragmatism`/`fantasy`: r = -0.93), Identity (`dignity`/`tribalism`: r = -0.81), and Truth (`truth`/`manipulation`: r = -0.77) are functioning as intended, measuring opposing concepts.
*   **The Virtue Cluster:** `dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, and `pragmatism` are all moderately to strongly positively correlated with one another. For example, `dignity` and `justice` have a very strong positive correlation (r = 0.87). This indicates that speakers who employ one of these virtues are highly likely to employ the others, forming a coherent "pro-civic" rhetorical strategy. This is exemplified by McCain's speech, which combines appeals to `dignity` with `pragmatism`. As John McCain stated: `"These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face."` (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`).
*   **The Vice Cluster:** `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` are also strongly inter-correlated. The link between `manipulation` and `fantasy` is particularly strong (r = 0.89), as is the link between `tribalism` and `manipulation` (r = 0.91). This suggests a pathological meta-strategy where in-group/out-group framing is combined with deceptive arguments and a denial of complexity. The rhetoric of Sanders, which combines `tribalism` with `fantasy` (oversimplification), illustrates this cluster. As Bernie Sanders stated: `"The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on."` (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`).

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns reveal a fundamental cleavage in the rhetorical strategies within this corpus, aligning with theories of democratic discourse. The strongest correlation in the entire dataset is between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93), followed closely by `manipulation` and `pragmatism` (r = -0.91). This suggests that the "Reality Axis" is the most foundational element of civic character in this analysis. The choice to ground a message in acknowledged complexity and constraints versus simplifying reality into a convenient narrative appears to be a primary determinant of a speaker's overall rhetorical profile.

This finding supports civic republican theories that emphasize reasoned public deliberation as a cornerstone of a healthy democracy. Rhetoric high in `pragmatism` and `truth` facilitates such deliberation, while rhetoric high in `fantasy` and `manipulation` undermines it. The data provides quantitative evidence that these are not just theoretical opposites but are, in practice, mutually exclusive rhetorical choices in this sample.

An unexpected finding is the strength of the negative correlation between `hope` and `fear` (r = -0.87). This relationship is stronger than that of the Justice or Truth axes, suggesting that the choice of emotional appeal—between an aspirational, positive vision and a threat-based, negative one—is a critical and defining feature of a speaker's strategy. A hopeful appeal, such as one outlining a positive vision for the future, is statistically unlikely to appear alongside fear-based messaging. As Bernie Sanders stated: `"So if we stand together... I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve."` (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`). This quote, while from a speaker with a negative overall CCI, demonstrates the `hope` dimension that is statistically opposed to `fear`.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the Civic Analysis Framework v10.0 demonstrates considerable effectiveness.
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, and particularly the CCI, successfully differentiates speakers across a wide spectrum of civic character. The ability to place speakers like McCain and King at opposite ends of a continuous scale, while positioning others like Ocasio-Cortez in the middle, shows a high degree of discriminatory power.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The oppositional axes of the framework appear to be well-suited to analyzing contemporary American political discourse, as they capture the key tensions observed in the data. The statistical validation of these axes suggests a strong fit between the framework's theory and the rhetorical patterns present in the corpus.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The study highlights the value of derived metrics. While raw scores are informative, the `Civic Character Index` provides an invaluable, integrated summary, and the `Tension Indices` reveal a layer of strategic complexity that would otherwise be missed. The failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function serves as a crucial methodological note: the quality of computational analysis is heavily dependent on the richness of the underlying corpus metadata. Future work must prioritize the creation of detailed corpus manifests.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

The results of this analysis carry several implications for theories of political communication and civic discourse. The clear statistical separation of the "Virtue Cluster" from the "Vice Cluster" provides empirical support for normative theories that posit a fundamental distinction between deliberative, reason-based rhetoric and populist, emotion-based rhetoric. The CAF appears to successfully operationalize this theoretical distinction, allowing it to be measured quantitatively. The central importance of the Reality Axis (`pragmatism`/`fantasy`) suggests that the epistemological foundation of a speaker's rhetoric—whether it acknowledges or denies complexity—is a primary predictor of its overall civic character.

Furthermore, the concept of `Tension` introduces a measurable dimension of strategic incoherence. This allows for a more nuanced analysis than a simple good/bad binary, identifying speakers who may advocate for virtuous ends (e.g., justice) using pathological means (e.g., resentment, manipulation). This aligns with critiques of populism that note its tendency to co-opt the language of justice while relying on divisive and simplistic frames.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The data allows for the identification of several distinct rhetorical archetypes, which may serve as a useful taxonomy for future research:
1.  **The Virtuous Statesman (McCain, Romney):** Characterized by a high CCI, very low tension, and a reliance on `dignity`, `truth`, and `pragmatism`. Their rhetoric is unifying and grounded in acknowledged reality. McCain's concession speech, with its explicit praise for his opponent and call for unity, is the exemplar. As John McCain stated: `"This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight."` (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`).
2.  **The Principled Advocate (Booker, Lewis):** Possesses a high CCI but with slightly more tension and higher scores on the Justice/Resentment axis. This archetype champions virtuous causes but may employ more confrontational or grievance-oriented language to do so, reflecting an activist stance.
3.  **The Ambivalent Populist (Ocasio-Cortez):** Occupies the center of the CCI spectrum, with a near-zero score and moderate tension. This archetype's rhetoric is a complex mix of high-minded virtue (`justice`, `hope`) and divisive vice (`tribalism`, `resentment`), making their overall civic character difficult to classify.
4.  **The Vice-Driven Antagonist (King, Sanders, Vance):** Defined by a negative CCI and high scores in `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `manipulation`/`fantasy`. This archetype's strategy is fundamentally divisive and often relies on simplifying complex problems into narratives of blame and grievance. The textual evidence for Sanders' high `tribalism` score illustrates this approach. As Bernie Sanders stated: `"I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%."` (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`).

### Limitations and Future Directions

The conclusions of this report must be tempered by its significant limitations, primarily the small and potentially unrepresentative sample (N=8). These findings should be treated as hypotheses generated by a pilot study, not as confirmed facts about the broader political landscape.

Future research should proceed in several directions:
*   **Scale:** Apply the CAF to a large-scale, longitudinal corpus of political texts to track the evolution of civic discourse over time and validate these archetypes across a wider range of speakers.
*   **Metadata Enrichment:** Utilize a corpus with rich metadata (party, ideology, speech context, rhetorical style) to perform more robust validation and test specific hypotheses, such as whether populist-styled speeches consistently score lower on the CCI.
*   **Cross-Cultural Analysis:** Deploy the framework on corpora from different political systems and cultures to assess the universality of these rhetorical patterns and axes.
*   **Refinement of Tension Metrics:** Further investigate the `Tension Indices` to understand the specific conditions under which speakers deploy contradictory frames and the persuasive effects of such strategies.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, despite its limited scope, successfully demonstrates the utility of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 for the quantitative study of civic character in political discourse. The study introduced and tested a set of novel derived metrics—most notably the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) and the Character Tension Indices—which proved effective at capturing both the overall moral valence and the strategic complexity of rhetoric.

The framework's internal consistency was strongly supported by a correlation analysis, which validated its oppositional design and revealed coherent, competing rhetorical meta-strategies. The analysis successfully moved beyond simple dimensional scores to identify distinct speaker archetypes and provide a data-driven map of the civic landscape within the corpus. While all findings remain preliminary, this research provides a robust proof-of-concept for a new method of inquiry in computational social science. It suggests that with larger corpora and richer metadata, the CAF can become a powerful tool for scholars, journalists, and citizens seeking to understand and evaluate the health of their public discourse.
