Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, that the Bidens\u2019 conduct justified the president\u2019s actions; and third, that the judgment of the president\u2019s actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president\u2019s counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father\u2019s name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president\u2019s counsel that a crime had been committed, the president\u2019s insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There\u2019s no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution\u2019s requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders\u2019 decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president\u2019s purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one\u2019s oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I\u2019ve received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \u201cstand with the team.\u201d I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history\u2019s rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI\u2019m aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I\u2019m sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus relieve from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I\u2019m convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We\u2019ve come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president\u2019s lawyers have implied. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong \u2014 grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n```\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\nI will go through each dimension from my assumed framework and apply it to the document.\n\n**Document ID:** `9ebec73f`\n**Document Name:** `mitt_romney_2020_impeachment_9ebec73f.txt`\n\n### Dimensions & Scoring:\n\n**Foundational Principles**\n\n*   **Constitutionalism**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The speech heavily emphasizes the Constitution. Romney explicitly states, \"The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success,\" and refers to \"the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses.\" He argues against the defense that there's no impeachment without a statutory crime by appealing to the \"historic meaning of the words 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' the writings of the founders.\" He also refutes the argument to leave the decision to voters by pointing out it's \"inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president.\" He frames his verdict as being \"under our Constitution.\"\n    *   **Raw Score**: 0.9\n    *   **Salience**: 0.9 (Explicitly and repeatedly invoked as the guiding principle for his decision)\n    *   **Confidence**: 1.0\n    *   **Evidence**:\n        *   \"The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it.\"\n        *   \"While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution\u2019s requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president.\"\n\n*   **CivicDuty**:\n    *   **Analysis**: Romney presents his decision as a fulfillment of his duty as a senator-juror. He mentions \"faithfully execute our responsibilities,\" \"swear an oath before God to exercise impartial justice,\" and putting \"personal feelings and political biases aside.\" He frames his vote as an \"act of conviction\" and states he will tell his children he \"did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\" He also mentions that \"The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\"\n    *   **Raw Score**: 0.9\n    *   **Salience**: 0.9 (It's the core justification for his potentially unpopular decision)\n    *   **Confidence**: 1.0\n    *   **Evidence**:\n        *   \"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.\"\n        *   \"But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\"\n        *   \"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\"\n\n*   **MoralityEthics**:\n    *   **Analysis**: Romney explicitly states, \"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\" He distinguishes actions that are \"not a crime\" but \"surely very wrong,\" implying a moral judgment beyond legal definitions. He describes the president's actions as \"an appalling abuse of public trust\" and \"grievously wrong.\" He fears ignoring evidence would \"expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\" The decision is framed as an \"inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me.\"\n    *   **Raw Score**: 0.8\n    *   **Salience**: 0.8 (It's a foundational element of his personal justification and framing of the president's actions)\n    *   **Confidence**: 1.0\n    *   **Evidence**:\n        *   \"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\"\n        *   \"While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\"\n        *   \"Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history\u2019s rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\"\n\n**Political Strategy & Framing**\n\n*   **Partisanship**:\n    *   **Analysis**: Romney directly addresses partisanship, acknowledging the pressure to \"stand with the team\" and the difficulty of judging \"the leader of my own party.\" He anticipates \"vehemently denounced\" from \"people in my party and in my state\" and \"abuse from the president and his supporters.\" He explicitly states that his oath required him to put \"political biases aside\" for \"impartial justice\" and that he refused to act \"for the sake of a partisan end.\" He also discusses Hamilton's intent to minimize \"partisan sentiments.\" This dimension is present, but framed negatively, as something he *resisted*.\n    *   **Raw Score**: 0.6 (Present, but as something to overcome, not endorse)\n    *   **Salience**: 0.7 (Discussed extensively as a challenge he had to overcome, highlighting its presence in the broader context)\n    *   **Confidence**: 1.0\n    *   **Evidence**:\n        *   \"I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\"\n        *   \"Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history\u2019s rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\"\n        *   \"I\u2019m aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced.\"\n\n*   **Bipartisanship**:\n    *   **Analysis**: While he acknowledges different judgments and hopes for respect (\"I hope we respect each other's good faith\"), the speech is fundamentally about his individual, minority decision against his own party. There's no call for bipartisan cooperation or bridging divides in his specific action or argument. The speech is about personal conviction and adherence to an oath despite partisan pressure.\n    *   **Raw Score**: 0.1 (Very low, only a fleeting mention of respecting differing judgments, not an active call for working together)\n    *   **Salience**: 0.1\n    *   **Confidence**: 0.9\n    *   **Evidence**:\n        *   \"We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\" (This is the only line hinting at this, and it's weak.)\n\n*   **Accountability**:\n    *   **Analysis**: The entire speech is an act of holding the president accountable through impeachment. He explicitly states his belief that the president is \"guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust\" and committed acts that \"would demand removal from office.\" He frames his vote as rendering a verdict on the president's actions.\n    *   **Raw Score**: 0.9\n    *   **Salience**: 0.9 (The central action and purpose of the speech is to explain his vote to hold the president accountable)\n    *   **Confidence**: 1.0\n    *   **Evidence**:\n        *   \"The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\"\n        *   \"Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\"\n\n*   **NationalInterest**:\n    *   **Analysis**: Romney frames the president's actions as a \"flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.\" He explicitly links his duty to the country's expectations (\"believing that my country expected it of me\") and speaks of his love for \"our country.\" He believes \"freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character.\" He also criticizes the president for delaying funds for an \"American ally at war with Russian invaders.\"\n    *   **Raw Score**: 0.8\n    *   **Salience**: 0.8 (Key justification for his vote, framing the president's actions as harmful to the nation)\n    *   **Confidence**: 1.0\n    *   **Evidence**:\n        *   \"What he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.\"\n        *   \"I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I\u2019m convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character.\"\n\n*   **RhetoricalAppeals**:\n    *   **Analysis**:\n        *   **Ethos (Credibility/Character)**: Strong throughout. He establishes his religious conviction and oath-taking seriousness (\"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\"). He highlights the personal difficulty of his decision (\"the most difficult decision I have ever faced\") and his willingness to face political backlash, positioning himself as principled. He mentions his 80% voting record with the president to show he's not generally opposed.\n        *   **Pathos (Emotion)**: Appeals to patriotism (\"I love our country\"), personal sacrifice (\"put my personal feelings and political biases aside\"), and the judgment of future generations (\"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty\"). He evokes a sense of moral rectitude and conscience.\n        *   **Logos (Logic/Reason)**: Systematically addresses and refutes the president's defenses (no statutory crime, Biden conduct, leave to voters) using constitutional arguments, historical meaning, and reasoned judgment. He presents the evidence for the president's actions clearly.\n    *   **Raw Score**: 0.9 (All three appeals are strongly and effectively used)\n    *   **Salience**: 0.9 (The speech is a masterclass in persuasive rhetoric, particularly ethos and logos, to justify a controversial stand)\n    *   **Confidence**: 1.0\n    *   **Evidence**:\n        *   \"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\" (Ethos/Pathos)\n        *   \"The historic meaning of the words 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal.\" (Logos)\n        *   \"What he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.\" (Pathos)\n\n**Consequences & Impact**\n\n*   **FutureImplications**:\n    *   **Analysis**: Romney repeatedly refers to future consequences and the judgment of history. He fears his character being exposed \"to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\" He wants to be able to tell his children and grandchildren that he did his duty. He states, \"I will only be one name among many... to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial.\" He also frames the president's actions as \"corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one\u2019s oath of office that I can imagine,\" implying long-term damage.\n    *   **Raw Score**: 0.8\n    *   **Salience**: 0.7 (It's a significant motivator for his action, framing it beyond immediate political gain)\n    *   **Confidence**: 1.0\n    *   **Evidence**:\n        *   \"Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history\u2019s rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\"\n        *   \"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\"\n\n*   **PublicOpinion**:\n    *   **Analysis**: Romney explicitly discusses public opinion and its role. He addresses the argument that the decision should be left to voters, refuting it constitutionally but acknowledging that \"Voters will make the final decision.\" He anticipates disapproval and abuse from \"people in my party and in my state\" and \"the president and his supporters.\" He also mentions receiving \"numerous calls and texts\" demanding he \"stand with the team.\" He concludes by stating that the Senate's verdict will be appealed to \"the judgment of the American people.\"\n    *   **Raw Score**: 0.7\n    *   **Salience**: 0.7 (It's discussed as a significant external pressure and ultimate arbiter, even if not the immediate one)\n    *   **Confidence**: 1.0\n    *   **Evidence**:\n        *   \"The defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution\u2019s requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president.\"\n        *   \"I\u2019m aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced.
