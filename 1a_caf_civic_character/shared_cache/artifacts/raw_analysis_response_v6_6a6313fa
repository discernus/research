    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the provided text, which is a powerful and historically significant speech from the Civil Rights Movement. The speaker, John Lewis, employs strong rhetoric characterized by a combination of grievance (Resentment), calls for systemic fairness (Justice), descriptions of threats (Fear), and an aspirational vision (Hope). The framework's ability to score opposing dimensions simultaneously is crucial for capturing the speech's complexity, where both the problems (Resentment, Fear) and the proposed solutions (Justice, Hope) are given high rhetorical prominence."
