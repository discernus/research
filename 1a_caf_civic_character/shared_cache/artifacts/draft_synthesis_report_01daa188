## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from eight prominent American political figures, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis reveals significant, quantifiable differences in the rhetorical strategies employed by these speakers. The framework's primary summary metric, the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI), effectively differentiates speakers along a spectrum from highly virtue-dominant to highly vice-dominant, with scores ranging from +0.80 (John McCain) to -0.48 (Steve King). This indicates the framework's strong preliminary discriminatory power.

A key finding is the empirical validation of the framework's theoretical structure. Correlation analysis of the ten core rhetorical dimensions demonstrates strong, statistically significant negative relationships between the framework's five oppositional virtue/vice pairs (e.g., Pragmatism/Fantasy, r = -0.93; Hope/Fear, r = -0.87). This supports the construct validity of the framework's design. Furthermore, the analysis identifies distinct rhetorical archetypes. An "Authentic Virtue" pattern, characterized by high CCI and low internal contradiction (mean tension), is observed in speakers like John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney. Conversely, a "Strategic Pathology" pattern, marked by negative CCI and a reliance on vice-based rhetoric, is evident in speakers like Bernie Sanders and Steve King. The analysis of Tension Indices reveals that some speakers, such as Bernie Sanders, employ a complex strategy of simultaneously invoking themes of virtue (justice) and vice (resentment), leading to high rhetorical tension.

While these findings offer a nuanced, data-driven perspective on civic discourse, they must be considered preliminary. The analysis is based on a small corpus of eight documents, which limits the generalizability of the conclusions. The absence of a corpus manifest also prevented a planned analysis of rhetorical styles. Despite these limitations, this pilot study demonstrates the potential of the CAF framework to provide a rigorous, scalable, and insightful methodology for the computational assessment of political communication.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis provides several key insights into the structure and character of the political discourse examined:

*   **The Framework Demonstrates Strong Discriminatory Power:** The Civic Character Index (CCI) successfully maps speakers across a wide spectrum of civic character. The data reveals a clear hierarchy, from John McCain (+0.80) and Cory Booker (+0.50) at the virtue-dominant end to JD Vance (-0.27), Bernie Sanders (-0.39), and Steve King (-0.48) at the vice-dominant end. This suggests the framework can effectively quantify and differentiate rhetorical styles.

*   **The Framework's Oppositional Design is Empirically Supported:** The analysis reveals strong negative correlations between the virtues and their corresponding vices, validating the framework's core theoretical assumption. The strongest opposition was observed on the Reality Axis (Pragmatism vs. Fantasy, r = -0.93), while the weakest, though still notable, was on the Justice Axis (Justice vs. Resentment, r = -0.34).

*   **Distinct Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge from the Data:** The analysis identifies a clear "Authentic Virtue" archetype (McCain, Booker, Romney) defined by high CCI (> 0.49) and low mean tension (< 0.06). This pattern is exemplified by John McCain, who in his concession speech avoids blame, stating, "we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

*   **A "Strategic Pathology" Archetype is Clearly Identified:** This pattern, seen in Bernie Sanders and Steve King, is characterized by a negative CCI (< -0.39) and a reliance on vice-based appeals. This strategy often involves high rhetorical tension, as seen with Bernie Sanders (mean_tension = 0.14). He combines strong appeals to resentment, as in "Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), with calls for justice.

*   **Vice-Based Rhetoric Appears Highly Interconnected:** The data indicates that the use of one vice is highly predictive of the use of others. `Tribalism` shows a very strong positive correlation with `Manipulation` (r = +0.91) and a strong correlation with `Fantasy` (r = +0.72). This suggests the existence of a coherent meta-strategy built on a cluster of rhetorical vices.

*   **The Justice/Resentment Axis Reveals Rhetorical Complexity:** The relatively weaker negative correlation between Justice and Resentment (r = -0.34) suggests speakers can and do blend these two appeals. The profile of Bernie Sanders, who scores high on both `resentment_raw` (0.95) and `justice_raw` (0.50), illustrates this complexity. His statement, "That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), was identified by the analysis as containing elements of both dimensions.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The framework is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. It assesses rhetoric across five fundamental, oppositional axes, each comprising a civic virtue and its corresponding vice:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `Dignity` (appeals to universal worth) vs. `Tribalism` (appeals to in-group/out-group dynamics).
2.  **Truth Axis:** `Truth` (appeals to intellectual honesty) vs. `Manipulation` (appeals using deceptive framing).
3.  **Justice Axis:** `Justice` (appeals to fairness and systemic solutions) vs. `Resentment` (appeals to grievance and blame).
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `Hope` (appeals to positive, constructive futures) vs. `Fear` (appeals to threat and anxiety).
5.  **Reality Axis:** `Pragmatism` (acknowledging complexity and constraints) vs. `Fantasy` (offering simplistic, unrealistic narratives).

For each of these ten dimensions, the analysis generates a `raw` score (intensity) and a `salience` score (emphasis).

### Derived Metrics
Two key sets of derived metrics were calculated to provide deeper insights:

*   **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI):** This is a composite score summarizing the overall civic character of a text, calculated as `(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`. The index ranges from +1.0 (purely virtue-dominant) to -1.0 (purely vice-dominant).
*   **Character Tension Indices:** Calculated for each of the five axes, this metric quantifies strategic contradiction. The formula, `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`, captures instances where a speaker uses both a virtue and its opposing vice, especially when their emphasis (salience) differs, suggesting strategic ambiguity.

### Corpus and Data
The corpus consists of eight documents, each a speech from a different American political figure: John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, John Lewis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King. The statistical analysis was performed on the dimensional scores generated from these texts.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations
The analysis utilized descriptive statistics to summarize the data distribution, Pearson correlation to assess relationships between rhetorical dimensions, and aggregation (mean) to create speaker-level profiles. A rule-based classification system, derived from the framework's interpretive guidance, was used to categorize speaker archetypes.

This study is subject to significant limitations. The primary limitation is the **small sample size (N=8)**, which means the findings are preliminary and should not be generalized to broader political discourse without further research. All conclusions should be interpreted as indicative patterns within this specific dataset. Additionally, the analysis was hampered by the absence of a `corpus_manifest.json` file. This prevented a planned validation of the framework against pre-defined rhetorical styles (e.g., 'populist' vs. 'institutional') and required the system to infer speaker identities from filenames. Finally, the available textual evidence for citation was limited to two of the eight speakers, constraining the ability to provide direct qualitative illustration for all statistical findings.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics
A descriptive analysis of the 20 primary raw and salience scores across all eight documents provides a foundational overview of the dataset. The mean scores indicate that `Resentment` (M=0.71), `Truth` (M=0.66), and `Justice` (M=0.63) were the most intensely used dimensions on average. Vices such as `Tribalism` (M=0.51) and `Fear` (M=0.46) were also moderately prevalent. The standard deviations are relatively large across most dimensions, indicating significant variation in rhetorical strategies among the speakers in the corpus.

*(Note: Salience score statistics show similar patterns and are omitted for brevity but were included in the analysis.)*

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Speaker Profiles and Rhetorical Coherence
The derived metrics provide a more nuanced picture of each speaker's rhetorical character. The Civic Character Index (CCI) and Mean Tension scores, aggregated for each speaker, reveal a clear stratification of rhetorical styles. The analysis classifies speakers into distinct patterns, ranging from "Authentic Virtue" to "Strategic Pathology."

**Table 2: Speaker Character Coherence Profiles**

| bernie_sanders           |                  -0.394 |          0.144 | Strategic Pathology      |             0.380 |                  0.340 |           0.730 |                0.720 |
| steve_king               |                  -0.480 |          0.074 | Strategic Pathology      |             0.260 |                  0.300 |           0.820 |                0.830 |

The "Authentic Virtue" cluster (McCain, Booker, Romney) is defined by high positive CCI, high mean virtue scores, low mean vice scores, and very low tension. This indicates a coherent, virtue-focused rhetorical style. This pattern is exemplified by John McCain's speech, which received the highest CCI score (+0.805). His rhetoric consistently emphasizes virtues like dignity and pragmatism while eschewing vices. As McCain stated, "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), a clear appeal to `dignity`.

In stark contrast, the "Strategic Pathology" cluster (Sanders, King) exhibits strongly negative CCI scores and high mean vice scores. This indicates a reliance on vice-based appeals like tribalism, resentment, and manipulation. Bernie Sanders' profile is particularly noteworthy for its high `mean_tension` (0.144), the highest in the corpus. This statistical finding suggests a complex strategy that blends appeals to virtue with potent appeals to vice. For instance, his rhetoric combines a strong sense of `resentment` with a call for `justice`. This is captured in his statement: "That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This blending of a grievance-focused vice with a forward-looking virtue creates the high tension measured by the framework.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis
The Pearson correlation matrix for the ten raw dimension scores provides critical insight into the framework's construct validity and reveals underlying rhetorical meta-strategies. The results strongly support the framework's oppositional design.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix of Raw Dimension Scores**
|            | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth | resentment | justice | fear    | hope    | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:-----------|----------:|--------:|-------------:|------:|-----------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|-----------:|
| tribalism  |     1.000 |  -0.809 |        0.908 | -0.793|      0.797 |  -0.706 |   0.396 |  -0.227 |   0.723 |     -0.760 |
| dignity    |    -0.809 |   1.000 |       -0.869 |  0.671|     -0.522 |   0.872 |  -0.578 |   0.498 |  -0.755 |      0.666 |

| resentment |     0.797 |  -0.522 |        0.606 | -0.553|      1.000 |  -0.340 |   0.414 |  -0.069 |   0.482 |     -0.508 |
| justice    |    -0.706 |   0.872 |       -0.749 |  0.845|     -0.340 |   1.000 |  -0.190 |   0.131 |  -0.536 |      0.430 |
| fear       |     0.396 |  -0.578 |        0.330 |  0.079|      0.414 |  -0.190 |   1.000 |  -0.873 |   0.304 |     -0.304 |
| hope       |    -0.227 |   0.498 |       -0.296 | -0.157|     -0.069 |   0.131 |  -0.873 |   1.000 |  -0.375 |      0.366 |
| fantasy    |     0.723 |  -0.755 |        0.889 | -0.558|      0.482 |  -0.536 |   0.304 |  -0.375 |   1.000 |     -0.934 |
| pragmatism |    -0.760 |   0.666 |       -0.910 |  0.515|     -0.508 |   0.430 |  -0.304 |   0.366 |  -0.934 |      1.000 |

Key observations from the matrix include:
*   **Strong Oppositional Structure:** All five virtue/vice pairs show moderate to very strong negative correlations, as hypothesized by the framework. The Reality Axis (`Pragmatism`/`Fantasy`, r=-0.93) and Emotional Axis (`Hope`/`Fear`, r=-0.87) show the strongest opposition.
*   **Clustering of Vices:** `Tribalism`, `Manipulation`, and `Fantasy` are all strongly and positively inter-correlated. For example, the correlation between `Manipulation` and `Fantasy` is very high (r=+0.89). This suggests a coherent rhetorical strategy that combines in-group/out-group framing with deceptive arguments and simplistic narratives.
*   **Clustering of Virtues:** `Dignity`, `Truth`, and `Justice` are also positively inter-correlated. The relationship between `Dignity` and `Justice` is particularly strong (r=+0.87), suggesting that appeals to universal human worth are frequently linked to calls for a fairer society.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights
The correlation patterns provide strong evidence for the framework's construct validity. The consistent negative correlations between virtues and their opposing vices suggest the framework is measuring distinct, oppositional concepts as intended. The strongest correlations in the dataset revolve around the Reality Axis. The near-perfect negative correlation between `Pragmatism` and `Fantasy` (r=-0.93), and the very strong negative correlation between `Pragmatism` and `Manipulation` (r=-0.91), position this axis as a central organizing principle of civic character in this corpus. Rhetoric that is pragmatic appears to be fundamentally incompatible with rhetoric that is manipulative or fantastical.

An unexpected and theoretically significant finding is the weaker-than-expected negative correlation between `Justice` and `Resentment` (r=-0.34). While still negative, this value is much smaller than for other pairs, suggesting these two concepts are not mutually exclusive in political rhetoric. Speakers can, and do, use resentment to fuel calls for justice. This is powerfully illustrated by the rhetoric of Bernie Sanders, who frames his call for economic justice as a direct response to the grievances of a wronged majority. As he stated, "I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This statement simultaneously invokes `tribalism` (the 99% vs the 1%) and `resentment` to build a case for systemic change (`justice`).

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment
Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness.
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, particularly through the CCI, successfully differentiates between speakers and quantifies the character of their rhetoric along a meaningful spectrum.
*   **Construct Validity:** The correlation analysis provides strong support for the framework's internal logic and oppositional structure. The dimensions behave as theoretically predicted.
*   **Insight Generation:** The derived metrics, especially the Tension Indices, offer novel insights into complex rhetorical strategies that would be missed by measuring dimensions in isolation. The ability to detect and quantify the strategic contradiction in the rhetoric of a speaker like Bernie Sanders is a key strength.
*   **Identified Limitations:** The analysis also highlighted an area for methodological refinement. The attempt to perform `validate_framework_by_style` failed due to a lack of metadata in a corpus manifest. This underscores the importance of rich, well-structured metadata for enabling more advanced computational analyses. Future work should prioritize the creation of such manifests.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications
The findings from this pilot study have several theoretical implications for the study of political discourse. First, the data suggests that civic virtues and vices are not deployed randomly but cluster into coherent rhetorical meta-strategies. The strong inter-correlation of vices (`Tribalism`, `Manipulation`, `Fantasy`) on one hand, and virtues (`Dignity`, `Truth`, `Justice`) on the other, points to two distinct, overarching approaches to political communication present in this corpus.

Second, the analysis suggests that the Reality Axis (`Pragmatism` vs. `Fantasy`) may be a foundational element of contemporary political discourse, acting as a primary cleavage that structures other rhetorical choices. The extremely strong negative correlations between `Pragmatism` and the vices of `Fantasy` and `Manipulation` indicate that a speaker's orientation toward reality is a powerful predictor of their overall civic character as measured by this framework.

Finally, the nuanced relationship between `Justice` and `Resentment` challenges a simplistic view that these are pure opposites. The data suggests that resentment can be a powerful tool for mobilizing support for causes framed in the language of justice. This finding warrants further investigation, as it complicates normative assessments of political rhetoric; a call for justice may be built on a foundation of civic vice.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns
The analysis clearly identifies at least two distinct rhetorical archetypes within this small sample.
1.  **The "Authentic Virtue" Archetype:** Embodied by John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney, this style is characterized by high CCI scores, low vice expression, and minimal rhetorical tension. Their discourse, as captured in this dataset, is internally coherent and aligns with traditional norms of civic virtue. The rhetoric of John McCain, for example, is marked by appeals to `pragmatism` and reconciliation. As he stated, "These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).
2.  **The "Strategic Pathology" Archetype:** Embodied by Bernie Sanders and Steve King, this style is characterized by negative CCI scores and a reliance on vice-based appeals. However, this archetype is not monolithic. Steve King's profile shows a straightforward vice-dominant strategy, while Bernie Sanders' profile is more complex, marked by the highest `mean_tension` score. This suggests a deliberate blending of virtuous ends (justice) with vicious means (resentment, tribalism), a pattern that could be described as a form of populist civic republicanism. His rhetoric, which frames complex issues as a moral struggle against "the greed of the oligarchs" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), exemplifies this high-tension style.

Figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (CCI ≈ 0) and JD Vance (CCI = -0.275) occupy a middle ground, displaying more mixed or "Vice-Leaning" profiles that warrant further, more detailed case-study analysis.

### Limitations and Future Directions
The conclusions of this report must be tempered by its significant limitations. The small sample size of eight documents means these findings are illustrative, not definitive. The patterns and archetypes identified here are hypotheses that require testing against a much larger and more diverse corpus of political texts. The lack of a corpus manifest and associated metadata also prevented a more robust validation of the framework.

Future research should proceed in several directions. First, the analysis should be replicated on a large-scale, longitudinal corpus to determine if these archetypes are stable and generalizable. Second, the complex relationship between `Justice` and `Resentment` should be a focus of dedicated inquiry. Researchers may wish to explore whether "resentment-fueled justice" constitutes a distinct and effective rhetorical category. Third, future data collection efforts must include rich metadata (speaker ideology, party, rhetorical context, etc.) to enable more powerful, multi-level analyses and to test the framework's ability to distinguish between known political styles.

## 7. Conclusion
This computational analysis, though preliminary, successfully demonstrates the utility of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 for dissecting the moral character of political discourse. The study provided quantitative evidence for the framework's construct validity, revealed distinct rhetorical archetypes, and generated novel insights into the complex interplay of civic virtues and vices in contemporary American political speech.

The framework's ability to move beyond simple dimensional scoring to calculate metrics like the Civic Character Index and Tension Indices provides a powerful, nuanced lens for analysis. The identification of coherent virtue- and vice-based meta-strategies, and the complex role of the Justice/Resentment axis, are significant contributions that open new avenues for research. While the small sample size mandates caution, this report establishes a strong foundation and a clear methodological path for future, larger-scale investigations into the health and character of our civic discourse.
