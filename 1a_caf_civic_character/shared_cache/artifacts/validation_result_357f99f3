    "The experiment's expected outcome includes 'ANOVA results demonstrating significant differences between speakers', but the corpus only contains 8 documents. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) performed on a sample size of N=8 lacks sufficient statistical power to yield reliable or meaningful results.",
    "The formula for the Character Tension Indices is 'min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)'. This formula calculates tension as highest when the salience of opposing dimensions is most different, which measures 'salience imbalance' rather than 'strategic contradiction'. True strategic tension occurs when a speaker attempts to appeal to two opposing ideas with high intensity and high salience simultaneously."
