## Executive Summary

This report details the results of an experiment designed to test the Civic Analysis Framework's (CAF) ability to identify distinct character patterns in political discourse. The analysis focused on a corpus of eight documents, each from a different speaker.

Key findings indicate that the framework's dimensional structure is internally coherent. Strong correlations were observed between theoretically related virtues and pathologies, such as a negative correlation between Dignity and Tribalism (r=-0.93) and a positive correlation between Tribalism and Resentment (r=0.93). This suggests that the framework successfully captures coherent character signatures. Furthermore, analysis of the Civic Character Index (CCI) revealed a wide distribution of scores across the corpus (min: 0.135, max: 0.895), demonstrating the framework's capacity to measure meaningful variation in character coherence.

A primary limitation of this study is the corpus design, which includes only one document per speaker. This sample size precludes statistical testing (e.g., ANOVA) required to validate the hypothesis that the framework can differentiate between speakers with statistical significance.

## Collaborator Section

### Claim 1: Speaker Differentiation

**Hypothesis:** The 10 CAF dimensions will show statistically significant differences between speakers [1].

This hypothesis is not testable with the current data. The rationale provided states that statistical tests for significant differences, such as ANOVA, are not valid with only one observation per speaker in the corpus [1]. Descriptive statistics show variation across the dimensions, but significance cannot be determined.

- "The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly." [2]
- "I imagine that many of them are very good people." [3]

### Claim 2: Virtue-Pathology Correlation

**Hypothesis:** Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices [4].

The data supports the existence of coherent character signatures by demonstrating strong negative correlations between opposing virtues and pathologies. The Pearson correlation between Dignity and Tribalism scores across the corpus is -0.93, indicating that as appeals to universal dignity increase, appeals to group-based tribalism tend to decrease [4]. This oppositional relationship is a foundational component of the character signatures measured by the framework.

- "Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect." [5]
- "Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect." [6]

### Claim 3: Inter-Construct Coherence

**Hypothesis:** Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices [7].

The analysis reveals strong positive correlations among conceptually related dimensions, suggesting that character signatures are internally coherent. For example, a strong positive correlation exists between Dignity and Pragmatism (r=0.88) and between Tribalism and Resentment (r=0.93) [7]. This indicates that appeals to one virtue or pathology are predictive of appeals to others within the same category.

- "I imagine that many of them are very good people." [8]
- "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [9]
- "I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced." [10]

### Claim 4: Reality Axis Polarity

**Hypothesis:** Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices [11].

The Reality Axis (Pragmatism vs. Fantasy) and its relationship with the Truth Axis represent a powerful structural element within the observed character signatures. The correlation analysis shows a near-perfect negative correlation between Pragmatism and Fantasy (r=-0.98) and between Truth and Fantasy (r=-0.97) [11]. This suggests a fundamental opposition in discourse styles captured by the framework.

- "Mass media and Fox News, and the right will have you believe that these American values are something out of the Communist Manifesto." [12]
- "We want our freedom and we want it now!" [13]
- "We are a nation that believes in redemption." [14]

### Claim 5: Civic Character Index Variation

**Hypothesis:** MC-SCI scores will vary meaningfully between speakers, indicating different levels of character coherence [15].

The Civic Character Index (CCI) demonstrates substantial variation across the speaker sample. The scores ranged from a minimum of 0.135 to a maximum of 0.895, with a standard deviation of 0.295 [15]. This wide range supports the premise that character coherence, as measured by the CCI, varies meaningfully across the analyzed texts.

- "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [9]
- "American leaders should look out for Americans. And by the way, I know for the Brits here, UK leaders should look out for citizens of the UK, or subjects, or whatever you guys call yourselves, and so on and on for other, other citizens of other countries." [16]

### Claim 6: Salience Weighting Effect

**Hypothesis:** MC-SCI scores will vary meaningfully between speakers, indicating different levels of character coherence [17].

A comparison between the standard Civic Character Index and the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index was conducted to assess the impact of weighting scores by their centrality to the message. The analysis found a minimal difference between the mean of the standard CCI (0.514) and the mean of the Salience-Weighted Index (0.528) [17]. This suggests that for this specific corpus, weighting by salience did not substantially alter the overall character coherence assessment.

- "We must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote." [18]
- "American leaders should look out for Americans. And by the way, I know for the Brits here, UK leaders should look out for citizens of the UK, or subjects, or whatever you guys call yourselves, and so on and on for other, other citizens of other countries." [16]
- "I want to see law enforcement. And I want an expectation that when the law is broken in the United States, that there's going to be an enforcement, that it'll be applied equally without regard to any of these categories that the President encourages us to be members of." [19]

## Technical Transparency

-   **Limitations:** The hypothesis regarding statistically significant differentiation between speakers could not be tested. The corpus design, with a single document per speaker (n=1), makes statistical tests like ANOVA invalid for this purpose.
