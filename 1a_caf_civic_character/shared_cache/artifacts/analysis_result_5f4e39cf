The speech is characterized by a strong appeal to the virtue-based dimensions (Dignity, Justice, Hope, Truth, Pragmatism) and a critique of the system through the lens of vice-based dimensions (especially Resentment). The salience scores reflect the centrality of the Justice/Resentment axis to the speech's overall argument. Dimensions like Manipulation and Fantasy were scored as absent as the speaker takes an evidence-based and pragmatic approach, explicitly framing the bill as a 'first step' and not a complete solution.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"cory_booker_2018_first_step_act_0c32812a.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribalism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.2,\n          \"salience\": 0.3,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"manipulation\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"truth\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"resentment\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"justice\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 1.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.98\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.2,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"fantasy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"pragmatism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribalism\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"context_type\": \"critique_of_systemic_bias\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"dignity\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"We as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"appeal_to_shared_humanity\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"manipulation\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"no_evidence_found\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"truth\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"Since 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"statistical_argument\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"resentment\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"We now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850.
