The Experiment Specification v10.0 states that for a sample size of N=4-9, analysis should be limited to 'Case study analysis, qualitative patterns, individual document insights', and that hypothesis testing like ANOVA is inappropriate.",
      "impact": "The experiment will be blocked from execution as the requested statistical analysis is invalid for the provided sample size, violating the platform's statistical power and methodology requirements. Any inferential results would be statistically meaningless.",
      "fix": "Revise the 'Expected Outcomes' in experiment.md to align with the sample size. Instead of 'ANOVA results', specify 'Descriptive statistics', 'Comparative case study analysis', or 'Qualitative pattern analysis'. Alternatively, expand the corpus to meet the minimum sample size for the desired statistical tests (N>10 for descriptive statistics, N>20 for limited inferential testing).",

      "description": "The experiment's expected outcomes rely on comparing 'institutional' and 'populist' speakers, but this grouping is not explicitly defined. The corpus manifest provides more granular 'style' metadata (e.g., 'institutional_progressive', 'populist_conservative'). Experiment Specification v10.0 requires such derived groupings to be explicitly defined via a mapping.",
      "impact": "The analysis cannot proceed because the system cannot determine which documents belong to the 'institutional' and 'populist' groups for comparison. The platform is forbidden from inferring groupings from prose descriptions or partial metadata matches.",
      "fix": "In experiment.md, add a 'Data Grouping and Custom Variable Mapping' section that explicitly maps the 'style' values from the corpus manifest to the desired analytical groups ('institutional', 'populist', 'civil_rights'). For example, map 'institutional' and 'institutional_progressive' to a new group called 'Institutional'.",
