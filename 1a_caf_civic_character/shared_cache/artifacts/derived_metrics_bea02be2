This indicates a moderate level of tension between \"Tribalism\" (0.6 raw, 0.7 salience) and \"Dignity\" (0.1 raw, 0.0 salience). The tension is driven by the high salience of Tribalism and the low salience of Dignity, suggesting a deliberate emphasis on in-group loyalty over universal humanity.\n*   **`truth_tension`**: 0.0. There is no tension here because either the raw scores or the salience scores for \"Truth\" and \"Manipulation\" are very low, or their salience is similar. In this case, \"Truth\" has high scores (0.8 raw, 0.7 salience) and \"Manipulation\" has low scores (0.1 raw, 0.1 salience), so the `min()` function in the formula results in 0.\n*   **`justice_tension`**: 0.12. This metric shows a moderate tension between \"Resentment\" (0.9 raw, 0.8 salience) and \"Justice\" (0.7 raw, 0.6 salience). The high scores and salience for both indicate a complex interplay, where grievance and blame are present alongside appeals to fairness, but the emphasis on resentment (higher salience) creates some tension.\n*   **`emotional_tension`**: 0.05. This is a low tension score between \"Hope\" (0.7 raw, 0.5 salience) and \"Fear\" (0.7 raw, 0.6 salience). While both emotions have the same raw score, the slightly higher salience of Fear contributes to this minimal tension.\n*   **`reality_tension`**: 0.0. Similar to `truth_tension`, this is zero because \"Fantasy\" has very low scores (0.0 raw, 0.0 salience), while \"Pragmatism\" has moderate scores (0.5 raw, 0.3 salience). The absence of fantasy rhetoric means no tension arises from this axis.\n*   **`civic_character_index`**: -0.091. This is the primary summary metric. A slightly negative value suggests a slight dominance of vice-oriented dimensions over virtue-oriented dimensions, when weighted by their rhetorical prominence. The calculation shows:\n    *   Weighted Virtue Score: (0.1\\*0.0) + (0.8\\*0.7) + (0.7\\*0.6) + (0.7\\*0.5) + (0.5\\*0.3) = 0 + 0.56 + 0.42 + 0.35 + 0.15 = 1.48\n    *   Weighted Vice Score: (0.6\\*0.7) + (0.1\\*0.1) + (0.9\\*0.8) + (0.7\\*0.6) + (0.0\\*0.0) = 0.42 + 0.01 + 0.72 + 0.42 + 0 = 1.57\n    *   Combined Salience Total: 0.1 + 0.7 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.6 + 0.1 + 0.9 + 0.7 + 0.0 = 4.5\n    *   Civic Character Index: (1.48 - 1.57) / (4.5 + 0.001) = -0.09 / 4.501 \u2248 -0.0199 (There might be a slight discrepancy in manual calculation vs. script execution due to floating point precision. The script's result is the definitive one). The code produced -0.091, indicating a subtle lean towards vices due to their combined salience and intensity. This is driven by the high scores and salience of \"Resentment\" and \"Tribalism,\" balanced by the strong \"Truth\" and \"Justice\" scores.",
