The document presents a strong, values-based argument for legislative reform, heavily utilizing themes of justice, dignity, truth, and hope, while framing the status quo through a lens of resentment towards systemic failures. The speaker's emphasis on bipartisan compromise and acknowledging the bill as a 'first step' demonstrates high pragmatism. Vice dimensions like manipulation and fantasy are largely absent, and tribalism is actively countered by appeals to universal values.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"cory_booker_2018_first_step_act_0c32812a.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribalism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.2,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"manipulation\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"truth\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"resentment\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"justice\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.3,\n          \"salience\": 0.3,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"fantasy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"pragmatism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribalism\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"context_type\": \"critique_of_division\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"dignity\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.
