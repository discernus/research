## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from a corpus of eight documents, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis reveals the framework's considerable capacity to differentiate rhetorical styles and quantify the moral character of political speech. The findings, while preliminary due to the small sample size (N=8), indicate that the CAF's dimensions cluster into coherent and oppositional meta-strategies of "virtue" and "vice," providing strong suggestive evidence for the framework's construct validity.

Key findings indicate a clear demarcation among the analyzed speakers. The derived **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)** effectively ranks speakers on a spectrum from highly virtuous (John McCain, CCI = +0.80) to strategically pathological (Steve King, CCI = -0.48). Correlation analysis reveals a strong negative relationship between virtuous dimensions (e.g., `pragmatism`, `dignity`) and vice-based dimensions (e.g., `fantasy`, `tribalism`, `manipulation`), with some correlations exceeding r = -0.90. This suggests that these rhetorical approaches are not only distinct but often mutually exclusive. Furthermore, the analysis of **Character Tension Indices** highlights speakers who strategically blend virtuous and pathological appeals, such as Bernie Sanders, whose discourse exhibits high tension between calls for justice and appeals to resentment.

Overall, this pilot analysis suggests that the CAF is an effective tool for moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to a more nuanced, theory-driven evaluation of political communication. It successfully quantifies abstract concepts from civic republicanism and virtue ethics, identifying distinct rhetorical archetypes and their underlying strategic logics. The results underscore the framework's potential for larger-scale studies, while the limitations of this small dataset highlight the need for future research with more extensive and varied corpora to confirm these initial patterns.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of eight political texts through the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 yielded several key insights into the structure of civic discourse:

*   **Rhetorical Strategies Form Coherent Clusters:** The ten core dimensions of the CAF are not used randomly. They form two oppositional clusters: a "virtue" cluster (`dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, `hope`, `pragmatism`) and a "vice" cluster (`tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, `fantasy`). The strong negative correlation between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93) exemplifies this structural opposition.
*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) Effectively Differentiates Speakers:** The composite CCI metric provides a powerful, high-level summary of a speaker's rhetorical posture. The analysis produced a wide and interpretable range of scores, from John McCain's highly virtuous CCI of +0.80 to Steve King's vice-dominant CCI of -0.48, suggesting the index has significant discriminatory power.
*   **"Authentic Virtue" is Characterized by Low Vice and Low Tension:** Speakers classified as demonstrating "Authentic Virtue," such as John McCain (Mean Tension = 0.01), exhibit consistently high scores in virtue dimensions and near-zero scores in vice dimensions. As McCain stated, taking personal responsibility rather than assigning blame: *"we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours."* (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`). This rhetorical profile is marked by its coherence and lack of strategic contradiction.
*   **"Strategic Pathology" Leverages High-Intensity Vice:** Speakers at the opposite end of the spectrum, like Bernie Sanders (Mean Vice Raw = 0.73) and Steve King (Mean Vice Raw = 0.82), are defined by the high intensity and salience of their vice-based appeals. This is evident in Sanders' use of `resentment`, as he stated: *"Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."* (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`).
*   **Rhetorical Tension Signals Strategic Ambiguity:** The analysis identifies "tension" as a key feature of certain rhetorical styles. Speakers like Bernie Sanders (Mean Tension = 0.14) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Mean Tension = 0.09) score high on this metric, indicating they simultaneously deploy conceptually opposed virtues and vices with significant intensity. This suggests a strategy of mobilizing audiences through grievance while also appealing to ideals of justice.
*   **The Framework Demonstrates Strong Oppositional Validity:** The core design of the CAF, which pairs virtues with corresponding vices, is strongly supported by the data. The consistent, large negative correlations between paired dimensions (e.g., `dignity` vs. `tribalism`, r = -0.81; `pragmatism` vs. `fantasy`, r = -0.93) suggest the framework is measuring genuinely oppositional constructs, a key indicator of its validity.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. Grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory, the CAF analyzes speech across five fundamental axes, each representing a tension between a civic virtue and its corresponding vice:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `dignity` (universal worth) vs. `tribalism` (in-group/out-group dynamics).
2.  **Truth Axis:** `truth` (intellectual honesty) vs. `manipulation` (deceptive framing).
3.  **Justice Axis:** `justice` (fairness, systemic solutions) vs. `resentment` (grievance, blame).
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `hope` (optimistic, constructive vision) vs. `fear` (threat-based motivation).
5.  **Reality Axis:** `pragmatism` (acknowledging complexity) vs. `fantasy` (oversimplification, denial of constraints).

For each of the 10 dimensions, the analysis generates a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1). From these, two types of derived metrics are calculated: five **Character Tension Indices** (e.g., `identity_tension`), which measure the degree of strategic contradiction on each axis, and a single **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, which provides a holistic measure of a text's orientation toward virtue or vice.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The corpus consists of eight distinct political speeches from eight different American political figures. The specific documents and speakers were identified from the filenames in the dataset. Due to the absence of a corpus manifest (`corpus.md not found`), metadata such as rhetorical style (e.g., 'populist', 'institutional') was unavailable, which precluded certain planned analyses. Each document was processed to yield scores for the 20 primary CAF metrics (10 raw, 10 salience) and associated confidence scores.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis proceeded through several stages:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all 20 primary metrics to understand the overall distribution of rhetorical features in the corpus.
2.  **Derived Metrics Calculation:** Application of the CAF v10.0 formulas to compute the five Tension Indices and the final CCI for each document. The CCI is calculated as `(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`.
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for the 10 raw dimension scores to identify structural relationships and test the framework's oppositional design.
4.  **Archetypal Analysis:** Speakers were profiled by averaging their scores across all metrics. A rule-based classification system, derived from the framework's interpretive guidance, was then applied to categorize each speaker's dominant rhetorical pattern (e.g., "Authentic Virtue," "Strategic Pathology").

### Limitations

The primary limitation of this study is its **small sample size (N=8)**. With only one speech per speaker, the findings represent a snapshot of a single performance and cannot be generalized to the speakers' overall rhetorical styles. All conclusions should be considered **preliminary and indicative**, serving as hypotheses for future, larger-scale research. The lack of a corpus manifest also prevented a planned validation analysis comparing scores across pre-defined rhetorical styles. Therefore, this report focuses on internal validation (construct validity via correlations) and pattern exploration rather than external validation or definitive claims about the speakers themselves.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the 20 primary metrics across all eight documents reveals the general rhetorical tendencies within this corpus. Vices such as `resentment` (mean raw = 0.71) and `tribalism` (mean raw = 0.51) appear more frequently and with higher intensity than vices like `fantasy` (mean raw = 0.20). Among virtues, `truth` (mean raw = 0.66) and `justice` (mean raw = 0.63) are the most prominent. The standard deviations are relatively high across the board, indicating significant variation between the speeches and confirming that the corpus contains a diverse range of rhetorical styles suitable for testing the framework's discriminatory power.

*(Note: Salience scores follow similar patterns and are omitted for brevity).*

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Character Profiles and Tension

The derived metrics provide a more holistic view of each speaker's rhetorical character. The **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)** offers a single, powerful score summarizing a speaker's orientation. As shown in Table 2, the speakers in this corpus span a wide range, from John McCain's highly positive score (+0.80) to Steve King's highly negative score (-0.48).

The rule-based **Pattern Classification** further illuminates these differences. John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney are classified as "Authentic Virtue," characterized by high CCI scores, high mean virtue, low mean vice, and very low mean tension. This suggests a coherent, consistent appeal to civic virtues. For instance, John McCain's speech is marked by its embrace of `dignity` and rejection of `tribalism`. As he stated: *"This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight."* (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`). This quote exemplifies a direct appeal to universal dignity over partisan division.

In contrast, Bernie Sanders and Steve King are classified as "Strategic Pathology." Their profiles are defined by low CCI scores and a dominance of vice-based appeals. Bernie Sanders' speech, for example, scores exceptionally high on `resentment` (raw=0.95, salience=1.0) and `tribalism` (raw=0.9, salience=0.9). His rhetoric creates a sharp in-group/out-group dynamic, as he stated: *"I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%."* (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`).

The **Mean Tension** score reveals another layer of strategy. Bernie Sanders exhibits the highest tension (0.14), indicating a significant blend of opposing appeals. His speech combines strong appeals to `resentment` with appeals to `justice`, and `tribalism` with appeals to `dignity`. This high-tension strategy appears designed to harness the energy of grievance while framing it within a positive, aspirational goal of justice. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also shows relatively high tension (0.09) and a CCI near zero, placing her as a "Virtue-Leaning" but highly contested actor, employing a mix of virtue and vice appeals with nearly equal force.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix of the ten raw dimension scores (Table 3) provides powerful evidence for the internal coherence and construct validity of the CAF. The analysis reveals two distinct and oppositional clusters of rhetorical dimensions.

The **Virtue Cluster** (`dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, `hope`, `pragmatism`) shows moderately positive inter-correlations. For example, `dignity` is strongly correlated with `justice` (r = +0.87), suggesting that appeals to universal human worth often co-occur with calls for systemic fairness.

The **Vice Cluster** (`tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, `fantasy`) is also internally coherent. `Tribalism` is very strongly correlated with `manipulation` (r = +0.91), and `manipulation` is very strongly correlated with `fantasy` (r = +0.89). This suggests a meta-strategy based on creating an in-group, simplifying reality, and using deceptive framing to motivate that group.

Most importantly, the analysis shows strong, consistent **negative correlations between the virtue and vice clusters**. The relationship between `pragmatism` and its opposite, `fantasy`, is nearly perfectly inverse (r = -0.93). Similarly, `pragmatism` is strongly negatively correlated with `manipulation` (r = -0.91). This indicates that speakers who ground their arguments in complexity and real-world constraints tend to avoid simplistic, emotionally manipulative narratives. The speech from John McCain, which scored high on `pragmatism` (0.9), illustrates this by directly acknowledging complexity: *"These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face."* (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`). Conversely, the speech from Bernie Sanders, which scored zero on `pragmatism`, contains a high degree of `fantasy` (0.7) through its simplification of economic issues, as in: *"The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on."* (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`).

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix of CAF Raw Dimension Scores**

| **pragmatism**| -0.76     | 0.67    | -0.91        | 0.52   | -0.51      | 0.43    | -0.30  | 0.37   | -0.93   | 1.00       |

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns revealed by this analysis strongly support the theoretical underpinnings of the CAF. The framework is designed to measure civic character along axes of competing values, and the correlation matrix confirms that these axes represent genuine rhetorical trade-offs.

The strongest correlations in the dataset—`pragmatism`/`fantasy` (r = -0.93), `manipulation`/`pragmatism` (r = -0.91), and `tribalism`/`manipulation` (r = +0.91)—reveal a fundamental cleavage in political communication strategies present in this corpus. One strategy, which could be termed **"principled realism,"** combines `pragmatism`, `truth`, and `dignity`. It acknowledges complexity, appeals to shared values, and relies on intellectual honesty. The other, **"pathological simplification,"** combines `fantasy`, `manipulation`, and `tribalism`. It denies complexity, creates divisive in-groups, and uses emotional framing to persuade.

This finding provides strong, albeit preliminary, evidence for the framework's construct validity. The oppositional structure is not an artifact of the definitions but appears to be an empirical reality in the discourse analyzed. The data suggests that speakers make strategic choices that align them with one of these broader rhetorical postures. For example, a speaker cannot easily combine a high degree of `pragmatism` with a high degree of `fantasy`; the choice of one largely precludes the other. This is illustrated by the absence of a quote for `pragmatism` in the Sanders speech, which the analysis notes is because *"the speech contains no acknowledgement of complexity, trade-offs, or realistic constraints."* (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`).

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the CAF v10.0 appears to be an effective instrument for the nuanced analysis of political discourse.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully distinguished between different speakers and rhetorical events, producing a wide distribution on the main CCI metric and identifying distinct clusters of behavior (e.g., "Authentic Virtue" vs. "Strategic Pathology"). This suggests it is sensitive enough to capture meaningful variation.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The strong internal consistency and oppositional structure observed in the correlation matrix indicate a good fit between the framework's theoretical constructs and the rhetorical patterns present in the corpus. The framework's dimensions map well onto the strategies employed by the speakers.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The concept of "Tension" proves to be a valuable analytical innovation. It allows the framework to move beyond a simple good/bad binary and identify more complex, ambiguous strategies where speakers attempt to leverage both virtue and vice. This is crucial for understanding modern political communication, where such hybrid appeals are common. The failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function highlights a critical dependency: the framework's full potential can only be realized with well-annotated corpora that include metadata on speaker style, context, and intent.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

The results of this analysis carry several important theoretical implications. First, they lend empirical support to virtue-ethics-based approaches to discourse analysis. The data suggests that civic virtues and vices, as defined by the CAF, are not merely abstract ideals but correspond to observable, measurable, and structurally related rhetorical patterns. The coherence of the virtue and vice clusters suggests that speakers adopt holistic rhetorical postures rather than making isolated word choices.

Second, the analysis validates the CAF's focus on **tensions between competing values**. The high tension scores for speakers like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggest that a significant part of contemporary political strategy involves navigating and exploiting these tensions. This finding challenges simpler models of political speech that might classify a speaker as purely "positive" or "negative." The CAF provides a vocabulary and a metric for analyzing this strategic ambiguity. For example, Sanders' rhetoric simultaneously leverages `resentment` over past wrongs and `justice` as a future goal, a potent combination that a less nuanced framework might miss. His call to change a *"rigged economy"* (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`) is coded as both `resentment` (identifying a grievance) and `justice` (a call for systemic change).

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

Despite the small sample, the analysis reveals several distinct rhetorical archetypes that warrant further investigation:

1.  **The Principled Statesman (McCain, Romney):** This archetype is defined by a high CCI, extremely low vice scores, and minimal tension. Their rhetoric is characterized by appeals to `dignity`, `pragmatism`, and `truth`. They actively work to bridge divides and acknowledge complexity, as seen in McCain's concession speech.
2.  **The Vice-Driven Agitator (King, Vance):** This archetype occupies the opposite pole, with a highly negative CCI and a dominance of vice-based appeals like `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `manipulation`. Their rhetoric is divisive and simplifies complex issues into clear-cut battles between good and evil.
3.  **The High-Tension Populist (Sanders):** This archetype is perhaps the most complex. While scoring negatively on the CCI and being classified as "Strategic Pathology," this speaker is not purely vice-driven. Instead, the strategy involves a potent, high-tension blend of vice (especially `resentment` and `tribalism`) and virtue (especially `justice` and `hope`). This allows the speaker to mobilize a base through grievance while maintaining a claim to a higher moral purpose.
4.  **The Contested Progressive (Ocasio-Cortez):** This archetype is characterized by a CCI near zero and high tension. It represents a rhetorical battleground where strong appeals to virtue (`justice`, `dignity`) are deployed alongside significant appeals to vice (`tribalism`, `resentment`), resulting in a rhetorically incoherent or strategically multifaceted message.

### Limitations and Future Directions

It is critical to reiterate that these findings are based on a very small (N=8) and cross-sectional dataset. The archetypes are suggestive, not definitive, and the scores reflect single speeches, not the speakers' entire careers.

Future research should prioritize several areas:
*   **Scale:** Applying the CAF to a large-N corpus of thousands of political speeches to test whether these archetypes and correlational structures hold.
*   **Longitudinal Analysis:** Tracking speakers over time to see if their civic character scores change in response to political events, such as running for higher office or changes in party leadership.
*   **Contextual Annotation:** Building a corpus with rich metadata (e.g., speech context, audience, speaker's political position) to perform more robust validation, such as the `validate_framework_by_style` analysis that was not possible here.
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** Using the archetypes identified here as a basis for generating testable hypotheses about rhetorical effectiveness, audience reception, and political outcomes. For instance, does high-tension rhetoric lead to higher engagement but also greater polarization?

## 7. Conclusion

This computational social science analysis demonstrates the significant analytical purchase of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. By operationalizing concepts from political theory, the framework successfully quantified the civic character of political discourse within a small but diverse corpus. The study identified coherent, oppositional meta-strategies of virtue and vice, providing strong preliminary evidence for the framework's construct validity.

The key contributions of this report are the identification of distinct rhetorical archetypes—from the low-tension "Principled Statesman" to the high-tension "Populist"—and the empirical validation of the framework's core theoretical assumptions. The derived metrics, particularly the Civic Character Index and the Tension Indices, proved to be powerful tools for summarizing complex rhetorical postures and revealing subtle strategic choices.

While the small sample size necessitates caution, the clarity of the patterns suggests that the CAF is a promising tool for future research. The findings lay a foundation for larger-scale, methodologically rigorous investigations into the character of civic discourse, its strategic deployment by political actors, and its potential consequences for democratic health. This pilot study serves as a proof of concept, highlighting a path toward a more nuanced, data-driven understanding of political rhetoric.
