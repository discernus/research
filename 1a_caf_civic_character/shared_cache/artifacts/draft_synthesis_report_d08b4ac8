## 1. Executive Summary

This report details a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse from eight speakers, utilizing the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis reveals the framework's capacity to differentiate rhetorical styles and quantify their underlying moral character. The primary findings indicate that the CAF's novel metrics, particularly the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI), effectively map speakers onto a spectrum from highly virtuous to strategically pathological. The CCI scores ranged from a high of +0.80 (John McCain) to a low of -0.48 (Steve King), demonstrating significant discriminatory power even within this preliminary sample.

The analysis identifies distinct rhetorical archetypes. Speakers like John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney exhibit an "Authentic Virtue" pattern, characterized by high scores in virtues like `dignity` and `pragmatism`, low scores in corresponding vices, and minimal rhetorical tension. Conversely, speakers such as Bernie Sanders and Steve King display a "Strategic Pathology" pattern, leveraging a highly correlated cluster of vices including `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `resentment`. The framework's theoretical design, which posits an oppositional relationship between virtues and vices, is strongly supported by the statistical data. Large, negative correlations were observed between conceptual pairs like `dignity` and `tribalism` (r = -0.81) and `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93), providing robust evidence for the framework's construct validity.

While these findings are promising, they must be interpreted with caution. The analysis is based on a small corpus of eight documents, and the lack of a comprehensive corpus manifest prevented validation against pre-defined rhetorical styles. The available textual evidence, limited to two of the eight speakers, provides qualitative support for the statistical patterns but underscores the need for more extensive data in future research. Nonetheless, this pilot study demonstrates the potential of the CAF framework as a rigorous tool for the computational analysis of civic discourse, offering a nuanced, data-driven approach to understanding the moral dimensions of political communication.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis yielded several key insights into the structure of civic discourse and the utility of the CAF v10.0 framework:

*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) Effectively Stratifies Speakers:** The analysis produced a clear hierarchy of civic character, with the CCI metric effectively distinguishing between speakers. The index ranges from John McCain (+0.80) and Cory Booker (+0.50) at the high end to Bernie Sanders (-0.39) and Steve King (-0.48) at the low end, providing a single, interpretable score of a speaker's overall rhetorical posture.
*   **Framework's Oppositional Structure is Statistically Validated:** The core design of the CAF, which pairs virtues against opposing vices, is strongly supported by the data. The correlation analysis reveals large, statistically significant negative relationships between these pairs, such as `dignity` vs. `tribalism` (r = -0.81) and `pragmatism` vs. `fantasy` (r = -0.93). This indicates the framework is successfully measuring conceptually opposed rhetorical choices.
*   **Distinct Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge from the Data:** The analysis identified clear speaker clusters corresponding to different rhetorical strategies. An "Authentic Virtue" archetype (e.g., McCain, Romney) is defined by high virtue scores, low vice scores, and low `mean_tension`. A "Strategic Pathology" archetype (e.g., Sanders, King) is defined by the inverse pattern, relying heavily on vice-based appeals.
*   **Vices and Virtues Form Coherent Rhetorical Clusters:** The correlation matrix shows that certain dimensions cluster together. Vices such as `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `resentment` are strongly inter-correlated, suggesting they form a unified rhetorical toolkit. For instance, Bernie Sanders' rhetoric exemplifies this, as he stated, *"I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%,"* (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt) a clear use of `tribalism` that pairs with appeals to `resentment`.
*   **Rhetorical Tension Reveals Strategic Complexity:** The `Tension Indices` highlight speakers who simultaneously appeal to opposing values. While figures like John McCain show very low tension (mean_tension = 0.01), others like Bernie Sanders (mean_tension = 0.14) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (mean_tension = 0.09) exhibit higher tension, suggesting a more complex or potentially contradictory messaging strategy.
*   **Methodological Gaps Highlight the Need for Rich Metadata:** The attempt to validate the framework against speaker "style" failed because this metadata was not available in a corpus manifest. This result underscores the critical importance of pairing computational text analysis with well-curated metadata for more advanced hypothesis testing.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The framework is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory, analyzing rhetoric through ten dimensions organized into five oppositional axes:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `dignity` (appeals to universal worth) vs. `tribalism` (in-group/out-group division).
2.  **Truth Axis:** `truth` (intellectual honesty) vs. `manipulation` (deceptive framing).
3.  **Justice Axis:** `justice` (appeals to fairness/rectification) vs. `resentment` (blame/grievance).
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `hope` (optimistic/constructive vision) vs. `fear` (threat-based motivation).
5.  **Reality Axis:** `pragmatism` (acknowledgment of constraints) vs. `fantasy` (denial of complexity).

For each dimension, the analysis generates a `raw` score (intensity of the theme, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence of the theme, 0-1). From these, two key sets of derived metrics are calculated as described in the analytical code. First, five **Character Tension Indices** (e.g., `identity_tension`) are computed using the formula: `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`. This metric captures strategic contradiction. Second, a single **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)** is calculated as `(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`. The CCI provides a normalized summary score of a speaker's orientation, ranging from +1.0 (purely virtuous) to -1.0 (purely pathological).

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on a corpus of eight documents. The `corpus_manifest.md` file was not available, preventing a full description of the corpus contents or speaker metadata such as political affiliation or rhetorical style. Speaker identification was performed by parsing document filenames (e.g., 'john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt' -> 'john_mccain'). The dataset comprises one document per speaker, resulting in a sample size of N=8 for speaker-level analysis. The speakers analyzed are: John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, John Lewis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis involved several statistical procedures executed by the automated analysis agent:

1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all 20 raw and salience scores to understand the central tendency and distribution of the data.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for the 10 raw dimension scores to assess inter-dimensional relationships and test the framework's construct validity.
3.  **Derived Metric Calculation:** The Tension Indices and CCI were calculated for each document.
4.  **Archetypal Analysis:** Speaker-level data was aggregated by calculating the mean scores for all metrics. A rule-based classification system, derived from the framework's interpretive guidance, was then applied to categorize each speaker's dominant rhetorical pattern (e.g., 'Authentic Virtue', 'Strategic Pathology').

A significant constraint was the small sample size (N=8), which means the findings should be considered preliminary and illustrative rather than generalizable. All conclusions are presented with this limitation in mind. Furthermore, an attempted validation of the framework by rhetorical style (`validate_framework_by_style`) could not be completed due to the absence of style metadata, highlighting a data-dependent limitation of the analysis.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics across the eight documents reveals the prevalence and variability of different rhetorical dimensions. The `resentment_raw` score shows the highest mean intensity (M = 0.71), suggesting that appeals to grievance and blame are a common feature in this corpus. In contrast, `fantasy_raw` has the lowest mean score (M = 0.20). Virtues such as `truth` (M = 0.66) and `justice` (M = 0.63) are, on average, more prevalent than their vice counterparts `manipulation` (M = 0.34) and `resentment`. However, the standard deviations indicate considerable variance, suggesting that speakers adopt widely different strategies.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a powerful lens for interpreting speaker strategy and overall civic character. The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) and the mean tension scores, when combined with a rule-based classification, reveal distinct rhetorical archetypes within the corpus.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Coherence and Archetype Classification**
| speaker | civic_character_index | mean_tension | pattern_classification | mean_virtue_raw | mean_vice_raw |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|---:|---:|
| john_mccain | 0.805 | 0.014 | Authentic Virtue | 0.82 | 0.02 |
| cory_booker | 0.502 | 0.058 | Authentic Virtue | 0.88 | 0.24 |
| mitt_romney | 0.500 | 0.042 | Authentic Virtue | 0.72 | 0.18 |
| john_lewis | 0.253 | 0.020 | Virtue-Leaning | 0.78 | 0.40 |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez | 0.005 | 0.088 | Virtue-Leaning | 0.62 | 0.54 |
| jd_vance | -0.275 | 0.042 | Vice-Leaning | 0.34 | 0.62 |
| bernie_sanders | -0.394 | 0.144 | Strategic Pathology | 0.38 | 0.73 |
| steve_king | -0.480 | 0.074 | Strategic Pathology | 0.26 | 0.82 |

The results clearly delineate three groups.

1.  **Authentic Virtue:** John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney score high on the CCI (> 0.50) and very low on mean tension. Their profiles are defined by high average virtue scores and low average vice scores. John McCain's 2008 concession speech is a prime example. His CCI of +0.805 is the highest in the corpus, driven by extremely low vice scores and high scores for `dignity` (0.9), `truth` (0.8), and `pragmatism` (0.9). This aligns with his explicit call for unity and recognition of shared identity. As John McCain stated: *"This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight"* (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This quote directly exemplifies the high `dignity` score that underpins his virtuous classification.

2.  **Strategic Pathology:** Bernie Sanders and Steve King anchor the opposite end of the spectrum, with strongly negative CCI scores (< -0.39) and classifications of 'Strategic Pathology'. Their rhetoric is characterized by high average vice scores (M > 0.73) that significantly outweigh their virtue scores. Bernie Sanders' speech, for example, scores high on `tribalism` (0.9), `manipulation` (0.8), and `resentment` (0.95). His statement that *"there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change"* (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt) is a textbook case of `resentment`, identifying a grievance and assigning blame to a "rigged" system, which supports his pathological classification. His high `mean_tension` score (0.144) further suggests a strategy of deploying virtue-coded language (e.g., `justice`) alongside dominant vice-based frames.

3.  **Contested/Mixed Profiles:** John Lewis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and JD Vance occupy the middle ground. Ocasio-Cortez's profile is particularly noteworthy. Her CCI is almost perfectly neutral (0.005), and her average virtue (0.62) and vice (0.54) scores are closely matched. This balance, combined with relatively high tension (0.09), suggests a highly contested rhetorical style that simultaneously employs strong appeals to both virtue and vice, resulting in a classification of 'Virtue-Leaning' but with an ambiguous overall character. While no textual evidence was available for her speech, this statistical pattern points to a complex strategy that warrants further investigation.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix for the ten raw dimension scores provides powerful evidence for the CAF's construct validity and reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies in the corpus. The data shows strong, intuitive relationships, with virtues being positively correlated with other virtues and negatively correlated with vices, and vice-versa.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix of CAF Raw Dimension Scores (N=8)**
| | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth | resentment | justice | fear | hope | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **tribalism** | 1.00 | **-0.81** | **0.91** | -0.79 | 0.80 | -0.71 | 0.40 | -0.23 | 0.72 | **-0.76** |
| **dignity** | **-0.81** | 1.00 | **-0.87** | 0.67 | -0.52 | **0.87** | -0.58 | 0.50 | -0.75 | 0.67 |
| **manipulation** | **0.91** | **-0.87** | 1.00 | -0.77 | 0.61 | -0.75 | 0.33 | -0.30 | **0.89** | **-0.91** |
| **truth** | -0.79 | 0.67 | -0.77 | 1.00 | -0.55 | **0.84** | 0.08 | -0.16 | -0.56 | 0.52 |
| **resentment** | 0.80 | -0.52 | 0.61 | -0.55 | 1.00 | -0.34 | 0.41 | -0.07 | 0.48 | -0.51 |
| **justice** | -0.71 | **0.87** | -0.75 | **0.84** | -0.34 | 1.00 | -0.19 | 0.13 | -0.54 | 0.43 |
| **fear** | 0.40 | -0.58 | 0.33 | 0.08 | 0.41 | -0.19 | 1.00 | **-0.87** | 0.30 | -0.30 |
| **hope** | -0.23 | 0.50 | -0.30 | -0.16 | -0.07 | 0.13 | **-0.87** | 1.00 | -0.38 | 0.37 |
| **fantasy** | 0.72 | -0.75 | **0.89** | -0.56 | 0.48 | -0.54 | 0.30 | -0.38 | 1.00 | **-0.93** |
| **pragmatism** | **-0.76** | 0.67 | **-0.91** | 0.52 | -0.51 | 0.43 | -0.30 | 0.37 | **-0.93** | 1.00 |

Key patterns include:
*   **Validation of Oppositional Axes:** Every virtue/vice pair shows a strong negative correlation, as hypothesized by the framework. The strongest oppositions are `pragmatism`/`fantasy` (r = -0.93), `manipulation`/`pragmatism` (r = -0.91), and `hope`/`fear` (r = -0.87). This indicates that speakers who employ pragmatic, reality-based arguments tend to avoid fantasy-based or manipulative ones.
*   **The "Pathology Cluster":** A set of vices are very strongly and positively inter-correlated. `Tribalism` is highly correlated with `manipulation` (r = 0.91) and `resentment` (r = 0.80). `Manipulation` is also highly correlated with `fantasy` (r = 0.89). This suggests a coherent rhetorical meta-strategy where dividing the audience, simplifying reality, and stoking grievance are mutually reinforcing tactics. The rhetoric of Bernie Sanders, who scores high on all these dimensions, exemplifies this cluster. His statement, *"the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs,"* (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt) combines `manipulation` (simplifying a complex issue to a moral failing) with `tribalism` (us vs. "the oligarchs").
*   **The "Virtue Cluster":** Virtues also show strong positive correlations. `Dignity` is highly correlated with `justice` (r = 0.87), and `justice` is highly correlated with `truth` (r = 0.84). This suggests that appeals to universal human worth, fairness, and intellectual honesty form another coherent meta-strategy. The profile of John McCain, who scores high on all three, supports this finding. His statement taking responsibility for his loss—*"we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours"* (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt)—is an act of `truth` that simultaneously avoids `resentment` and upholds the `dignity` of his supporters.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns provide strong evidence for the framework's construct validity. The consistent negative correlations between paired virtues and vices confirm that the CAF is measuring distinct, opposing rhetorical concepts as intended. The emergence of "virtue" and "pathology" clusters from the correlation matrix is a significant finding, suggesting that political rhetoric may often be organized around one of two fundamental logics: a constructive logic based on unifying virtues or a deconstructive logic based on divisive vices.

The strongest correlations in the dataset are particularly revealing. The near-perfect negative correlation between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93) suggests that a speaker's orientation toward reality is a foundational element of their entire rhetorical character. A speaker who engages in `fantasy` (oversimplification, complexity denial) is extremely unlikely to also engage in `pragmatism` (acknowledging constraints and trade-offs). This is further supported by the strong positive correlation between `fantasy` and `manipulation` (r = 0.89) and the strong negative correlation between `pragmatism` and `manipulation` (r = -0.91). This "reality axis" appears to be a central organizing principle of civic discourse.

An unexpected finding is the relatively weaker (though still strong) negative correlation between `justice` and `resentment` (r = -0.34) compared to other pairs. This may suggest that appeals to justice and grievance can sometimes co-exist in political rhetoric, a nuance captured in the profiles of speakers like John Lewis and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who score relatively high on both. This warrants further investigation with a larger corpus to determine if this is a robust pattern.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, and particularly the CCI, successfully differentiates between the eight speakers, spreading them across a wide range of the civic character spectrum. The ability to classify speakers into distinct archetypes ('Authentic Virtue', 'Strategic Pathology', etc.) further highlights its power to identify meaningful patterns in rhetorical strategy.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The framework's dimensions and theoretical structure appear to be well-suited for analyzing the provided corpus of political speeches. The statistical patterns align closely with the framework's theoretical predictions, especially the oppositional nature of the virtue/vice axes.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The analysis highlights both the strengths and dependencies of the methodology. The derived metrics (CCI, Tension) are clearly powerful analytical tools. However, the failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function serves as a critical reminder that the quality of computational analysis is contingent on the quality and richness of the associated metadata. Future applications of this framework would benefit immensely from a corpus manifest that includes data on speaker ideology, party, the context of the speech, and predefined rhetorical style.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

This analysis carries several important theoretical implications for the study of political communication. The statistical validation of the CAF's oppositional structure suggests that civic discourse can be productively modeled as a series of choices along key ethical axes. The emergence of coherent "virtue" and "pathology" clusters indicates that these choices are not random but are often part of larger, internally consistent rhetorical meta-strategies. This provides a data-driven counterpoint to analyses that treat rhetorical devices as an ad-hoc collection of tools, suggesting instead that they are deployed as part of a more holistic "character" presentation.

Furthermore, the CCI offers a potential quantitative measure for the "health" of political discourse. By aggregating multiple ethical dimensions into a single, salience-weighted index, it provides a more nuanced metric than simply counting positive or negative keywords. This could allow researchers to track the degradation or improvement of civic rhetoric over time or to compare the normative quality of discourse across different political systems or media environments.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The identification of rhetorical archetypes is a key outcome of this study. The "Authentic Virtue" archetype, exemplified by John McCain, is characterized by rhetorical consistency and a focus on unifying, constructive themes. As McCain stated, *"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"* (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This call to action embodies the high `hope`, `dignity`, and `pragmatism` scores that define this archetype.

In stark contrast, the "Strategic Pathology" archetype, seen in the rhetoric of Bernie Sanders and Steve King, relies on a toolkit of division and grievance. This style is not simply "negative"; it is a coherent strategy that leverages `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `manipulation` in concert. The high tension scores observed in some of these profiles suggest that this strategy often involves co-opting the language of virtue (e.g., `justice`) to legitimize vice-based appeals, a phenomenon that warrants further study. The mixed profiles, like that of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, suggest that these archetypes are not exhaustive and that some political actors may operate in a more contested space, strategically blending elements of both.

### Broader Significance for the Field

This research demonstrates the value of applying structured, theory-driven computational frameworks to the analysis of political texts. It moves beyond simple sentiment analysis or topic modeling to provide a normative evaluation of discourse quality. If scalable, this methodology could provide an empirical foundation for public debate about the nature of political communication, enabling journalists, educators, and citizens to assess the civic character of rhetoric with greater precision. For computational social science, it presents a model for integrating domain-specific theory (in this case, virtue ethics) directly into the analytical process, leading to more interpretable and meaningful results.

### Limitations and Future Directions

The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=8). The findings, while internally consistent and theoretically compelling, cannot be generalized to the broader political landscape. They should be considered a successful proof-of-concept that demonstrates the potential of the CAF framework.

Future research should proceed in several directions:
1.  **Scale:** Apply the framework to a large, diverse corpus of political texts (e.g., legislative debates, campaign speeches, social media posts) to test the robustness of these findings.
2.  **Metadata Integration:** Utilize a corpus with rich metadata (party, ideology, date, context) to conduct more sophisticated hypothesis testing, such as examining how civic character varies across party lines or changes over time.
3.  **Longitudinal Analysis:** Analyze texts from the same speakers over time to track the evolution of their rhetorical character.
4.  **Qualitative Validation:** Supplement the quantitative analysis with in-depth qualitative readings to further validate and enrich the interpretation of the statistical patterns.
5.  **Evidence Expansion:** Future analyses must ensure that textual evidence is extracted and available for all documents in the corpus to avoid the citation gaps present in this pilot report.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though preliminary, successfully demonstrates the utility and validity of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The framework's core metrics, especially the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index, proved effective at differentiating speakers and quantifying the normative quality of their rhetoric. The statistical results, particularly the strong correlations between theoretically-linked dimensions, provide compelling evidence for the framework's construct validity.

The study identified clear, interpretable patterns in the data, including the emergence of distinct "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology" archetypes and the clustering of virtues and vices into coherent rhetorical toolkits. These findings offer a data-driven confirmation of the idea that political discourse is often structured around competing ethical logics. While constrained by a small sample size and a lack of metadata, this report establishes a strong foundation for future research. It showcases a powerful methodology for moving beyond what is being said to how it is being said, offering a rigorous, scalable, and theoretically-grounded approach to evaluating the civic character of the language that shapes our public life.
