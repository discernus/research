### Executive Summary

This report details the application of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.3 to a corpus of eight political texts. The analysis focused on differentiating speaker character patterns, identifying unique signatures, and examining the framework's internal consistency.

Key findings indicate that the framework can identify distinct character signatures for individual speakers by comparing their respective Virtue and Pathology Indices [2]. For example, the analysis revealed contrasting profiles, such as a "High Civic Character" signature for John McCain (Virtue Index: 0.83, Pathology Index: 0.05) and a "Low Civic Character" signature for J.D. Vance (Virtue Index: 0.24, Pathology Index: 0.78) [2].

Correlation analysis provides support for the framework's theoretical structure. Strong negative correlations were observed between opposing dimensions, such as Dignity and Tribalism (r = -0.79) and Truth and Manipulation (r = -0.86), validating the bipolar axis design [2]. Furthermore, strong positive correlations were found between dimensions within the same conceptual group, such as Dignity and Pragmatism (r = 0.94) and Tribalism and Manipulation (r = 0.94), suggesting coherent underlying constructs for virtue and pathology [2].

A primary limitation of this study is the sample size of one document per speaker (n=1). This prevents valid statistical testing (e.g., ANOVA) for hypotheses related to significant differences between speakers [1]. Consequently, while variation in scores is observed, claims of statistical significance cannot be made.

### Collaborator Section

#### Claim 1: Speaker Differentiation Testability

**Hypothesis:** The 10 CAF dimensions will show statistically significant differences between speakers. This hypothesis is not testable with the current dataset. The dataset contains only one observation (n=1) per speaker, which invalidates the use of statistical tests like ANOVA that require variance within and between groups.

*   "We're doing that and the very, very basic and simple principle that American leaders should look out for Americans." [1]
*   "And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people." [2]

#### Claim 2: Uniqueness of Character Signatures

**Hypothesis:** Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices. This hypothesis is supported by descriptive analysis. The calculated Virtue and Pathology Indices show distinct patterns for each speaker. For instance, John McCain's profile (Virtue Index = 0.83, Pathology Index = 0.05) contrasts sharply with that of J.D. Vance (Virtue Index = 0.24, Pathology Index = 0.78), demonstrating the framework's capacity to identify unique signatures [2].

*   "And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people." [3]
*   "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [4]
*   "It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, 'Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.'" [5]

#### Claim 3: Civic Character Score Variation

**Hypothesis:** MC-SCI scores will vary meaningfully between speakers, indicating different levels of character coherence. This hypothesis is not testable for statistical significance due to the n=1 sample size per speaker. While the Civic Character Index scores do show variation across the corpus, ranging from a minimum of 0.23 to a maximum of 0.89, it is not possible to determine if this variation is statistically meaningful [2].

*   "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [6]
*   "And even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America." [7]
*   "If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here." [8]

#### Claim 4: Coherence of Virtue Construct

**Exploratory Claim:** The framework's virtue dimensions exhibit internal coherence. This is supported by correlation analysis. A Pearson correlation analysis of the ten core dimensions revealed a very strong positive correlation between the Dignity and Pragmatism scores (r = 0.94), suggesting they measure related aspects of a coherent underlying virtue construct as theorized by the framework [2].

*   "It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, 'Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.'" [9]
*   "But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside." [10]
*   "And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people." [11]

#### Claim 5: Coherence of Pathology Construct

**Exploratory Claim:** The framework's pathology dimensions exhibit internal coherence. This is supported by correlation analysis. The analysis showed a very strong positive correlation between Tribalism and Manipulation scores (r = 0.94), indicating a coherent underlying pathology construct as proposed by the framework's theoretical design [2].

*   "The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others." [12]
*   "They want us to think that our lives are suffering because of the LGBT kid down the street or because of the mixed status family or the dreamer down the block who's just trying to make a better life for themselves. But we're smarter than that Greeley." [13]
*   "I'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced." [14]

#### Claim 6: Validation of Identity Axis

**Exploratory Claim:** The Dignity and Tribalism dimensions operate in opposition as a bipolar axis. This is supported by correlation analysis. A strong negative correlation was found between Dignity and Tribalism scores (r = -0.79), providing empirical support for the framework's theoretical assumption of an oppositional "Identity Axis" [2].

*   "It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, 'Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.'" [15]
*   "we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own." [16]

#### Claim 7: Validation of Virtue-Pathology Opposition

**Exploratory Claim:** The framework's virtue and pathology dimensions are inversely related. This is supported by correlation analysis. The strong negative correlation between the virtue of Truth and the pathology of Manipulation (r = -0.86) supports the framework's core theoretical premise of opposing virtue-pathology axes [2].

*   "Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values." [17]
*   "And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people." [18]
*   "But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside." [19]

#### Claim 8: Example of High Civic Character Signature

**Hypothesis:** Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices. This claim provides a specific example supporting the broader hypothesis. The profile for John McCain's 2008 concession speech shows a high Virtue Index (0.83) and a very low Pathology Index (0.05), representing a distinct "High Civic Character" signature [2].

*   "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [20]
*   "His success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving." [21]

#### Claim 9: Example of Low Civic Character Signature

**Hypothesis:** Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices. This claim provides a contrasting example supporting the broader hypothesis. The profile for J.D. Vance's 2022 conference address shows a low Virtue Index (0.24) and a high Pathology Index (0.78), representing a distinct "Low Civic Character" signature [2].

*   "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [22]
*   "And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people." [23]
*   "But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today." [24]
