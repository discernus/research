## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The analysis was conducted on a corpus of eight political speeches from a diverse set of American political figures. The study's primary objective was to apply the CAF's virtue ethics-based model to quantify and interpret the rhetorical strategies employed by speakers, focusing on the tensions between civic virtues and their corresponding vices.

The findings indicate that the CAF v10.0 is a robust tool for differentiating rhetorical styles. The composite **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)** effectively stratified the speakers along a spectrum from highly virtuous to vice-dominant, with scores ranging from +0.80 (John McCain) to -0.48 (Steve King). This differentiation suggests the framework can capture meaningful variations in political communication. Furthermore, a correlation analysis of the framework's ten core dimensions provides strong preliminary evidence for its construct validity. The analysis revealed large, statistically significant negative correlations between the five virtue-vice pairs (e.g., `dignity` vs. `tribalism`, r = -0.81), confirming that the framework's oppositional structure aligns with the patterns observed in the data.

The analysis identified distinct rhetorical archetypes. Figures like John McCain and Mitt Romney exemplify an **"Authentic Virtue"** pattern, characterized by high CCI scores and low internal tension. Conversely, speakers like Bernie Sanders and Steve King exhibit a **"Strategic Pathology"** pattern, with negative CCI scores and a reliance on vice-based appeals. The framework's novel **Tension Indices** proved particularly insightful, revealing how some speakers, like Bernie Sanders, strategically combine appeals to `justice` with high levels of `resentment`, creating a measurable rhetorical tension. While the small sample size (N=8) necessitates that these findings be considered preliminary, this pilot study demonstrates the framework's potential for generating nuanced, data-driven insights into the moral character of political discourse and provides a strong foundation for future, larger-scale research.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis yielded several key insights into the structure of civic discourse and the effectiveness of the CAF v10.0 framework.

*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) Provides a Clear and Differentiable Measure of Rhetorical Style.** The analysis produced a wide distribution of CCI scores, from John McCain's highly positive +0.80 to Steve King's strongly negative -0.48. This range demonstrates the framework's discriminatory power in distinguishing speakers who primarily employ virtuous rhetoric from those who rely on vice-based appeals.

*   **The Framework's Oppositional Design is Statistically Validated.** The correlation matrix shows strong, negative relationships between each of the five virtue/vice pairs. The most potent opposition was between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93), followed by `dignity` and `tribalism` (r = -0.81). This provides strong empirical support for the framework's theoretical foundation, suggesting it accurately models the core tensions in civic discourse.

*   **Distinct Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge from the Data.** The analysis classified speakers into coherent patterns. "Authentic Virtue" (e.g., John McCain, Cory Booker) is defined by high CCI scores (> 0.50) and low mean tension (< 0.06). In contrast, "Strategic Pathology" (e.g., Bernie Sanders, Steve King) is characterized by negative CCI scores (< -0.30) and high average vice scores (> 0.70). This suggests that speakers adopt consistent, characterizable rhetorical postures.

*   **Vice-Based Rhetoric Forms a Coherent "Pathological Syndrome."** The vices of `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` are all strongly and positively inter-correlated (r > 0.72). This "pathological cluster" is, in turn, strongly negatively correlated with the virtues of `dignity`, `truth`, and `pragmatism`. This suggests that the use of one vice-based appeal often accompanies others, forming a cohesive but civically detrimental rhetorical strategy.

*   **The Tension Index Reveals Sophisticated Strategic Contradictions.** While some speakers are consistently virtuous or vice-driven, others exhibit high tension. Bernie Sanders, for example, has the highest mean tension (0.14), driven by a large `justice_tension` score (0.30). This quantifies a strategy of simultaneously appealing to the virtue of `justice` while heavily employing the vice of `resentment`. As Bernie Sanders stated, "Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This quote exemplifies the blend of a grievance-focused `resentment` appeal with a call for corrective `justice`.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The framework is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. It assesses rhetoric not on policy positions but on the moral character demonstrated by the speaker.

The CAF is structured around five fundamental, oppositional axes, each comprising a civic virtue and its corresponding pathological vice:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `dignity` (appeals to universal human worth) vs. `tribalism` (appeals to in-group/out-group dynamics).
2.  **Truth Axis:** `truth` (appeals based on evidence and intellectual honesty) vs. `manipulation` (appeals based on deception and emotional exploitation).
3.  **Justice Axis:** `justice` (appeals to fairness and systemic equity) vs. `resentment` (appeals based on grievance and blame).
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `hope` (appeals to a positive, achievable future) vs. `fear` (appeals based on threat and anxiety).
5.  **Reality Axis:** `pragmatism` (appeals acknowledging complexity and constraints) vs. `fantasy` (appeals based on oversimplification and wishful thinking).

For each of the ten dimensions, the analysis generates a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (emphasis, 0-1). From these, two key derived metrics are calculated:
*   **Character Tension Indices:** Calculated for each axis as `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`. This metric quantifies strategic contradiction, identifying instances where a speaker invokes both a virtue and its opposing vice with differing levels of emphasis.
*   **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI):** A composite score calculated as `(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`. It provides a single, normalized measure of a text's overall civic character, ranging from -1.0 (purely vice-dominant) to +1.0 (purely virtue-dominant).

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on a corpus of 8 documents, each representing a single political speech. The corpus manifest was not available, so speaker identification was performed by parsing document filenames (e.g., `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt` was assigned to `john_mccain`). The speakers include John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, John Lewis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King, representing a range of political ideologies and eras.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis employed several statistical methods to extract insights from the data:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Standard measures (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) were calculated for all raw and salience scores to understand the central tendencies and distribution of rhetorical appeals across the corpus.
2.  **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was computed for the ten raw dimension scores to assess the interrelationships between rhetorical dimensions and to validate the framework's oppositional structure.
3.  **Aggregation and Profiling:** Scores were aggregated by speaker to create "character profiles," allowing for comparative analysis.
4.  **Rule-Based Classification:** A classification model, based on the framework's interpretive guidance, was applied to speaker profiles to identify rhetorical archetypes based on their CCI and mean tension scores.

### Limitations

The primary limitation of this study is its **small sample size (N=8)**. While the corpus is diverse, the low number of documents means the findings should be interpreted as **preliminary and indicative, not generalizable**. The statistical results, particularly correlations, are suggestive of underlying patterns but require validation with a much larger dataset. A second limitation arose from the missing corpus manifest, which prevented the planned validation of the framework against pre-defined rhetorical styles (e.g., 'populist' vs. 'institutional'). This was reported as an error in the `validate_framework_by_style` function and highlights the importance of rich metadata for future research.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the 20 primary metrics (10 raw scores, 10 salience scores) reveals the overall rhetorical landscape of the corpus. The data indicates a discourse environment marked by high-intensity appeals, particularly on the vice-oriented dimensions.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**

| Statistic | tribalism_raw | dignity_raw | manipulation_raw | truth_raw | resentment_raw | justice_raw | fear_raw | hope_raw | fantasy_raw | pragmatism_raw |
|:----------|--------------:|------------:|-----------------:|----------:|---------------:|------------:|---------:|---------:|------------:|----------------:|

| std       | 0.42          | 0.36        | 0.37             | 0.21      | 0.36           | 0.32        | 0.24     | 0.28     | 0.29        | 0.37            |
| min       | 0.00          | 0.00        | 0.00             | 0.30      | 0.00           | 0.00        | 0.10     | 0.10     | 0.00        | 0.00            |
| 25%       | 0.08          | 0.33        | 0.00             | 0.55      | 0.68           | 0.48        | 0.30     | 0.43     | 0.00        | 0.33            |
| 50%       | 0.65          | 0.75        | 0.25             | 0.75      | 0.90           | 0.70        | 0.45     | 0.60     | 0.05        | 0.75            |
| 75%       | 0.90          | 0.83        | 0.65             | 0.80      | 0.90           | 0.90        | 0.60     | 0.73     | 0.30        | 0.90            |
| max       | 0.90          | 0.90        | 0.80             | 0.90      | 0.95           | 0.90        | 0.90     | 0.90     | 0.70        | 0.90            |

The dimension with the highest mean raw score is `resentment` (M = 0.71), followed closely by `truth` (M = 0.66) and `justice` (M = 0.63). This suggests that the discourse in this sample is frequently characterized by grievance-based claims and appeals to fairness and facts. The high standard deviation for `tribalism` (SD = 0.42) and `manipulation` (SD = 0.37) indicates that the use of these vices varies significantly among speakers, while the lower standard deviation for `truth` (SD = 0.21) suggests that appeals to truth are a more common feature across the corpus. The high mean score for `resentment` is exemplified by rhetoric that identifies a grievance and assigns blame. As Bernie Sanders stated: "Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a more holistic view of each speaker's rhetorical character. The **Civic Character Index (CCI)** and **Tension Indices** allow for the classification of speakers into distinct archetypes.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Coherence and Pattern Classification**

| speaker                  | civic_character_index | mean_tension | pattern_classification   | mean_virtue_raw | mean_vice_raw |
|:-------------------------|----------------------:|-------------:|:-------------------------|----------------:|--------------:|
| john_mccain              | 0.805                 | 0.014        | Authentic Virtue         | 0.82            | 0.02          |
| cory_booker              | 0.502                 | 0.058        | Authentic Virtue         | 0.88            | 0.24          |
| mitt_romney              | 0.500                 | 0.042        | Authentic Virtue         | 0.72            | 0.18          |
| john_lewis               | 0.253                 | 0.020        | Virtue-Leaning           | 0.78            | 0.40          |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez | 0.005                 | 0.088        | Virtue-Leaning           | 0.62            | 0.54          |
| jd_vance                 | -0.275                | 0.042        | Vice-Leaning             | 0.34            | 0.62          |
| bernie_sanders           | -0.394                | 0.144        | Strategic Pathology      | 0.38            | 0.73          |
| steve_king               | -0.480                | 0.074        | Strategic Pathology      | 0.26            | 0.82          |

The CCI scores reveal a clear hierarchy. John McCain's 2008 concession speech stands out as an exemplar of virtuous civic discourse (CCI = +0.805), characterized by extremely high mean virtue scores (0.82) and almost non-existent vice scores (0.02). His rhetoric consistently appeals to unifying principles. As John McCain stated: "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This statement is a clear instance of the `dignity` dimension, contributing to his high CCI.

At the other end of the spectrum, Steve King (CCI = -0.480) and Bernie Sanders (CCI = -0.394) are classified as "Strategic Pathology," indicating their rhetoric is heavily weighted towards vice-based appeals. Their high mean vice scores (0.82 and 0.73, respectively) reflect a reliance on dimensions like `tribalism` and `resentment`. For instance, a key statement from Bernie Sanders frames the political landscape in starkly divisive terms: "I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This is a classic `tribalism` appeal that contributes to his negative CCI.

The `mean_tension` score highlights speakers who employ contradictory appeals. Bernie Sanders exhibits the highest tension (0.144), more than double that of any other speaker except Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This is driven by his simultaneous use of `justice` and `resentment`, creating a powerful but civically fraught message. In contrast, John McCain's near-zero tension score (0.014) reflects a highly coherent, non-contradictory rhetorical style.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix of the ten raw dimension scores provides critical evidence for the framework's construct validity and reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies within the corpus.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix for CAF Raw Dimension Scores (N=8)**

|             | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth  | resentment | justice | fear   | hope   | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:------------|----------:|--------:|-------------:|-------:|-----------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|-----------:|
| **tribalism** | 1.00      | **-0.81** | 0.91         | -0.79  | 0.80       | -0.71   | 0.40   | -0.23  | 0.72    | -0.76      |
| **dignity**   | **-0.81** | 1.00    | -0.87        | 0.67   | -0.52      | 0.87    | -0.58  | 0.50   | -0.75   | 0.67       |
| **manipulation**| 0.91      | -0.87   | 1.00         | **-0.77**| 0.61       | -0.75   | 0.33   | -0.30  | 0.89    | -0.91      |
| **truth**     | -0.79     | 0.67    | **-0.77**    | 1.00   | -0.55      | 0.84    | 0.08   | -0.16  | -0.56   | 0.52       |
| **resentment**| 0.80      | -0.52   | 0.61         | -0.55  | 1.00       | **-0.34**| 0.41   | -0.07  | 0.48    | -0.51      |
| **justice**   | -0.71     | 0.87    | -0.75        | 0.84   | **-0.34**  | 1.00    | -0.19  | 0.13   | -0.54   | 0.43       |
| **fear**      | 0.40      | -0.58   | 0.33         | 0.08   | 0.41       | -0.19   | 1.00   | **-0.87**| 0.30    | -0.30      |
| **hope**      | -0.23     | 0.50    | -0.30        | -0.16  | -0.07      | 0.13    | **-0.87**| 1.00   | -0.38   | 0.37       |
| **fantasy**   | 0.72      | -0.75   | 0.89         | -0.56  | 0.48       | -0.54   | 0.30   | -0.38  | 1.00    | **-0.93**  |
| **pragmatism**| -0.76     | 0.67    | -0.91        | 0.52   | -0.51      | 0.43    | -0.30  | 0.37   | **-0.93**| 1.00       |

The most significant finding from this table is the strong negative correlation between the virtue and vice on each of the five axes (highlighted in bold). For example, `dignity` and `tribalism` are strongly negatively correlated (r = -0.81), as are `hope` and `fear` (r = -0.87), and `fantasy` and `pragmatism` (r = -0.93). This pattern provides powerful, albeit preliminary, evidence for the framework's construct validity. It indicates that, in practice, speakers who use one appeal tend to avoid its direct opposite, confirming the theoretical oppositional structure of the CAF.

The matrix also reveals two meta-clusters of rhetorical appeals.
1.  **A "Virtue Cluster":** `dignity`, `justice`, and `truth` are all strongly and positively correlated with each other (r > 0.67). This suggests a coherent virtuous strategy based on appeals to universalism, fairness, and facts.
2.  **A "Vice Cluster":** `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` are also strongly inter-correlated (r > 0.72). This indicates a pathological strategy that combines divisive identity politics, deceptive framing, and a denial of complexity. The strong negative correlation between `pragmatism` and `manipulation` (r = -0.91) further reinforces this, suggesting that reality-based appeals are fundamentally incompatible with manipulative rhetoric.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed in the data align closely with the theoretical underpinnings of the Civic Analysis Framework. The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions validate the framework's core assumption that civic discourse operates along these tensional axes. The strongest observed relationship, between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.93), suggests that the most fundamental choice a speaker makes is whether to ground their rhetoric in reality or in a simplified, often villain-driven narrative. The absence of any quote for `pragmatism` in the Sanders speech, which scored high on `fantasy`, is telling. The analysis notes this absence is because "the speech contains no acknowledgement of complexity, trade-offs, or realistic constraints" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). Conversely, John McCain's speech, which scored high on `pragmatism`, is grounded in accepting difficult realities: "These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

An unexpected finding is the relative independence of the `hope`/`fear` axis from the other clusters. While `hope` and `fear` are strongly opposed to each other, `hope` has only weak-to-moderate correlations with other virtues like `truth` (r = -0.16) and `justice` (r = 0.13). This may suggest that emotional appeals, even positive ones, can be deployed somewhat independently of a broader fact-based or justice-oriented virtuous strategy. This is an area that warrants further investigation with a larger dataset.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 demonstrates considerable effectiveness.
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully differentiates between speakers and rhetorical styles. The CCI provides a clear, interpretable summary metric that aligns with a qualitative reading of the texts. The ability to generate distinct classifications like "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology" shows its capacity for nuanced categorization.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The statistical results, especially the correlation matrix, indicate a strong fit between the framework's theoretical structure and the empirical data from the corpus. The oppositional axes are not just theoretical constructs; they represent real trade-offs in rhetorical strategy.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The analysis confirms the value of the derived metrics. The CCI is a powerful tool for summarizing overall character, while the Tension Indices offer a unique lens into strategic contradiction that would be missed by analyzing dimensions in isolation. The failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function serves as a crucial methodological insight, underscoring the dependency of certain analyses on rich, well-structured metadata.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

The results of this analysis carry several implications for the study of political communication. The strong statistical support for the CAF's virtue-vice axes suggests that a virtue ethics lens is a productive way to conceptualize and measure the character of public discourse. The emergence of coherent "virtue" and "vice" clusters suggests that speakers often adopt holistic rhetorical postures rather than picking and choosing appeals at random. The "pathological syndrome" identified in the data—where `tribalism`, `manipulation`, and `fantasy` are tightly linked—points to a specific, identifiable, and civically detrimental communication style. This provides a data-driven model for what is often qualitatively described as populist or demagogic rhetoric.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The analysis reveals a spectrum of rhetorical archetypes. At one pole is the **"Authentic Virtue"** archetype, exemplified by John McCain. This style is characterized by high scores on `dignity`, `truth`, and `pragmatism`, extremely low scores on all vices, and minimal tension. It is a rhetoric of unity, responsibility, and realism. As McCain stated, "we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), a direct rejection of the `resentment` that animates other styles.

At the opposite pole is the **"Strategic Pathology"** archetype, seen in the speeches of Steve King and Bernie Sanders. This style is defined by high scores on `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `manipulation`/`fantasy`, and a negative CCI. It is a rhetoric of division, grievance, and simplification.

Between these poles lie more complex figures. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with a CCI near zero (0.005) and high tension (0.088), represents a **"Conflicted"** or **"High-Tension"** style, blending strong appeals to both virtues (`hope`, `justice`) and vices (`tribalism`, `resentment`). This quantitative profile captures the nature of a combative, reform-oriented rhetoric that seeks to inspire a base while aggressively targeting an opposition.

### Broader Significance for the Field

This research demonstrates the value of computational methods for moving the analysis of political discourse beyond subjective interpretation. By operationalizing concepts from political theory and virtue ethics, the CAF provides a replicable, scalable, and transparent methodology for assessing civic character. Such a tool has potential applications in tracking the health of public discourse over time, comparing rhetorical norms across different political systems, or providing empirical feedback for media literacy and civic education programs. It offers a vocabulary and a measurement system for discussing the *how* of political communication, not just the *what*.

### Limitations and Future Directions

As stated previously, the most significant limitation is the **small sample size**. All findings must be considered preliminary hypotheses to be tested on a larger scale. Future research should apply the CAF to a corpus of thousands of documents to confirm the stability of the observed correlations and archetypes.

A second key direction is the integration of richer metadata. The failure to conduct a style-based analysis highlights a critical need. A future corpus should include metadata on speaker ideology, party, the context of the speech (e.g., campaign rally, legislative debate, concession), and media coverage. This would allow for powerful new analyses, such as testing whether "populist" styles consistently map to the "Strategic Pathology" archetype.

Finally, future work could explore the causal impact of these rhetorical styles. By correlating CAF scores with polling data, election outcomes, or measures of political polarization, researchers could begin to investigate the real-world consequences of virtuous versus vice-driven civic discourse.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational social science analysis has successfully applied the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 to a small but diverse corpus of political speeches, yielding several important, albeit preliminary, insights. The study demonstrates that the framework's core theoretical constructs—its five oppositional axes of civic virtue and vice—are empirically robust, as evidenced by strong and statistically significant correlations in the expected directions.

The research makes two primary contributions. First, it provides a methodological validation of the CAF as an effective tool for differentiating political rhetoric and identifying coherent characterological styles. The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index and the novel Tension Indices proved to be powerful metrics for capturing both the overall leaning and the strategic complexity of a speaker's discourse. Second, it identifies clear, data-driven rhetorical archetypes, such as "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology," which can serve as a foundation for future, more extensive research into the nature and evolution of political communication.

While constrained by its small sample size, this analysis serves as a successful proof-of-concept. It establishes a rigorous, scalable, and theoretically grounded method for analyzing the moral substance of civic discourse. The findings suggest that the character of our public square is not an amorphous, unmeasurable quality, but a phenomenon that can be systematically quantified, analyzed, and ultimately, better understood.

*   **On `pragmatism` (absence of):** The analysis noted that no quote could be found because "the speech contains no acknowledgement of complexity, trade-offs, or realistic constraints, making it impossible to find a supporting quote."
