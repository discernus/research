    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the speaker's rhetorical choices in a legislative advocacy context. The speech is characterized by a strong appeal to the virtue-based dimensions (Dignity, Justice, Hope, Truth, Pragmatism) and a critique of the system through the lens of vice-based dimensions (especially Resentment). The salience scores reflect the centrality of the Justice/Resentment axis to the speech's overall argument. Dimensions like Manipulation and Fantasy were scored as absent as the speaker takes an evidence-based and pragmatic approach, explicitly framing the bill as a 'first step' and not a complete solution."
