## Part 1: The Scholarly Document

### Section 1: Abstract & *Raison d'Ãªtre*

**What is this framework?**
The Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) provides a systematic approach to evaluating the civic character of political discourse. It analyzes the moral character displayed by speakers, based on Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. The framework evaluates what civic virtues and vices speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices, focusing on the fundamental tensions between competing values.

**What problem does it solve?**
Democratic governance depends on civic discourse that embodies fundamental virtues. However, political communication often involves strategic tensions where speakers simultaneously appeal to competing virtues and their pathological counterparts. This framework provides a rigorous methodology for evaluating these tensions and assessing the overall civic character of political discourse....

# ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS

## Level 1: Basic Statistical Interpretation
- Interpret descriptive statistics for all measured dimensions
- Identify patterns in means, standard deviations, and distributions
- Note significant correlations and their strength
- Assess measurement quality using framework-appropriate validation:
  * For oppositional frameworks: Interpret negative correlations as validation (opposing constructs should be negatively correlated)
  * For unidimensional frameworks: Interpret traditional reliability metrics (Cronbach's Alpha)

## Level 2: Advanced Pattern Recognition  
- Analyze cross-dimensional relationships and interaction effects
- Identify statistical outliers and anomalous patterns
- Examine confidence patterns and analytical uncertainty
- Detect framework-specific insights from derived metrics

## Level 3: Cross-Dimensional Network Analysis
- Map dimensional clustering and meta-strategies
- Identify universal patterns across all cases
- Analyze tension patterns and strategic contradictions
- Assess variance decomposition and discriminatory power

## Level 4: Temporal and Archetypal Analysis
- Examine temporal progression patterns (when applicable)
- Identify rhetorical archetypes and speaker clustering
- Analyze normative layer gradients and trajectories
- Assess framework effectiveness and limitations

## Level 5: Meta-Analysis and Theoretical Integration
- Connect findings to relevant theoretical frameworks
- Identify methodological implications and innovations
- Generate testable hypotheses for future research
- Assess broader implications for the field

# REPORT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

## 0. Experiment Provenance Header (REQUIRED FIRST)
Start every report with available experiment metadata:

```
