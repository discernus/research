    "analysis_notes": "The analyzed document is a classic example of civil rights protest rhetoric. The analysis reflects the speech's strong emphasis on lived injustices and demands for specific, systemic change. The core of the speech lies on the Justice/Resentment axis, with high intensity and salience for both, reflecting a demand for justice fueled by righteous anger over grievances. The speech is also highly pragmatic, critiquing specific legislation rather than speaking in abstract terms. All scores are based on the direct rhetorical evidence in the text."
