The speech strongly frames an 'us vs. them' narrative between working people and an 'oligarchy', emphasizing grievances and manipulation by the latter, while calling for collective hope and action. Scores reflect high intensity and salience for tribalism, resentment, fear, manipulation, and hope, with less focus on complex pragmatic solutions or universal dignity beyond the in-group's deservingness."
