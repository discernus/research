The analysis synthesizes both parts. The speaker's rhetoric is a very strong and clear example of several 'vice' dimensions (Tribalism, Resentment, Fear, Manipulation), making scoring straightforward. The 'virtue' dimensions are almost entirely absent, with the exception of 'Truth' and 'Justice', which are invoked primarily to frame grievances."
