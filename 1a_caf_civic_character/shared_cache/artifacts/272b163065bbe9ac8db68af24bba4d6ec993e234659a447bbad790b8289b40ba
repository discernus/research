    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the speaker's rhetorical framing, which heavily relies on an 'us vs. them' narrative. The vices of Tribalism, Resentment, and Manipulation are highly salient and intense, forming the core of the message. Virtues like Pragmatism and Justice are present but are framed exclusively through this tribalistic lens, arguing for practical solutions and fairness for the in-group ('the American people') against the perceived failings of an out-group ('elites'). Other virtues are minimally present."
