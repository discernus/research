The speech is characterized by its graciousness, calls for unity, and respect for the democratic process, leading to high scores in virtue dimensions (Dignity, Hope, Pragmatism, Truth, Justice) and very low scores in vice dimensions (Tribalism, Manipulation, Resentment, Fantasy, Fear). Evidence extraction focused on the most explicit representations of each dimension's definition."
