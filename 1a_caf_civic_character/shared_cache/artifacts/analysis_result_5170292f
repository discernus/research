The speech is characterized by a strong sense of urgency, a catalogue of specific grievances, and a pragmatic critique of proposed legislation. The dominant themes are the demand for justice and the expression of resentment against ongoing oppression, with a concurrent appeal to the dignity of all people and a pragmatic approach to achieving concrete goals.
