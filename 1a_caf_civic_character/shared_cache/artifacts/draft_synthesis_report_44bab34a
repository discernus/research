## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the results of a computational analysis of political discourse using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The study analyzed a small corpus of eight political speeches to assess the civic character demonstrated by the speakers. The analysis leveraged the CAF's structure, which evaluates rhetoric along five oppositional axes: Dignity vs. Tribalism, Truth vs. Manipulation, Justice vs. Resentment, Hope vs. Fear, and Pragmatism vs. Fantasy. By quantifying the intensity and salience of these virtues and vices, the framework generates derived metrics, including a summary **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, which provides a holistic measure of a speaker's rhetorical profile.

The preliminary findings from this pilot study are highly suggestive. The CAF framework demonstrated significant discriminatory power, successfully differentiating the rhetorical styles of the eight speakers across a wide spectrum of CCI scores, from a high of +0.805 to a low of -0.480. Correlation analysis strongly supports the framework's theoretical underpinnings, revealing a robust oppositional structure where civic virtues cluster together and are negatively correlated with a corresponding cluster of civic vices. This suggests the framework is effectively measuring two competing meta-strategies in political communication. Furthermore, the analysis identified distinct rhetorical archetypes, such as "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology," which correspond to specific patterns of virtue, vice, and rhetorical tension. For example, John McCain's discourse was classified as "Authentic Virtue," a finding supported by textual evidence of his focus on unity and responsibility. As John McCain stated: **"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

While the small sample size (N=8) means these findings should be considered indicative rather than definitive, the results provide a strong proof-of-concept for the CAF's utility. The framework appears capable of moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to provide a nuanced, theory-driven evaluation of the moral character embedded in political language. The analysis highlights the framework's potential for identifying strategic contradictions and classifying speakers into meaningful rhetorical categories. Future research should aim to validate these findings on a larger, more diverse corpus with comprehensive metadata to enable more advanced validation, such as analysis by predefined rhetorical style.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis yielded several key insights into the structure of civic discourse and the effectiveness of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0.

*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) Effectively Differentiates Speakers:** The analysis produced a wide and meaningful distribution of CCI scores, ranging from John McCain (+0.805) to Steve King (-0.480). This demonstrates the framework's ability to place speakers on a quantifiable spectrum of civic virtue and vice, providing a powerful summary metric for comparative analysis.
*   **Strong Evidence for the Framework's Oppositional Design:** The correlation matrix reveals a clear and consistent oppositional structure. Virtuous dimensions (e.g., `dignity`, `truth`, `pragmatism`) are positively correlated with each other and strongly negatively correlated with their vicious counterparts (e.g., `tribalism`, `manipulation`, `fantasy`). For instance, `dignity` and `tribalism` show a strong negative correlation (r = -0.81), validating the core theoretical assumption of the framework.
*   **Two Competing Rhetorical Meta-Strategies Emerge:** The data suggests that speakers in this corpus primarily draw from one of two distinct rhetorical playbooks. The "Virtue Cluster" (`dignity`, `justice`, `truth`) and the "Vice Cluster" (`tribalism`, `resentment`, `manipulation`) represent coherent, opposing strategies for political communication. This is exemplified by the strong positive correlation between `tribalism` and `manipulation` (r = +0.91).
*   **Rhetorical Archetypes Can Be Statistically Identified:** The `analyze_character_coherence` function successfully classified speakers into distinct patterns like "Authentic Virtue" (e.g., John McCain) and "Strategic Pathology" (e.g., Bernie Sanders, Steve King). This classification is based on a combination of the overall CCI score, the balance of virtue and vice, and the degree of internal contradiction (tension).
*   **Rhetorical Tension Reveals Strategic Contradiction:** The analysis of "Tension Indices" highlights speakers who simultaneously employ high levels of both a virtue and its opposing vice. Bernie Sanders, for example, scores high on `justice_tension` (0.30), reflecting a message that combines strong calls for justice with potent appeals to resentment. As Bernie Sanders stated, framing a grievance to be corrected: **"Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change"** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).
*   **Absence of Evidence is Analytically Significant:** The framework can identify not only what is present in a text but also what is conspicuously absent. The analysis of a speech by Bernie Sanders, for instance, found no evidence for the `pragmatism` dimension, scoring it at 0.0. This statistical finding, supported by the note that **""** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt) could be found, suggests a rhetorical style that systematically avoids acknowledging complexity or trade-offs, which is itself a key insight into the speaker's strategy.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description
This analysis employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. Rooted in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory, the CAF assesses the virtues and vices speakers demonstrate through their rhetoric. It is structured around five fundamental, oppositional axes, each representing a tension between a civic virtue and its corresponding vice:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `dignity` vs. `tribalism`
2.  **Epistemic Axis:** `truth` vs. `manipulation`
3.  **Justice Axis:** `justice` vs. `resentment`
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `hope` vs. `fear`
5.  **Reality Axis:** `pragmatism` vs. `fantasy`

For each of these ten dimensions, the analysis produces a `raw` score (intensity) and a `salience` score (emphasis), both on a scale from 0 to 1.

### 4.2 Corpus Description
The analysis was performed on a small pilot corpus consisting of eight documents. The specific corpus manifest was not available, so speaker identification was performed by parsing document filenames. The speakers identified in the corpus include John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, John Lewis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King. The documents represent a range of political speeches from different contexts and time periods.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints
The analysis involved several computational steps, executed via the functions provided in the experiment's statistical module.

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Standard descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) were calculated for all 20 raw and salience scores to provide an overview of the data distribution.
*   **Derived Metrics:** Two key sets of derived metrics were calculated as specified by the CAF.
    *   **Character Tension Indices:** For each axis, this metric quantifies strategic contradiction using the formula: `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`.
    *   **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI):** This is the primary summary metric, calculated as `(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`. It produces a normalized score from -1.0 (maximally vice-dominant) to +1.0 (maximally virtue-dominant).
*   **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for the 10 raw dimension scores to examine the relationships between rhetorical virtues and vices. This serves as a primary method for assessing the framework's construct validity.
*   **Archetypal Analysis:** A rule-based classification system, `analyze_character_coherence`, was applied to speaker profiles to categorize them into rhetorical patterns such as "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology" based on their CCI, mean tension, and virtue/vice scores.

### 4.4 Limitations
The primary limitation of this study is its **small sample size (N=8)**. Consequently, all findings should be interpreted as preliminary and suggestive, not as generalizable conclusions about the speakers or political discourse at large. The results serve as a proof-of-concept for the analytical method rather than a definitive empirical statement. Additionally, the analysis was constrained by the lack of a corpus manifest, which prevented validation by pre-defined rhetorical style (e.g., 'populist' vs. 'institutional'), as the `validate_framework_by_style` function returned an error.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics
An initial examination of the descriptive statistics across the 8 documents reveals the prevalence and variability of different rhetorical dimensions in this corpus. The mean scores indicate which themes were most common, while standard deviations highlight the degree of variation between speakers.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**
| Statistic | tribalism_raw | dignity_raw | manipulation_raw | truth_raw | resentment_raw | justice_raw | fear_raw | hope_raw | fantasy_raw | pragmatism_raw |
|:----------|--------------:|------------:|-----------------:|----------:|---------------:|------------:|---------:|---------:|------------:|----------------:|
| mean      | 0.513         | 0.575       | 0.338            | 0.663     | 0.706          | 0.625       | 0.463    | 0.550    | 0.200       | 0.587           |
| std       | 0.419         | 0.362       | 0.374            | 0.213     | 0.355          | 0.315       | 0.245    | 0.278    | 0.288       | 0.372           |
| min       | 0.000         | 0.000       | 0.000            | 0.300     | 0.000          | 0.000       | 0.100    | 0.100    | 0.000       | 0.000           |
| max       | 0.900         | 0.900       | 0.800            | 0.900     | 0.950          | 0.900       | 0.900    | 0.900    | 0.700       | 0.900           |

*Note: Table simplified to show only raw scores for brevity. Salience scores showed similar patterns.*

The data indicates that `resentment` (mean = 0.706) and `truth` (mean = 0.663) were the most consistently high-intensity dimensions used across the corpus. This suggests that grounding claims in factual-sounding arguments while simultaneously appealing to grievances is a common rhetorical strategy in this sample. In contrast, `fantasy` (mean = 0.200) was the least utilized dimension.

The dimensions with the highest standard deviations are `tribalism` (std = 0.419), `pragmatism` (std = 0.372), and `manipulation` (std = 0.374). This high variance suggests that these dimensions are key differentiators between speakers; some employ them heavily, while others avoid them entirely. This is a positive indicator for the framework's discriminatory power.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis
The derived metrics provide a more holistic view of each speaker's rhetorical character. The **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)** offers a single, powerful score for comparison, while the **Tension Indices** reveal strategic complexity and contradiction.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Profiles and Coherence Classification**
| Speaker                  | Civic Character Index (CCI) | Mean Tension | Pattern Classification  | Mean Virtue Raw | Mean Vice Raw |
|:-------------------------|----------------------------:|-------------:|:------------------------|----------------:|--------------:|
| john_mccain              | 0.805                       | 0.014        | Authentic Virtue        | 0.820           | 0.020         |
| cory_booker              | 0.502                       | 0.058        | Authentic Virtue        | 0.880           | 0.240         |
| mitt_romney              | 0.500                       | 0.042        | Authentic Virtue        | 0.720           | 0.180         |
| john_lewis               | 0.253                       | 0.020        | Virtue-Leaning          | 0.780           | 0.400         |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez | 0.005                       | 0.088        | Virtue-Leaning          | 0.620           | 0.540         |
| jd_vance                 | -0.275                      | 0.042        | Vice-Leaning            | 0.340           | 0.620         |
| bernie_sanders           | -0.394                      | 0.144        | Strategic Pathology     | 0.380           | 0.730         |
| steve_king               | -0.480                      | 0.074        | Strategic Pathology     | 0.260           | 0.820         |

The CCI scores reveal a clear hierarchy. John McCain's speech stands out as an exemplar of civic virtue (CCI = +0.805), characterized by extremely high mean virtue scores (0.820) and negligible vice scores (0.020). His classification as "Authentic Virtue" is supported by his low mean tension (0.014), indicating a coherent, non-contradictory message. This is exemplified in his rhetoric of unity and responsibility. As John McCain stated: **"we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), a direct rejection of resentment-based politics.

At the other end of the spectrum, Steve King (CCI = -0.480) and Bernie Sanders (CCI = -0.394) are classified as "Strategic Pathology." Their profiles are dominated by high mean vice scores (0.820 and 0.730, respectively). Sanders' profile is particularly noteworthy for its high `mean_tension` (0.144), the highest in the corpus. This suggests a complex strategy that blends strong appeals to vice with some appeals to virtue, creating rhetorical friction. For example, his speech combines a powerful `tribalism` narrative with a call for `justice`. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%"** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), immediately followed by a call to action: **"That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change"** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This juxtaposition of grievance and action is captured by the high tension score.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sits at the midpoint (CCI = +0.005), with nearly balanced mean virtue (0.620) and vice (0.540) scores. This balance results in a neutral CCI but a relatively high tension score (0.088), suggesting a rhetorically mixed and potentially contradictory style that the classification algorithm labels "Virtue-Leaning" but which borders on "Incoherent Messaging."

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis
The Pearson correlation matrix for the ten raw CAF dimensions provides critical insight into the framework's internal structure and the patterns of co-occurrence in rhetorical strategies. The results strongly validate the framework's oppositional design.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix of Raw CAF Dimension Scores (Selected Values)**
|             | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | pragmatism | resentment | fantasy |
|:------------|----------:|--------:|-------------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| **tribalism** | 1.000     | -0.809  | 0.908        | -0.760     | 0.797      | 0.723   |
| **dignity**   | -0.809    | 1.000   | -0.869       | 0.666      | -0.522     | -0.755  |
| **manipulation**| 0.908     | -0.869  | 1.000        | -0.910     | 0.606      | 0.889   |
| **pragmatism**| -0.760    | 0.666   | -0.910       | 1.000      | -0.508     | -0.934  |
| **resentment**| 0.797     | -0.522  | 0.606        | -0.508     | 1.000      | 0.482   |
| **fantasy**   | 0.723     | -0.755  | 0.889        | -0.934     | 0.482      | 1.000   |

Two clear meta-strategies, or rhetorical clusters, are visible:
1.  **The Vice Cluster:** `tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, and `fantasy` are all strongly and positively correlated with one another. The link between `tribalism` and `manipulation` (r = +0.908) is particularly strong, suggesting that rhetoric defining an "us vs. them" narrative is almost always accompanied by manipulative framing. This is evident in the Sanders speech, where the tribal framing of the "99% vs 1%" is paired with the manipulative, emotionally charged claim that the **"worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs"** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).
2.  **The Virtue Cluster:** `dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, and `pragmatism` (not all shown in the abbreviated table) are positively correlated. For example, `dignity` is positively correlated with `pragmatism` (r = +0.666).

The most important finding is the strong **negative correlation** between these two clusters. The relationship between `manipulation` and `pragmatism` is exceptionally strong (r = -0.910), as is the one between `fantasy` and `pragmatism` (r = -0.934). This indicates that these are mutually exclusive rhetorical choices in this corpus. A speaker employing fantasy-based, simplistic narratives is highly unlikely to also employ pragmatic, reality-based arguments. This oppositional relationship is the cornerstone of the CAF's theoretical validity.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights
The statistical patterns observed in this analysis align closely with the theoretical foundations of the Civic Analysis Framework. The framework is designed to measure tensions between competing values, and the correlation matrix provides strong, quantitative evidence that these tensions are real and structurally significant in political discourse.

The strongest correlations reveal practical rhetorical pairings. The near-perfect negative correlation between `pragmatism` and `fantasy` (r = -0.934) suggests a fundamental choice speakers make: either ground their discourse in acknowledged complexity and constraints or in simplified, idealized, or villain-centric narratives. We can see this choice in action by contrasting speakers. John McCain's speech is coded high in pragmatism, exemplified by his statement: **"These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This acknowledges difficulty and offers a practical path forward. In contrast, a speech high in fantasy, like that from Bernie Sanders, offers a simplified moral narrative: **"The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on"** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt), which denies the complex motivations of economic actors.

These patterns provide robust evidence for the framework's **construct validity**. The fact that dimensions designed to be oppositional (e.g., `dignity` vs. `tribalism`) are strongly negatively correlated (r = -0.809) indicates the framework is measuring what it purports to measure. The dimensions are not just labels; they correspond to statistically distinct and behaviorally opposed rhetorical signals.

An unexpected and powerful finding is the role of `pragmatism` as a central organizing virtue. It has the strongest negative correlations with the key vices of `manipulation` (r = -0.910) and `fantasy` (r = -0.934). This suggests that the simple act of acknowledging complexity and constraints may be one of the most powerful antidotes to civically vicious rhetoric.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment
Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 demonstrates considerable effectiveness, though with noted limitations.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully discriminated between the eight speakers, generating a wide range of scores on the CCI and identifying unique "character profiles" for each. The high standard deviation on key dimensions like `tribalism` and `pragmatism` further supports this.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The framework appears well-suited to this corpus of American political speech, as it effectively captured the populist, institutional, and conciliatory styles present. The concepts of `resentment`, `tribalism`, and `dignity` are clearly relevant and measurable within this context.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The calculation of the CCI and Tension Indices proved highly insightful. The CCI provides an accessible summary, while the Tension Indices add a layer of nuance, preventing an overly simplistic "good vs. bad" interpretation by highlighting strategic complexity. The failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function underscores a critical dependency: the framework's full potential can only be realized with a well-curated corpus that includes rich metadata.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Theoretical Implications
This analysis, while preliminary, has several theoretical implications for the study of political communication. The strong statistical evidence for two opposing rhetorical meta-strategies—one rooted in virtue and the other in vice—suggests that civic character is not just a normative ideal but an empirically observable structure in language. The CAF provides a vocabulary and a methodology to measure this structure. The data indicates that political discourse may be less of a free-form art and more of a structured choice between two coherent, but mutually antagonistic, rhetorical systems.

The central role of `pragmatism` as an inverse correlate of vice is particularly significant. It suggests that the rejection of complexity is a gateway to civically damaging rhetoric. This finding implies that efforts to improve civic discourse might fruitfully focus on promoting and rewarding pragmatic communication that acknowledges trade-offs and uncertainty, rather than focusing solely on combating specific vices like tribalism.

### 6.2 Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns
The analysis allows for the identification of distinct rhetorical archetypes within the corpus:

1.  **The Institutional Unifier (Authentic Virtue):** Represented by John McCain's concession speech. This archetype is defined by a very high CCI, extremely low tension, and a near-total absence of vice. The rhetoric is characterized by appeals to `dignity`, `truth`, and `pragmatism`. The goal is to reinforce institutional norms and promote social cohesion, even in defeat. As John McCain stated: **"This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), an explicit act of recognizing the dignity of a broader community.

2.  **The Populist Agitator (Strategic Pathology):** Represented by Bernie Sanders and Steve King. This archetype has a strongly negative CCI and is dominated by the vice cluster: `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `manipulation`. It functions by creating a clear in-group/out-group dynamic, articulating a powerful sense of grievance, and simplifying complex problems into moral failings of the out-group. The high tension score for Sanders suggests this style can be sophisticated, weaving in appeals to `justice` and `hope` to legitimize its core message of resentment.

3.  **The Principled Contender (Virtue-Leaning):** Represented by Cory Booker and Mitt Romney. This archetype scores positively on the CCI but shows more evidence of vice and tension than the Unifier. These speakers primarily use the language of virtue but engage more directly in partisan conflict, leading to higher scores in dimensions like `resentment` or `fear` alongside high scores in `justice` and `dignity`.

4.  **The Ideological Pugilist (Ambivalent):** Represented by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This archetype is characterized by a CCI near zero and high tension. The speaker simultaneously uses strong virtue-based language (e.g., high `justice`, `hope`) and strong vice-based language (e.g., high `tribalism`, `resentment`). The resulting message is rhetorically charged but civically ambivalent, pulling in opposite directions.

### 6.3 Limitations and Future Directions
The most significant limitation is the small sample size (N=8), which prevents generalization. The findings from this pilot study must be tested on a large, diverse, and longitudinal corpus of political texts.

Future research should proceed in several directions:
*   **Corpus Expansion:** A larger corpus would allow for more robust statistical testing and the analysis of trends over time or across different political cultures.
*   **Metadata Integration:** A corpus with rich metadata (speaker party, speech context, audience, rhetorical style) is essential. This would enable the `validate_framework_by_style` analysis, which could test hypotheses such as whether populist rhetoric consistently scores higher on `tribalism` and `fantasy`.
*   **Temporal Analysis:** A longitudinal corpus could track the evolution of a single speaker's civic character over their career or map broader shifts in the civic character of a political system over time.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Future studies could investigate whether CCI scores or specific character profiles correlate with or predict real-world outcomes, such as electoral success, legislative effectiveness, or levels of political polarization.

## 7. Conclusion
This computational analysis demonstrates the significant potential of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 as a tool for the rigorous, quantitative study of political discourse. Despite the limitations of a small pilot corpus, the framework proved effective at differentiating speakers, quantifying their rhetorical choices, and revealing the underlying structural relationships between civic virtues and vices.

The analysis provides strong preliminary validation for the framework's core theoretical assumptions. The clear, oppositional structure of the virtue and vice clusters, as revealed in the correlation matrix, suggests that the CAF is measuring a meaningful and coherent phenomenon. The identification of distinct rhetorical archetypes, from the "Institutional Unifier" to the "Populist Agitator," illustrates the framework's capacity to translate quantitative scores into qualitatively rich, interpretable profiles. The findings suggest that the health of civic discourse can be measured, compared, and analyzed with a new level of scientific precision. This research warrants further investigation with larger datasets to confirm these indicative patterns and explore their broader implications for democratic governance.
