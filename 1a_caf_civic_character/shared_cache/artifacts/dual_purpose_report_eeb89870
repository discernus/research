### Executive Summary

This report details the results of an analysis applying the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.3 to a corpus of eight political texts from distinct speakers. The objective was to assess the framework's capacity to differentiate character patterns, identify unique speaker signatures, and measure character coherence.

Descriptive analysis of the ten core character dimensions revealed substantial variation across speakers, supporting the framework's utility for differentiation. For example, `dignity_score` ranged from 0.20 to 0.90, while `tribalism_score` ranged from 0.05 to 0.90 [1]. Composite metrics also showed clear distinctions, with the `virtue_index` ranging from 0.24 to 0.86 and the `pathology_index` from 0.05 to 0.85 [2].

Correlation analysis confirmed key theoretical assumptions of the framework. As predicted, `dignity_score` and `tribalism_score` showed a strong negative correlation (r = -0.79), as did `pragmatism_score` and `fantasy_score` (r = -0.87) [3]. These results provide evidence for the structural validity of the framework's bipolar axes.

A primary limitation of this study is the sample size (n=1 document per speaker), which precludes statistical significance testing (e.g., ANOVA) for speaker differentiation. Findings related to speaker differences are therefore descriptive and should be interpreted accordingly.

### Collaborator Section

#### Claim: H1_dignity_speaker_diff
**Hypothesis:** The 10 CAF dimensions will show statistically significant differences between speakers.
*   **Testability:** This hypothesis is not statistically testable with the current dataset due to a sample size of n=1 for each speaker group.
*   **Results:** Descriptive statistics show marked differences in `dignity_score` across speakers. Scores ranged from a high of 0.90 (John McCain, Mitt Romney) to a low of 0.20 (J.D. Vance, Steve King) [2].
*   **Evidence:**
    *   "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [4]
    *   "we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own." [5]
    *   "It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, \"Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.\"" [6]

#### Claim: H1_tribalism_speaker_diff
**Hypothesis:** The 10 CAF dimensions will show statistically significant differences between speakers.
*   **Testability:** This hypothesis is not statistically testable due to a sample size of n=1 per speaker.
*   **Results:** Descriptive analysis indicates wide variation in `tribalism_score`. Four speakers scored 0.90 (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, J.D. Vance, Steve King), while John McCain scored 0.05 [2].
*   **Evidence:**
    *   "But my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country. I'm a senator for the state of Ohio. Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country." [7]
    *   "They want us to think that our lives are suffering because of the LGBT kid down the street or because of the mixed status family or the dreamer down the block who's just trying to make a better life for themselves. But we're smarter than that Greeley." [8]
    *   "The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others." [9]

#### Claim: H2_signature_mccain
**Hypothesis:** Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices.
*   **Testability:** This hypothesis is testable through descriptive analysis of individual profiles.
*   **Results:** The data for John McCain reveals a distinct character signature characterized by a high `virtue_index` (0.83) and a very low `pathology_index` (0.05) [2].
*   **Evidence:**
    *   "His success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving." [10]
    *   "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [4]

#### Claim: H2_signature_vance
**Hypothesis:** Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices.
*   **Testability:** This hypothesis is testable through descriptive analysis of individual profiles.
*   **Results:** The data for J.D. Vance shows a contrasting signature, with a low `virtue_index` (0.24) and a high `pathology_index` (0.78) [2].
*   **Evidence:**
    *   "And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people." [11]
    *   "This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American." [12]
    *   "They want us to think that our lives are suffering because of the LGBT kid down the street or because of the mixed status family or the dreamer down the block who's just trying to make a better life for themselves. But we're smarter than that Greeley." [8]

#### Claim: H2_signature_aoc
**Hypothesis:** Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices.
*   **Testability:** This hypothesis is testable through descriptive analysis of individual profiles.
*   **Results:** The profile for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez demonstrates a mixed character signature, with both a high `virtue_index` (0.70) and a high `pathology_index` (0.80), indicating the strategic use of both virtuous and pathological appeals [2].
*   **Evidence:**
    *   "It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, \"Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.\"" [6]
    *   "If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here." [13]

#### Claim: H3_cci_variation
**Hypothesis:** MC-SCI scores will vary meaningfully between speakers, indicating different levels of character coherence.
*   **Testability:** This hypothesis is not statistically testable, but descriptive variation can be examined.
*   **Results:** The `civic_character_index`, which measures character coherence, shows a wide descriptive range across the eight speakers, from a minimum of 0.23 to a maximum of 0.89 [1]. This variation suggests the framework is capturing different levels of coherence in the analyzed texts.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." [4]
    *   "When here in our Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Article one of our Constitution says, \"All legislative power, power, all legislative, all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.\" That's here. The House and the Senate." [14]

#### Claim: framework_dignity_tribalism_corr
**Hypothesis:** Exploratory
*   **Testability:** This claim is testable via correlation analysis.
*   **Results:** A Pearson correlation analysis of the ten core dimensions revealed a strong negative correlation between `dignity_score` and `tribalism_score` (r = -0.79) [3]. This supports the framework's theoretical construction of the Identity Axis as a bipolar construct.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   "It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, \"Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect.\"" [6]
    *   "we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own." [5]

#### Claim: framework_pragmatism_fantasy_corr
**Hypothesis:** Exploratory
*   **Testability:** This claim is testable via correlation analysis.
*   **Results:** The analysis found a strong negative correlation between `pragmatism_score` and `fantasy_score` (r = -0.87) [3]. This result provides evidence for the validity of the Reality Axis as a bipolar construct within the framework.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   "to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity" [15]
    *   "But, Greeley, that means our communities choosing and voting for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class." [16]
    *   "So if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve." [17]

#### Claim: framework_virtue_pathology_relationship
**Hypothesis:** Exploratory
*   **Testability:** This claim is testable via correlation analysis.
*   **Results:** The correlation matrix shows a strong negative relationship between dimensions from different axes, such as `pragmatism_score` (a virtue) and `tribalism_score` (a pathology), with a Pearson correlation of r = -0.84 [3]. This suggests systematic relationships between virtue and pathology constructs across the framework.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   "But, Greeley, that means our communities choosing and voting for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class." [16]
    *   "And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, I imagine that many of them are very good people." [11]
