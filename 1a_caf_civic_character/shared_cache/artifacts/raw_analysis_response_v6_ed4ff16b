    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the dominant rhetorical framing of the speech, which is a class-based 'us vs. them' narrative. This is reflected in high scores for Tribalism, Resentment, and Manipulation. Virtuous dimensions like Dignity, Justice, and Hope are present but are secondary or serve as a concluding call to action rather than being the core of the argument. Pragmatism is notably absent, replaced by a simplified, moralistic framing that scores high on Fantasy."
