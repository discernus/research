    "analysis_notes": "Analysis of John Lewis's 1963 March on Washington speech focusing on inherent virtues and vices as defined by the CAF v10.0 framework. The speech clearly articulates grievances (Resentment), calls for fundamental fairness (Justice), and highlights dangers (Fear), while simultaneously projecting a powerful vision of change (Hope) and demanding concrete, realistic solutions (Pragmatism). Tribalism is present in the 'us vs. them' framing of the struggle, but it is in service of universal Dignity."
