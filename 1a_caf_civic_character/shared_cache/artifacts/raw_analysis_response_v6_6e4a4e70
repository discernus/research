    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on a political speech characterized by a strong populist, class-based 'us vs. them' narrative. The speaker uses data and statistics (Truth) to fuel a sense of grievance and blame (Resentment) against an 'oligarchy' (Tribalism), while framing the ultimate goal as a fight for a fair system (Justice). The rhetoric leverages threats of destruction (Fear) but concludes with a call for collective action and a better future (Hope)."
