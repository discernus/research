It analyzes the moral character displayed by speakers, based on Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. The framework evaluates what civic virtues and vices speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices, focusing on the fundamental tensions between competing values.\n\n**What problem does it solve?**\nDemocratic governance depends on civic discourse that embodies fundamental virtues. However, political communication often involves strategic tensions where speakers simultaneously appeal to competing virtues and their pathological counterparts. This framework provides a rigorous methodology for evaluating these tensions and assessing the overall civic character of political discourse. It moves beyond simple sentiment analysis to quantify the moral coherence of a speaker's communication.\n\n**Who is it for?**\nThis framework is designed for researchers, journalists, educators, and citizens who need to assess the moral fitness and integrity of political leaders. It is applicable to political speeches, debates, interviews, and other forms of public communication where a speaker's character is revealed.\n\n### Section 2: Theoretical & Empirical Foundations\n\nThe CAF is grounded in a multi-disciplinary body of research from political philosophy, virtue ethics, and political communication theory.\n\n#### **Aristotelian Virtue Ethics in a Political Context**\nDrawing from Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*, CAF recognizes that excellence in public life depends on the cultivation of specific virtues and the habitual avoidance of corresponding vices. Political leadership requires not merely policy competence but demonstrated moral character worthy of democratic trust. The framework operationalizes this by measuring the observable rhetorical habits of speakers.\n\n**Core Principle**: Character is revealed through choices under pressure. How leaders communicate when facing political challenges reveals their fundamental moral orientation.\n\n#### **Civic Republican Character Theory**\nBuilding on contemporary scholarship by figures like Michael Sandel and Philip Pettit, CAF examines how speakers either embody the civic virtues necessary for democratic leadership or display vices that undermine their fitness for public trust.\n\n**Key Insight**: Democratic governance depends on leaders who prioritize universal principles over narrow interests, demonstrate intellectual integrity, and maintain commitment to democratic norms even when politically costly.\n\n#### **The Importance of Salience Weighting**\nA core innovation of the v10 specification is the distinction between a dimension's **intensity** (its raw 0.0-1.0 score) and its **salience** (its rhetorical prominence or emphasis, also 0.0-1.0). This is empirically grounded in research showing that context-dependent weighting based on textual emphasis provides more accurate results than fixed weighting schemes (Laver et al., 2003). By analyzing both intensity and salience, CAF captures not just *what* is being said, but *how much emphasis* it receives, providing a more nuanced and valid assessment.\n\n**Key Citations**:\n- Aristotle. *Nicomachean Ethics*.\n- Sandel, M.

Each of the ten dimensions is scored independently for both intensity (raw_score) and rhetorical prominence (salience).\n\n**Dimensions & Axes**:\n\n**Identity Axis**: \n-   **Tribalism** (0.0-1.0): Group loyalty over universal principles, us-vs-them framing.\n-   **Dignity** (0.0-1.0): Respect for universal human worth, emphasis on shared humanity.\n\n**Truth Axis**:\n-   **Manipulation** (0.0-1.0): Strategic distortion of information, emotional manipulation.\n-   **Truth** (0.0-1.0): Commitment to factual accuracy, intellectual honesty.\n\n**Justice Axis**:\n-   **Resentment** (0.0-1.0): Exploitation of grievances, blame-focused rhetoric.\n-   **Justice** (0.0-1.0): Concern for fair outcomes, procedural fairness.\n\n**Emotional Axis**:\n-   **Fear** (0.0-1.0): Anxiety-inducing rhetoric, threat-focused language.\n-   **Hope** (0.0-1.0): Constructive optimism, positive vision for the future.\n\n**Reality Axis**:\n-   **Fantasy** (0.0-1.0): Unrealistic promises, magical thinking, oversimplified solutions.\n-   **Pragmatism** (0.0-1.0): Realistic problem-solving, acknowledgment of constraints.\n\n**Interpretive Guidance: Pattern Classifications**\nWhile not calculated as formal metrics, the synthesis agent should be guided by the following interpretive patterns to assess the overall character profile. These patterns emerge from the relationships between dimensional scores and salience.\n- **Authentic Virtue**: High scores and high salience for virtue dimensions, indicating a genuine commitment to civic ideals.\n- **Strategic Virtue Signaling**: High scores but low salience for virtue dimensions, suggesting superficial appeals without substantive commitment.\n- **Strategic Pathology**: High scores and high salience for vice dimensions, indicating a deliberate deployment of divisive or manipulative rhetoric.\n- **Incoherent Messaging**: High tension scores between opposing dimensions, indicating inconsistent or contradictory value appeals.\n\n**Derived & Composite Metrics**:\n\n**Character Tension Indices** (0.0-1.0, higher = more contradiction):\nThese metrics, restored from CAF v5.0, quantify the strategic contradictions in a speaker's rhetoric. They are now salience-weighted to reflect the prominence of the competing appeals.\n- **Formula**: `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`\n- **Indices**: `identity_tension`, `truth_tension`, `justice_tension`, `emotional_tension`, `reality_tension`.\n\n**Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index** (-1.0 to +1.0, negative = vice-dominant, positive = virtue-dominant):\nThis is the primary summary metric, calculating the overall character orientation of the discourse. It weights each dimension by its rhetorical prominence.\n- **Formula**: The sum of all (Virtue Score * Virtue Salience) minus the sum of all (Vice Score * Vice Salience), normalized by the total salience of all dimensions. This ensures that the most emphasized themes have the greatest impact on the final character assessment.\n\n**Sequential Analysis Strategy**:\nFor highest fidelity analysis, it is recommended to run the five sequential analysis variants (sequential_identity, sequential_truth, sequential_justice, sequential_emotional, sequential_reality) and combine the results. This approach allows the analysis agent to focus exclusively on one axis at a time, reducing cognitive load and improving scoring accuracy. The combined results provide a comprehensive character profile with enhanced reliability.\n\n**Concept Overlap Resolution**:\nThe framework addresses the inherent complexity of political discourse where speakers may simultaneously appeal to competing values. Each dimension includes explicit disambiguation rules to guide consistent scoring when conceptual overlap occurs:\n\n- **Identity Axis**: When statements refer to in-group dignity (e.g., \"respect for our citizens\"), the agent assesses whether the primary function is to create exclusionary contrast (Tribalism) or emphasize universal worth (Dignity). Both can be scored if clearly present.\n\n- **Truth Axis**: Distinguishes between strategic deception (Manipulation) and genuine intellectual honesty (Truth). A statement can be factually correct but manipulative if framed deceptively.\n\n- **Justice Axis**: Separates punitive blame-focus (Resentment) from restorative fairness (Justice). Both may use \"fairness\" language, so the agent evaluates temporal focus and intent.\n\n- **Emotional Axis**: Allows independent scoring of Fear and Hope, recognizing that speakers can simultaneously warn of threats while offering positive vision.\n\n- **Reality Axis**: Distinguishes between acknowledging constraints (Pragmatism) and denying complexity (Fantasy). Bold plans are Hope, not Fantasy, if grounded in plausible achievement paths.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that the framework captures the full complexity of political rhetoric while maintaining scoring consistency and reliability.\n\n**Machine-Readable Implementation**: The YAML appendix uses structured object formats to enhance LLM agent performance:\n\n- **Enhanced Markers**: Each dimension's `markers` section uses `{ phrase: \"...\", explanation: \"...\" }` objects instead of simple lists. This provides context for each example, helping agents understand why specific phrases indicate particular dimensions.\n\n- **Structured Disambiguation**: The `disambiguation` sections use nested objects with `rule`, `context_clues`, `priority`, and `co_occurrence_strategy` keys. This formal structure reduces ambiguity and ensures consistent agent interpretation of complex conceptual overlaps.\n\nThese structured formats exceed the base specification requirements but significantly improve scoring accuracy and reliability by providing explicit guidance for boundary cases and concept resolution.\n\n### Section 4: Intended Application & Corpus Fit\n\n-   **Target Corpus Description**: CAF is designed for the analysis of persuasive or strategic communication where a speaker's character is a central element, such as political speeches, candidate debates, and public statements.\n-   **Known Limitations & Scope**: The framework is less suited for analyzing purely informational texts, policy documents, or artistic works. It requires a text where a speaker is actively making choices that reveal their moral and civic orientation.\n-   **Model Requirements**: This framework requires a highly capable LLM model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) for reliable analysis due to the nuanced distinctions between dimensions and the dual-track intensity/salience scoring.\n-   **System Validation Note**: Be aware that the Discernus platform will perform a post-hoc statistical analysis of your framework's fit with your chosen corpus based on the variance in the results. A low framework-corpus fit score may indicate that the framework was misapplied and could impact the interpretation of the results.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: The Machine-Readable Appendix\n```yaml\n# --- Start of Machine-Readable Appendix ---\n\n# 5.1: Metadata\nmetadata:\n  framework_name: \"civic_analysis_framework\"\n  framework_version: \"1.0.0\"\n  author: \"Discernus Project\"\n  spec_version: \"10.0\"\n\n# 5.2: Analysis Variants\nanalysis_variants:\n  default:\n    description: \"Complete v10.0 implementation with salience and tension analysis.
