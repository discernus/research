    "analysis_notes": "The analyzed document is a political speech characterized by a strong bifurcation of topics. The first half presents a constitutional argument against a presidential nomination, while the second half transitions into a highly emotional appeal regarding immigration, using graphic anecdotes. The scoring reflects the dominance of fear, resentment, and tribalism, particularly in the second, more salient half of the speech. These themes are contrasted with appeals to the 'truth' of the constitution and the 'justice' of the rule of law, creating significant rhetorical tension."
