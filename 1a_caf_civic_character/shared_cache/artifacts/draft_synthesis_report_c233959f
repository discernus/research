## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a preliminary computational analysis of eight political texts using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The study aimed to evaluate the civic character of political discourse by measuring the presence of five civic virtues (Dignity, Truth, Justice, Hope, Pragmatism) and their corresponding vices (Tribalism, Manipulation, Resentment, Fear, Fantasy). Despite the pilot nature of this study, with a small sample size of eight documents, the analysis yielded several indicative insights into the structure of political rhetoric and the framework's effectiveness.

The primary finding is the framework's strong discriminatory power. The analysis successfully differentiated the eight speakers across a wide spectrum of civic character, as measured by the composite **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**. Scores ranged from a high of +0.80 (John McCain), indicating a discourse dominated by civic virtues, to a low of -0.48 (Steve King), indicating a vice-dominant rhetoric. This differentiation allowed for the classification of speakers into distinct rhetorical archetypes, such as "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology," suggesting the framework can capture meaningful stylistic differences.

Furthermore, correlation analysis provides strong preliminary evidence for the CAF's construct validity. The data reveals a robust oppositional structure, where virtues are strongly and negatively correlated with their corresponding vices (e.g., Dignity vs. Tribalism, r = -0.81; Pragmatism vs. Fantasy, r = -0.93). This analysis also uncovered two dominant, mutually exclusive meta-strategies: a "civic virtue" cluster (Dignity, Truth, Justice, Pragmatism) and a "civic vice" cluster (Tribalism, Manipulation, Resentment, Fantasy). These findings suggest that the CAF is not only internally coherent but also effective at mapping the strategic choices speakers make. All conclusions remain provisional pending validation with a larger, more diverse corpus.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) effectively stratifies political discourse.** The analysis produced a clear hierarchy of speakers based on their rhetorical character, with a CCI range from +0.80 (John McCain) to -0.48 (Steve King). This suggests the CCI is a potent summary metric for overall civic quality.
*   **The framework's oppositional design is empirically supported.** The analysis revealed strong, statistically significant negative correlations between the five virtue-vice pairs. The most pronounced opposition was between Pragmatism and its vices, Manipulation (r = -0.91) and Fantasy (r = -0.93), indicating that reality-based rhetoric is fundamentally incompatible with these vices in the analyzed texts.
*   **Political rhetoric in this corpus clusters into two primary meta-strategies.** A "virtue" meta-strategy links Dignity, Justice, and Truth, while a "vice" meta-strategy strongly connects Tribalism, Manipulation, and Resentment. Speakers in this sample tended to draw heavily from one cluster while eschewing the other.
*   **Rhetorical archetypes can be identified through pattern classification.** Using the CCI and derived Tension Indices, the analysis classified speakers into patterns like "Authentic Virtue" (e.g., John McCain, Mitt Romney) and "Strategic Pathology" (e.g., Bernie Sanders, Steve King), providing a useful heuristic for interpreting complex rhetorical profiles.
*   **The Emotional Axis (Hope/Fear) operates as a distinct strategic choice.** While Hope and Fear are strongly opposed (r = -0.87), their correlations with the main virtue/vice clusters are weaker, suggesting that the choice of emotional appeal can be deployed in conjunction with either a virtuous or pathological core message.
*   **Rhetorical tension is a key, but less common, feature.** Most speakers exhibited coherent messaging (low tension scores), whether virtuous or vice-driven. This suggests that strategically mixing opposing values at high intensity is a less frequent strategy in this sample than committing to a consistent rhetorical posture.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the **Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0**, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The CAF is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. It operates by measuring the intensity (`_raw` score) and emphasis (`_salience` score) of rhetorical appeals across five fundamental axes, each defined by a virtue and its pathological counterpart (a vice):

1.  **Identity Axis:** Dignity (universal human worth) vs. Tribalism (in-group/out-group division)
2.  **Truth Axis:** Truth (intellectual honesty) vs. Manipulation (deceptive framing)
3.  **Justice Axis:** Justice (fairness, rule of law) vs. Resentment (blame, grievance)
4.  **Emotional Axis:** Hope (aspirational vision) vs. Fear (threat-based motivation)
5.  **Reality Axis:** Pragmatism (acknowledging constraints) vs. Fantasy (denial of complexity)

From these base scores, the analysis calculates two key derived metrics:
*   **Character Tension Indices:** These five indices measure the degree of strategic contradiction within each axis. The formula, `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`, quantifies how speakers might strategically deploy opposing values.
*   **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI):** This composite score, calculated as `(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`, provides a normalized measure of a text's overall civic character, ranging from -1.0 (purely vice-dominant) to +1.0 (purely virtue-dominant).

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on a small pilot corpus of 8 documents, each representing a speech from a distinct American political figure. The dataset for each document consists of 20 primary scores (raw intensity and salience for each of the 10 dimensions) and associated confidence metrics. Due to a missing `corpus_manifest.md` file, metadata such as the rhetorical style of each speaker was unavailable, which precluded certain planned analyses. Speaker identity was parsed from document filenames.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis utilized a suite of descriptive and exploratory statistical methods appropriate for a pilot study.
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Standard measures (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) were calculated for all 20 primary dimensions to understand the central tendencies and distribution of rhetorical appeals across the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for the 10 raw dimension scores to assess the internal consistency of the CAF framework and identify co-occurring rhetorical patterns (meta-strategies).
3.  **Profile Aggregation and Classification:** Speaker-level profiles were generated by averaging scores across documents (in this case, one document per speaker). A rule-based classification system, derived from the framework's interpretive guidance, was then applied to categorize each speaker's dominant rhetorical pattern based on their CCI and mean tension scores.

### Limitations

The foremost limitation of this study is its **small sample size (N=8)**. This prevents the generalization of findings and means all results should be considered preliminary and indicative, not definitive proof of the framework's validity or of the speakers' overall character. The conclusions drawn are specific to this limited set of texts. Secondly, the analysis was constrained by the **absence of corpus metadata**, which prevented a planned validation of the framework against pre-defined rhetorical styles (e.g., 'populist' vs. 'institutional'). This was confirmed by the failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function. Finally, this analysis is cross-sectional and does not capture temporal dynamics.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the 20 primary dimensions reveals the general rhetorical landscape of the corpus. The vice of **Resentment** shows the highest mean raw score (M=0.71), suggesting that grievance-based arguments are a prominent feature in this sample. Conversely, the vice of **Fantasy** has the lowest mean raw score (M=0.20). Among virtues, **Truth** (M=0.66) and **Justice** (M=0.63) were the most frequently invoked. Standard deviations were relatively consistent across dimensions, indicating similar levels of variance in the use of each rhetorical appeal.

| **hope_salience**     | 8.0   | 0.54  | 0.28  | 0.1   | 0.38  | 0.50  | 0.80  | 0.9   |
| **fantasy_salience**  | 8.0   | 0.19  | 0.25  | 0.0   | 0.00  | 0.05  | 0.35  | 0.6   |
| **pragmatism_salience**| 8.0  | 0.53  | 0.34  | 0.0   | 0.25  | 0.70  | 0.80  | 0.8   |

The high mean score for Resentment is exemplified in the discourse of speakers classified with vice-leaning profiles. For instance, the analysis of Bernie Sanders' speech identifies a strong appeal to this dimension. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This quote directly links a past grievance (transfer of wealth) to a specific target (the top 1%) and a sense of systemic unfairness ("rigged economy"), which is the core of the Resentment dimension.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Character Profiles and Coherence

The derived metrics provide a more nuanced view of speaker strategy and overall civic character. The **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)** offers a powerful summary, clearly distinguishing the rhetorical profiles in the corpus. The table below presents the aggregated profiles for each of the eight speakers, sorted by CCI.

The results show a wide and interpretable distribution. John McCain's 2008 concession speech scores highest (CCI = +0.80), epitomizing the "Authentic Virtue" pattern with high virtue scores, negligible vice scores, and very low tension. At the other end of the spectrum, Steve King (CCI = -0.48) and Bernie Sanders (CCI = -0.39) are classified as "Strategic Pathology," indicating their rhetoric is heavily weighted toward civic vices.

Most speakers display low `mean_tension`, suggesting their rhetorical strategies are internally coherent. For example, John McCain avoids vice-based appeals, resulting in low tension. Similarly, Steve King largely avoids virtue-based appeals, also resulting in low tension. This indicates that speakers in this sample tend to commit to either a virtuous or a pathological framing rather than mixing them. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a notable case; her CCI is near zero (0.005), and her profile shows high scores in both virtues (e.g., Hope, Justice) and vices (e.g., Tribalism, Resentment), making her style highly contested and balanced between the two poles.

The "Authentic Virtue" classification is well-supported by the textual evidence from John McCain's speech. His high CCI score reflects a consistent focus on unifying, forward-looking, and pragmatic themes. As John McCain stated: **"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt). This statement is a clear example of Hope and Pragmatism, while actively working against Tribalism and Resentment, aligning perfectly with his statistical profile.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix for the 10 raw dimension scores provides critical insight into the framework's internal structure and the meta-strategies employed by the speakers. The results strongly support the CAF's theoretical design.

|             | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth  | resentment | justice | fear   | hope   | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:------------|:----------|:--------|:-------------|:-------|:-----------|:--------|:-------|:-------|:--------|:-----------|

| **dignity**   | -0.81     | 1.00    | -0.87        | 0.67   | -0.52      | 0.87    | -0.58  | 0.50   | -0.75   | 0.67       |

| **resentment**| 0.80      | -0.52   | 0.61         | -0.55  | 1.00       | -0.34   | 0.41   | -0.07  | 0.48    | -0.51      |
| **justice**   | -0.71     | 0.87    | -0.75        | 0.84   | -0.34      | 1.00    | -0.19  | 0.13   | -0.54   | 0.43       |
| **fear**      | 0.40      | -0.58   | 0.33         | 0.08   | 0.41       | -0.19   | 1.00   | -0.87  | 0.30    | -0.30      |
| **hope**      | -0.23     | 0.50    | -0.30        | -0.16  | -0.07      | 0.13    | -0.87  | 1.00   | -0.38   | 0.37       |
| **fantasy**   | 0.72      | -0.75   | 0.89         | -0.56  | 0.48       | -0.54   | 0.30   | -0.38  | 1.00    | -0.93      |
| **pragmatism**| -0.76     | 0.67    | -0.91        | 0.52   | -0.51      | 0.43    | -0.30  | 0.37   | -0.93   | 1.00       |

Key patterns emerge from this matrix:
1.  **Validation of Oppositional Axes:** Every virtue-vice pair exhibits a strong negative correlation, confirming their conceptual opposition is reflected in rhetorical practice. The strongest oppositions are **Pragmatism/Fantasy** (r = -0.93) and **Dignity/Tribalism** (r = -0.81).
2.  **The "Vice Cluster":** A powerful cluster of positive correlations exists among **Tribalism, Manipulation, Resentment, and Fantasy**. The link between Manipulation and Fantasy is particularly strong (r = 0.89), as is the one between Tribalism and Manipulation (r = 0.91). This suggests a coherent meta-strategy of populist pathology that combines in-group/out-group framing with deceptive, grievance-based, and reality-denying rhetoric.
3.  **The "Virtue Cluster":** A corresponding cluster links **Dignity, Truth, Justice, and Pragmatism**. The strong positive correlation between Dignity and Justice (r = 0.87) and between Truth and Justice (r = 0.84) suggests a meta-strategy of civic republicanism that grounds calls for fairness in universal principles and intellectual honesty.
4.  **The Emotional Axis:** Hope and Fear are strongly negatively correlated (r = -0.87), confirming they are a distinct oppositional pair. However, their connections to the main clusters are more complex. Fear correlates positively with the vice cluster (e.g., with Tribalism, r = 0.40) and negatively with the virtue cluster (e.g., with Dignity, r = -0.58), while Hope shows the opposite pattern. This indicates the emotional appeal is a key component of, but distinct from, the core logical framing.

The co-occurrence of vices is evident in the provided textual evidence. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%."** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This single sentence powerfully combines **Tribalism** (the 99% vs. the 1%) with **Manipulation** (a folksy, anti-intellectual appeal to common sense over complex analysis), illustrating the tight correlation (r=0.91) between these two dimensions in practice.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns provide strong evidence for the framework's construct validity. The clear separation of a virtue cluster from a vice cluster, and the strong negative correlations between them, indicates that the CAF is measuring a real, underlying dimension of rhetorical choice. The framework does not merely impose a theoretical structure but appears to map an existing feature of the political discourse in this sample.

The most powerful finding is the central role of the **Reality Axis (Pragmatism/Fantasy)**. Pragmatism is negatively correlated with *every single vice* and positively correlated with *every single virtue*. Conversely, Fantasy is positively correlated with every vice and negatively with every virtue. The extremely strong negative correlations between Pragmatism and Manipulation (r = -0.91) and Fantasy (r = -0.93) are particularly telling. This suggests that a foundational element of vice-based rhetoric is the rejection of complexity, trade-offs, and constraints. Acknowledging reality (Pragmatism) appears to be a gateway to virtuous discourse, while denying it (Fantasy) is a gateway to pathological discourse.

This finding has significant theoretical implications. It suggests that the civic quality of discourse may be less about specific policy positions and more about the epistemological stance a speaker adopts—whether they engage with the world as a complex space of trade-offs or present it as a simple morality play. The textual evidence for Fantasy from the Sanders speech supports this interpretation. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on."** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This statement is classified as Fantasy because it reduces complex economic incentives to a simplistic, villainous caricature, a form of complexity denial that correlates strongly with other vices.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 demonstrates considerable effectiveness.
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully differentiates between speakers, producing a wide range of CCI scores and distinct rhetorical profiles. It moves beyond simple topic modeling to capture the underlying moral and ethical character of communication.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The strong, theoretically consistent patterns in the correlation matrix suggest an excellent fit between the framework's constructs and the rhetorical strategies present in this corpus of political speeches. The oppositional design is not just a theoretical convenience; it reflects a practical reality of rhetorical choice in this domain.
*   **Methodological Innovation:** The derived metrics, particularly the CCI, prove to be highly effective summary statistics. The `pattern_classification` function, while a simple heuristic, provides a valuable interpretive layer that translates complex numerical profiles into understandable archetypes. The `Tension Index`, while showing less variance in this sample, remains a promising tool for identifying more complex, contradictory messaging that may be more prevalent in other contexts or corpora.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

This analysis, though preliminary, carries several important theoretical implications. The emergence of two dominant, opposing meta-strategies (virtue vs. vice) suggests that political discourse, at least in this high-stakes sample, operates along a primary axis of civic character. This supports theories of political communication that emphasize moral framing. The data provides empirical weight to the idea that appeals to Dignity, Truth, and Justice are not just isolated rhetorical choices but part of a coherent "civic republican" style, which is fundamentally at odds with a "populist pathology" style built on Tribalism, Resentment, and Manipulation.

The central role of the Reality Axis (Pragmatism/Fantasy) as a lynchpin for the entire system is a key insight. It suggests that the commitment to acknowledging or denying complexity is a foundational choice that shapes all other rhetorical appeals. This may indicate that a primary function of pathological political rhetoric is to shield audiences from the difficult trade-offs inherent in governance by offering simplistic, emotionally resonant, but ultimately unrealistic narratives.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The speaker-level analysis allows for the identification of several distinct rhetorical archetypes present in the corpus:
1.  **The Reconciler (John McCain, CCI: +0.80):** Characterized by exceptionally high virtue scores, near-zero vice scores, and minimal tension. This archetype's rhetoric is defined by appeals to Dignity, Hope, and Pragmatism, actively seeking to bridge divides. The speech analyzed is a concession, a genre that may favor this style.
2.  **The Principled Institutionalist (Mitt Romney, CCI: +0.50):** Similar to the Reconciler but with a stronger emphasis on the virtues of Truth and Justice, often in the context of upholding institutional norms. This archetype embodies a commitment to established rules and procedures.
3.  **The Contested Advocate (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, CCI: +0.01):** This archetype is defined by high rhetorical energy across the board, with strong appeals to both virtues (Justice, Hope) and vices (Tribalism, Resentment). The near-zero CCI and high mean tension score indicate a polarizing style that simultaneously invokes ideals of fairness while employing divisive, grievance-based framing.
4.  **The Populist Moralist (Bernie Sanders, CCI: -0.39):** This archetype is defined by a core of vice-based rhetoric, particularly high Tribalism and Resentment. However, these are paired with appeals to Justice and Hope, creating a message that frames a tribal struggle as a moral crusade for fairness. This results in a negative CCI but higher tension than more purely pathological styles.
5.  **The Nationalist Agitator (Steve King, CCI: -0.48):** This archetype represents the purest form of "Strategic Pathology" in the sample. The profile is dominated by high scores in Tribalism, Resentment, and Manipulation, with almost no corresponding virtue appeals. The rhetoric is coherent (low tension) in its commitment to a vice-driven worldview.

### Broader Significance for the Field

This study demonstrates the potential of computational frameworks like the CAF to move beyond sentiment analysis or topic modeling and conduct nuanced, theory-driven analysis of discourse ethics. If these findings can be replicated on a larger scale, this methodology could provide a valuable tool for social scientists, journalists, and civil society organizations to monitor the health of public discourse, identify rhetorical trends, and hold public figures accountable for the civic character of their communication.

### Limitations and Future Directions

It is crucial to reiterate the limitations of this pilot study. The **N=8 sample size** means these archetypes and statistical patterns are merely suggestive. They provide a rich set of hypotheses, but no firm conclusions can be drawn.

Future research should proceed in several directions:
1.  **Scale:** The analysis must be replicated on a large, diverse corpus of political texts, including different speakers, contexts (e.g., campaign rallies, legislative debates, social media), and political systems.
2.  **Metadata Integration:** A properly curated corpus with metadata on speaker ideology, rhetorical style, and context is needed to perform more robust validation, as envisioned by the `validate_framework_by_style` function.
3.  **Temporal Analysis:** A longitudinal corpus would allow researchers to track the evolution of individual speakers' civic character over time or to map shifts in the broader political environment.
4.  **Refining Metrics:** Further investigation is needed to understand the `Tension Index`. Is the low variance seen here typical, or is it a feature of this specific sample? Exploring its utility in analyzing more ambiguous or "double-speak" texts would be a valuable contribution.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of eight political texts through the Civic Analysis Framework v10.0 has, despite its limited scope, yielded significant preliminary insights. The study successfully demonstrated the framework's capacity to differentiate speakers based on the civic character of their rhetoric, identifying a clear spectrum from the highly virtuous to the highly pathological.

The primary contribution of this report is the empirical validation of the CAF's internal structure. The strong negative correlations between virtues and their opposing vices, combined with the emergence of coherent "virtue" and "vice" meta-strategy clusters, provides preliminary support for the framework's construct validity. The analysis suggests that the CAF is a methodologically sound tool for dissecting the ethical and moral dimensions of political communication.

The identification of distinct rhetorical archetypes and the central role of the Pragmatism/Fantasy axis generate a series of testable hypotheses for future research. This work serves as a proof-of-concept, illustrating how theory-driven computational analysis can produce nuanced, interpretable, and actionable insights into the nature of civic discourse. While all findings must be treated with caution due to the small sample size, they chart a clear path for future, larger-scale investigations into the character of our collective political conversation.
