    "analysis_notes": "The analyzed document is a highly rhetorical speech with a clear populist and anti-oligarchy message. The scoring reflects a strong emphasis on themes of economic justice and class-based grievance, which elevates the scores for dimensions like Justice, Resentment, and Tribalism. The speaker's primary strategy is to frame the political landscape as a struggle between the working class and a corrupt billionaire class, which makes these dimensions highly salient. Virtues like Dignity and Truth are present as justifications for this struggle. Vices like Fear and Fantasy are largely absent."
