{"experiment_summary": "This analysis plan outlines the mathematical operations to investigate main effects of political era and ideological affiliation on civic character dimensions, as well as inter-dimensional correlations. Due to the limitations of available statistical tools, the plan focuses on one-way ANOVA and independent t-tests for main effects, and correlation analysis. It does not include two-way ANOVA for interaction effects (H3, H5) or calculations involving the MC-SCI (H4), as these require tools not provided in the current set.", "tasks":
