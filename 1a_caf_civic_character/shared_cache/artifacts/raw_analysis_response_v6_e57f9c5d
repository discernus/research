The document is a highly principled and structured speech, making the scoring of dimensions like Justice, Truth, and Pragmatism relatively straightforward. The speaker's primary theme is the conflict between partisan loyalty (Tribalism) and his duty to his oath (Justice, Truth). Dimensions with a score of 0.0 reflect a complete absence of rhetorical evidence for that concept in the text."
