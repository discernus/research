# Speaker Character Pattern Analysis
Framework: Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.3
Run ID: [PLACEHOLDER]
Date: [PLACEHOLDER]

## Executive Summary

This experiment evaluated speaker differentiation and character patterns using the CAF framework across a corpus of political speeches. Key findings suggest potential speaker-specific character signatures, though statistical validation was limited by sample constraints. The framework demonstrated utility in identifying distinct virtue-vice patterns, particularly in justice and dignity dimensions. Primary limitations include small sample sizes and potential temporal bias across different speech eras.

## Collaborator Section

### H1: Speaker Differentiation
**Hypothesis**: The 10 CAF dimensions will show statistically significant differences between speakers
**Testability**: Not testable due to insufficient samples per speaker for ANOVA

Evidence suggests dimensional variation between speakers, particularly in truth and hope dimensions. For example, Cory Booker demonstrates high truth scores: "We know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied" [1]. This contrasts with hope-focused rhetoric: "Like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change" [2].

### H2: Character Signatures
**Hypothesis**: Each speaker will exhibit a unique character signature across the 5 virtues and 5 vices
**Testability**: Partially testable through pattern analysis, though statistical significance testing is limited

Evidence indicates distinct character patterns. Booker emphasizes justice: "We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all" [3]. AOC demonstrates high dignity scores: "If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here" [4].

### H3: MC-SCI Coherence
**Hypothesis**: MC-SCI scores will vary meaningfully between speakers, indicating different levels of character coherence
**Testability**: Not testable due to insufficient samples for statistical comparison

Limited evidence suggests variation in character coherence. Compare Booker's measured truth claims [5] with Sanders' more dramatic fantasy-oriented rhetoric: "They live in another planet. They own mansions all over the world" [6].

## Technical Transparency

Limitations:
- Insufficient samples per speaker for ANOVA testing
