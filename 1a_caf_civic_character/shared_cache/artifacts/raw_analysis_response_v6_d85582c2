    "analysis_notes": "The document is a highly impassioned and rhetorically dense speech from the Civil Rights era. It exhibits strong, often co-occurring, instances of both virtue and vice dimensions (e.g., high Resentment and high Justice; high Fear and high Hope). The analysis focused on distinguishing between describing a state (like fear) and using it as a primary rhetorical tool. The speaker's primary strategy is to voice grievances (Resentment) to demand systemic change (Justice), grounded in a pragmatic assessment of legislative shortfalls."
