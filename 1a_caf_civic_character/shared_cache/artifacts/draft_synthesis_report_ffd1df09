## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse, applying the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 to a corpus of eight significant political speeches. The analysis sought to quantify the use of civic virtues and vices, identify rhetorical patterns, and assess the overall character of each speaker's communication. The findings indicate that the CAF framework is highly effective at differentiating rhetorical styles and provides strong preliminary evidence for its theoretical constructs.

The analysis reveals a stark polarization of rhetorical character within the corpus. Speakers cluster into distinct archetypes, most notably "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology." The **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, a key derived metric, effectively quantifies this divide, with scores ranging from a high of +0.73 (John McCain) to a low of -0.60 (J.D. Vance). Speakers in the "Authentic Virtue" cluster (McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney) consistently employed rhetoric of `dignity`, `truth`, and `hope`, while minimizing divisive language. Conversely, the "Strategic Pathology" cluster (Vance, Bernie Sanders, Steve King) relied heavily on `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `fear`. This pattern is exemplified by the language of Bernie Sanders, who frames issues in stark oppositional terms, such as when he states, "I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).

The framework's internal consistency was strongly supported by correlation analysis. As theoretically predicted, virtues were positively inter-correlated, as were vices, while virtues and vices showed strong negative correlations. For instance, the virtue of `dignity` was almost perfectly inversely correlated with the vice of `manipulation` (r = -0.97). These results suggest the framework's dimensions capture coherent and opposing rhetorical strategies. While the small sample size (N=8) means these findings should be considered preliminary, they demonstrate the potential of the CAF to provide a nuanced, data-driven assessment of political discourse and generate testable hypotheses about the nature of civic communication.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) Effectively Stratifies Speakers:** The analysis produced a clear hierarchy of civic character, with the CCI metric ranging from +0.73 to -0.60. This single metric successfully differentiates speakers who primarily use unifying, virtue-based rhetoric (e.g., John McCain, CCI = +0.73) from those who employ divisive, vice-based rhetoric (e.g., J.D. Vance, CCI = -0.60).
*   **Two Dominant Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge:** The data reveals two primary, coherent rhetorical strategies. The "Authentic Virtue" archetype (McCain, Booker, Romney) is characterized by high scores in `dignity`, `truth`, and `hope`. The "Strategic Pathology" archetype (Vance, Sanders, King) is defined by high scores in `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `fear`.
*   **Framework's Oppositional Structure is Statistically Validated:** The correlation matrix provides strong evidence for the framework's theoretical design. Vices like `tribalism` and `resentment` are very strongly correlated (r = +0.96), while virtues like `dignity` are strongly negatively correlated with vices like `manipulation` (r = -0.97), confirming they represent opposing rhetorical choices.
*   **Pathological Rhetoric Relies on a "Tribalism-Resentment-Fear" Triad:** Speakers with the lowest CCI scores consistently build their rhetoric on a foundation of three interconnected vices. The data shows extremely high correlations between `tribalism` and `fear` (r = +0.97) and `tribalism` and `resentment` (r = +0.96). This is exemplified in the rhetoric of Bernie Sanders, who combines a tribal appeal to the "99%" with narratives of grievance, stating, "Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).
*   **Virtuous Rhetoric is Anchored by "Dignity-Truth-Pragmatism":** The highest-scoring speakers built their message around a core of civic virtues. The analysis shows strong positive correlations between `truth` and `pragmatism` (r = +0.94) and `dignity` and `justice` (r = +0.78). This pattern is illustrated by John McCain's concession speech, which received the highest CCI score. As McCain stated, "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans," a clear appeal to `dignity`, and "The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly," a direct acknowledgment of `truth` (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).
*   **Rhetorical Tension is Low, Suggesting Coherent Strategies:** The `Tension Indices`, designed to measure the use of contradictory messaging, were low across all speakers (mean tension scores ranged from 0.04 to 0.14). This indicates that speakers in this corpus generally adopt a coherent rhetorical posture, either consistently virtuous or consistently vice-driven, rather than attempting to appeal to opposing values simultaneously.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description
This analysis utilizes the **Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0**, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The framework is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. It assesses rhetoric across five fundamental, oppositional axes, each comprising a civic virtue and its corresponding vice:

*   **Identity Axis:** `Dignity` (appeals to universal humanity and shared identity) vs. `Tribalism` (in-group/out-group division).
*   **Truth Axis:** `Truth` (adherence to facts and reality) vs. `Manipulation` (distortion and emotional appeals over reason).
*   **Justice Axis:** `Justice` (appeals to fairness and due process) vs. `Resentment` (focus on grievance and retribution).
*   **Emotional Axis:** `Hope` (focus on positive, achievable futures) vs. `Fear` (focus on threats and anxieties).
*   **Reality Axis:** `Pragmatism` (acknowledgment of complexity and trade-offs) vs. `Fantasy` (oversimplification and denial of complexity).

For each of these 10 dimensions, the analysis generates a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1).

### 4.2 Corpus Description
The study was conducted on the **CAF Civic Character Political Speeches Corpus**, which contains 8 documents from prominent American political figures, with dates ranging from 1963 to 2025. While the initial metadata for speaker, party, and style was unavailable, speaker identities were successfully parsed from document filenames for the analysis. The speakers analyzed are: John Lewis, John McCain, Steve King, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, J.D. Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Derived Metrics
The analysis employed several statistical methods to extract insights from the raw dimensional scores.

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Standard measures (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) were calculated for all 20 raw and salience scores to understand the central tendencies and distribution of rhetorical features across the corpus.
*   **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was computed for the 10 raw dimension scores to examine the relationships between rhetorical choices and to assess the framework's internal construct validity.
*   **Derived Metrics:** Two key sets of metrics were calculated as specified by the CAF v10.0 framework:
    *   **Character Tension Indices:** For each of the five axes, a tension score was calculated using the formula: `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`. This metric quantifies strategic contradiction.
    *   **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI):** A single, holistic measure of civic character was computed using the formula: `CCI = (Sum(Virtue_Raw * Virtue_Salience) - Sum(Vice_Raw * Vice_Salience)) / Total_Salience`. This index ranges from +1.0 (purely virtuous) to -1.0 (purely vice-driven).
*   **Archetypal Analysis:** Based on the derived metrics, a rule-based classification was applied to categorize each speaker's dominant rhetorical pattern (e.g., "Authentic Virtue," "Strategic Pathology").

### 4.4 Analytical Constraints and Limitations
The findings of this report should be interpreted in light of several limitations:
1.  **Small Sample Size:** With a corpus of only eight documents (N=8), the results are preliminary and suggestive, not generalizable. The analysis demonstrates the framework's potential on a pilot scale.
2.  **Lack of External Metadata:** The analysis could not perform validation against external variables like rhetorical `style` (e.g., populist, institutional) due to its absence in the corpus manifest.
3.  **Sparse Textual Evidence:** The available textual evidence for citation was limited to two of the eight speakers (Bernie Sanders and John McCain). While this evidence is used to illustrate the quantitative findings, claims about the specific language of other speakers are based on their statistical profiles alone and should be treated with caution.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics
An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the 10 raw scores and 10 salience scores across all 8 documents reveals the baseline rhetorical tendencies in the corpus.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CAF Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**
| Statistic | dignity_raw | tribalism_raw | truth_raw | manipulation_raw | justice_raw | resentment_raw | hope_raw | fear_raw | pragmatism_raw | fantasy_raw |
|:----------|:-----------:|:-------------:|:---------:|:----------------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| **mean**  |    0.538    |     0.513     |   0.663   |       0.313      |    0.675    |      0.600     |  0.663   |  0.600   |      0.550     |    0.213    |
| **std**   |    0.378    |     0.409     |   0.267   |       0.405      |    0.276    |      0.417     |  0.213   |  0.278   |      0.293     |    0.280    |
| **min**   |    0.100    |     0.000     |   0.200   |       0.000      |    0.100    |      0.000     |  0.200   |  0.300   |      0.100     |    0.000    |
| **max**   |    0.900    |     0.900     |   0.900   |       0.800      |    0.900    |      0.900     |  0.900   |  0.900   |      0.800     |    0.700    |

*Note: Table shows raw scores for brevity; salience scores followed similar patterns.*

The virtues of `justice` (mean = 0.675), `truth` (mean = 0.663), and `hope` (mean = 0.663) were, on average, the most intensely used rhetorical dimensions in the corpus. This suggests that appeals to fairness, facts, and positive futures are common across different political styles. Conversely, `fantasy` (mean = 0.213) and `manipulation` (mean = 0.313) were the least utilized on average. The vices of `tribalism` (std = 0.409), `manipulation` (std = 0.405), and `resentment` (std = 0.417) show the highest standard deviations, indicating that their use varies dramatically between speakers, making them key differentiators of rhetorical character.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Character Profiles and Coherence

The derived metrics provide a more holistic view of each speaker's rhetorical character. The **Civic Character Index (CCI)** and the **Pattern Classification** reveal a clear and coherent stratification of the speakers.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Coherence and Archetypal Classification**
| speaker                  | civic_character_index | mean_tension | pattern_classification   | mean_virtue_raw | mean_vice_raw |
|:-------------------------|:---------------------:|:------------:|:-------------------------|:---------------:|:-------------:|
| john_mccain              |         0.734         |     0.036    | Authentic Virtue         |      0.780      |     0.060     |
| cory_booker              |         0.726         |     0.060    | Authentic Virtue         |      0.880      |     0.100     |
| mitt_romney              |         0.644         |     0.048    | Authentic Virtue         |      0.780      |     0.100     |
| john_lewis               |         0.289         |     0.064    | Virtue-Leaning           |      0.780      |     0.400     |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez |         0.020         |     0.106    | Virtue-Leaning           |      0.720      |     0.540     |
| steve_king               |        -0.334         |     0.094    | Strategic Pathology      |      0.460      |     0.840     |
| bernie_sanders           |        -0.461         |     0.138    | Strategic Pathology      |      0.320      |     0.760     |
| jd_vance                 |        -0.596         |     0.091    | Strategic Pathology      |      0.220      |     0.780     |

The results in Table 2 are striking. Three speakers—McCain, Booker, and Romney—form a distinct "Authentic Virtue" cluster with high CCI scores (> 0.64), high mean virtue scores (> 0.78), and very low mean vice scores (≤ 0.10). Their rhetoric, according to the model, is overwhelmingly characterized by civic virtues. The language used by John McCain exemplifies this cluster. His call to "find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences" is a hallmark of the `pragmatism` that contributes to his high CCI score (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

At the opposite end of the spectrum, King, Sanders, and Vance form a "Strategic Pathology" cluster with strongly negative CCI scores (< -0.33), high mean vice scores (> 0.76), and low mean virtue scores (< 0.46). Their rhetoric is defined by its reliance on civic vices. The statistical profile of these speakers is illustrated by the language of Bernie Sanders, who scores high on `fear` by warning that opponents "are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).

Two speakers, Lewis and Ocasio-Cortez, occupy a middle ground. Their CCI scores are near the center, reflecting a rhetorical style that blends strong appeals to virtue (mean virtue raw > 0.72) with significant use of vice (mean vice raw > 0.40). This suggests a more complex rhetorical strategy, possibly one of "righteous struggle," that combines calls for `justice` with high levels of `resentment`.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis
The Pearson correlation matrix for the 10 raw CAF dimensions provides powerful evidence for the framework's construct validity. The patterns of correlation align almost perfectly with the framework's theoretical design of oppositional virtues and vices.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix of CAF Raw Dimension Scores**
|             | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth  | resentment | justice | fear   | hope   | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:------------|:---------:|:-------:|:------------:|:------:|:----------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| **tribalism** |   1.00    | -0.70   |     0.76     | -0.70  |    0.96    | -0.59   |  0.97  | -0.63  |  0.75   |   -0.61    |
| **dignity**   |  -0.70    |  1.00   |    -0.97     |  0.78  |   -0.60    |  0.78   | -0.80  |  0.80  | -0.92   |    0.64    |
| **manipulation**|  0.76     | -0.97   |     1.00     | -0.83  |    0.63    | -0.83   |  0.84  | -0.77  |  0.96   |   -0.70    |
| **truth**     |  -0.70    |  0.78   |    -0.83     |  1.00  |   -0.62    |  0.91   | -0.75  |  0.35  | -0.64   |    0.94    |
| **resentment**|  0.96     | -0.60   |     0.63     | -0.62  |    1.00    | -0.45   |  0.89  | -0.55  |  0.62   |   -0.60    |
| **justice**   |  -0.59    |  0.78   |    -0.83     |  0.91  |   -0.45    |  1.00   | -0.69  |  0.44  | -0.66   |    0.79    |
| **fear**      |  0.97     | -0.80   |     0.84     | -0.75  |    0.89    | -0.69   |  1.00  | -0.72  |  0.83   |   -0.60    |
| **hope**      |  -0.63    |  0.80   |    -0.77     |  0.35  |   -0.55    |  0.44   | -0.72  |  1.00  | -0.90   |    0.17    |
| **fantasy**   |  0.75     | -0.92   |     0.96     | -0.64  |    0.62    | -0.66   |  0.83  | -0.90  |  1.00   |   -0.50    |
| **pragmatism**|  -0.61    |  0.64   |    -0.70     |  0.94  |   -0.60    |  0.79   | -0.60  |  0.17  | -0.50   |    1.00    |

Key findings from the correlation matrix:
*   **Strong Vice Clustering:** The vices `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `fear` are exceptionally highly correlated (r > +0.88), forming a coherent rhetorical triad. `Manipulation` and `fantasy` also form a pair (r = +0.96). This suggests that speakers who use one of these vices are highly likely to use the others in concert.
*   **Strong Virtue Clustering:** The virtues also cluster, though slightly less tightly. `Truth`, `justice`, and `pragmatism` are strongly inter-correlated (r > +0.79). `Dignity` and `hope` also show a strong positive relationship (r = +0.80).
*   **Validation through Opposition:** The most significant finding is the pattern of strong, negative correlations between virtues and vices, which validates the framework's oppositional design. The relationship between `dignity` and `manipulation` (r = -0.97) is nearly a perfect inverse relationship. Similarly, `hope` and `fantasy` are strongly opposed (r = -0.90). This indicates that these are not independent rhetorical choices but exist on a spectrum; a speaker emphasizing one necessarily de-emphasizes the other.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights
The correlation patterns reveal two powerful, opposing meta-strategies at play in the corpus.

1.  **The Civic Republican Meta-Strategy:** This strategy aligns with the "Authentic Virtue" archetype. It combines appeals to `dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, `hope`, and `pragmatism`. The strong positive correlation between `truth` and `pragmatism` (r = +0.94) is the cornerstone of this approach, suggesting a rhetoric grounded in reality and focused on workable solutions. This is exemplified by John McCain's pledge "to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face," which combines an acknowledgment of difficulty (`truth`) with a commitment to cooperation (`pragmatism`) (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

2.  **The Populist Pathological Meta-Strategy:** This strategy aligns with the "Strategic Pathology" archetype. It is built on the tightly-knit triad of `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `fear`. This approach defines a virtuous in-group ("the 99%") against a malevolent out-group ("the oligarchs"), stokes grievance over past injustices ("rigged economy"), and warns of future threats ("destroy Social Security"). The language of Bernie Sanders provides a clear illustration. His statement, "But I will tell you this, in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs," is a classic example of `manipulation` that simplifies a complex issue into a moral failing of a specific group, reinforcing the pathological cluster (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment
The analysis provides strong preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of the CAF v10.0 framework.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, particularly through the CCI, demonstrates high discriminatory power. It successfully separates speakers into statistically and conceptually distinct groups, moving beyond simple positive/negative sentiment to capture the specific moral character of their rhetoric.
*   **Construct Validity:** The correlation analysis serves as a robust test of the framework's construct validity. The results strongly support the theoretical oppositions (e.g., Dignity vs. Tribalism) and the conceptual groupings of virtues and vices.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The framework appears to be an excellent fit for this corpus of American political speeches, as it effectively maps the key rhetorical divisions present in the data. However, the analysis was unable to validate the framework against predefined rhetorical `style` categories, as the `validate_framework_by_style` function failed due to a lack of this metadata in the corpus. This remains a critical area for future validation efforts.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Theoretical Implications
The findings from this analysis carry significant theoretical implications for the study of political communication. The clear clustering of speakers into "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology" archetypes suggests that political discourse may not be a simple spectrum from positive to negative, but rather a contest between two coherent, yet mutually exclusive, moral-rhetorical systems. One system, rooted in civic republican ideals, emphasizes unity, reason, and pragmatic compromise. The other, rooted in populist anger, emphasizes division, grievance, and existential threat. The CAF framework provides a vocabulary and a quantitative methodology to identify and measure these competing systems.

The low `Tension` scores across the board are also theoretically interesting. They suggest that, in this sample, speakers are not typically "incoherent" or trying to be all things to all people. Instead, they commit to a specific rhetorical character. This challenges the notion that all political speech is a muddled mix of appeals, suggesting instead that speakers adopt and maintain a consistent rhetorical persona.

### 6.2 Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns
The analysis reveals at least three distinct rhetorical archetypes within this small corpus:

1.  **The Institutionalist (Authentic Virtue):** Represented by John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney, this archetype is defined by a high CCI score (>0.64). Their rhetoric is overwhelmingly virtuous, emphasizing `dignity`, `truth`, and `hope`. They avoid `tribalism` and `resentment`. This style appears to be focused on upholding institutional norms and fostering national unity. The language of John McCain, with its focus on being "fellow Americans" and finding "necessary compromises," is the quintessential example of this archetype in the dataset (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

2.  **The Populist (Strategic Pathology):** Represented by J.D. Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King, this archetype is defined by a strongly negative CCI score (<-0.33). Their rhetoric is built on a foundation of `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `fear`. While they may use words associated with virtue (e.g., `justice`), these are framed within a narrative of grievance and conflict. The statistical profile of this group is exemplified by Bernie Sanders' focus on a "rigged economy" and the "greed of the oligarchs," which scores high in `resentment` and `manipulation` (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).

3.  **The Activist (Virtue-Leaning/Contested):** Represented by John Lewis and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, this archetype has a CCI score near zero. This reflects a complex blend of high virtue scores (especially `justice` and `dignity`) and high vice scores (especially `resentment` and `tribalism`). This style seems to reflect a rhetoric of "righteous struggle," where strong appeals to universal principles of justice are paired with a clear identification of an oppressive out-group and a narrative of historical grievance.

### 6.3 Broader Significance and Future Directions
This pilot study demonstrates the potential for computational frameworks like the CAF to bring new rigor to the analysis of political discourse. By moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to a theoretically grounded model of civic character, such tools can help scholars, journalists, and citizens to better understand the moral underpinnings of political communication.

Future research should aim to overcome the limitations of this study. Key next steps include:
*   **Expanding the Corpus:** Applying the framework to a much larger and more diverse set of documents is essential to confirm the generalizability of these archetypes and correlation patterns.
*   **Temporal Analysis:** With a larger corpus spanning several decades, researchers could investigate how these rhetorical patterns have evolved over time. For instance, has the prevalence of the "Strategic Pathology" archetype increased in recent years?
*   **External Validation:** A crucial next step is to test the framework against a corpus with pre-labeled metadata for speaker ideology, party affiliation, and rhetorical style. This would allow for a robust test of whether the CAF's classifications align with established political science categories.
*   **Deeper Textual Integration:** Future work should pair this quantitative analysis with more robust qualitative evidence to ensure the statistical patterns are fully grounded in the nuances of language.

## 7. Conclusion
This computational analysis of eight political speeches using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 has yielded significant preliminary insights into the structure of civic discourse. The study successfully identified and quantified distinct rhetorical profiles, revealing a stark division between speakers who employ a rhetoric of "Authentic Virtue" and those who use "Strategic Pathology." The framework's primary derived metric, the Civic Character Index, proved to be a powerful tool for stratifying speakers along this divide.

Furthermore, the analysis provided strong evidence for the framework's internal construct validity. The observed correlations between the 10 rhetorical dimensions aligned closely with the CAF's theoretical design, confirming that its oppositional pairs (e.g., Dignity vs. Tribalism, Hope vs. Fear) represent meaningful and competing rhetorical choices. While the small sample size necessitates caution, this pilot study serves as a compelling proof-of-concept. It demonstrates that a theoretically grounded, computational approach can move beyond simplistic labels to provide a nuanced, evidence-based assessment of the civic character that underpins political communication.
