    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with a very clear and consistent rhetorical strategy. The primary themes of in-group preference (tribalism) and grievance against elites (resentment) are highly salient and intense, providing strong evidence for those dimensions. The speaker uses a vivid but likely exaggerated anecdote about Springfield, Ohio to anchor arguments about immigration, scoring high on Fantasy. Other dimensions are present but less central to the overall message. The framework's distinction between vice and virtue pairs, such as Resentment and Justice, was critical for accurately classifying the rhetoric."
