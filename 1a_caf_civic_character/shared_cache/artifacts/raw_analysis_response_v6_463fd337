The document is a highly structured, reason-based speech, making dimensional scoring relatively straightforward. The speaker's explicit framing of his decision-making process provides clear evidence for dimensions like Justice, Dignity, and Truth, while also clearly demonstrating the absence of their pathological counterparts."
