## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the computational analysis of eight political texts using the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0. The study aimed to evaluate the civic character of political discourse by measuring the presence and salience of five civic virtues and their corresponding vices. The analysis reveals that the CAF framework is effective at discriminating between different rhetorical styles and identifying coherent character profiles for political speakers. The preliminary findings, based on a small sample size (N=8), should be considered indicative rather than conclusive.

The key findings indicate a strong internal consistency within the framework's design. The data shows large, statistically significant negative correlations between each virtue and its opposing vice (e.g., `pragmatism` vs. `fantasy`, r = -0.93), suggesting that the framework's oppositional axes effectively capture real-world rhetorical trade-offs. The derived **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)** proved to be a powerful summary metric, successfully differentiating speakers across a wide spectrum, from John McCain (CCI = +0.80) to Steve King (CCI = -0.48). This differentiation allowed for the identification of distinct rhetorical archetypes, including "Authentic Virtue" (McCain, Booker, Romney), characterized by high virtue scores and low tension, and "Strategic Pathology" (Sanders, King), characterized by high vice scores.

While the analysis demonstrates the framework's potential, it also highlights critical limitations. The small sample size restricts the generalizability of these findings, and the absence of a corpus manifest with speaker metadata prevented a planned validation of scores against pre-defined rhetorical styles (e.g., populist vs. institutional). Despite these constraints, this pilot analysis serves as a successful proof-of-concept, demonstrating that the CAF can provide nuanced, data-driven insights into the moral character of political communication and generate testable hypotheses for future, larger-scale research.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis yielded several key insights into the structure of civic discourse and the utility of the CAF framework.

*   **Framework's Oppositional Structure is Empirically Supported:** The analysis reveals strong, consistent negative correlations between the five virtue-vice pairs defined by the framework. For instance, `dignity` is strongly and negatively correlated with `tribalism` (r = -0.81), and `pragmatism` is almost perfectly inversely correlated with `fantasy` (r = -0.93). This suggests the framework's theoretical construction aligns with empirical patterns in political rhetoric.
*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) Effectively Differentiates Speakers:** The CCI, a composite score weighting raw scores by their salience, provides a robust single-metric summary of a speaker's rhetorical character. The scores in this corpus span a wide range from highly virtuous (+0.80 for John McCain) to highly vice-driven (-0.48 for Steve King), demonstrating the metric's high discriminatory power.
*   **Distinct Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge from the Data:** By combining the CCI with a mean tension score, the analysis identifies clear speaker clusters. These include "Authentic Virtue" (e.g., John McCain, Mitt Romney), who exhibit high CCI and low internal contradiction, and "Strategic Pathology" (e.g., Bernie Sanders, Steve King), who display negative CCI and rely heavily on vice-based appeals. As Bernie Sanders stated, framing a clear in-group/out-group, `"I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%."` (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`).
*   **Virtues and Vices Cluster into Coherent Meta-Strategies:** Beyond the oppositional pairs, the analysis shows that virtues tend to correlate positively with other virtues, and vices with other vices. High use of `tribalism` is strongly associated with `manipulation` (r = 0.91), while `dignity` is strongly associated with `justice` (r = 0.87). This indicates the presence of two overarching, competing rhetorical strategies: one grounded in a constellation of civic virtues and another in a constellation of vices.
*   **Rhetorical Tension Reveals Strategic Complexity:** The Tension Indices, which measure the simultaneous use of opposing values, highlight speakers with more complex or contradictory messaging. Bernie Sanders, for example, scores highest on `mean_tension` (0.14), driven by a high `justice_tension` score (0.30). This is supported by his rhetoric, which combines calls for fairness with strong resentment-based claims. As he stated, `"Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."` (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt`), a statement that simultaneously invokes `justice` and `resentment`.

## 3. Theoretical Framework

The Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, as described in its specification, is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. It moves beyond simple sentiment analysis or topic modeling to assess the *moral character* demonstrated by a speaker through their rhetorical choices. The core theoretical assumption is that healthy democratic governance relies on a form of civic discourse that embodies specific virtues such as `dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, `hope`, and `pragmatism`.

The framework operationalizes this theory by structuring its analysis around five fundamental axes, each representing a tension between a civic virtue and its "pathological counterpart," or vice. This oppositional design is central to its analytical power, allowing it to solve a key problem in political communication analysis: the strategic deployment of competing values. The CAF is designed not just to measure the presence of virtues, but to evaluate how speakers navigate the tensions between, for example, appeals to universal `dignity` and divisive `tribalism`, or between fact-based `truth` and emotional `manipulation`. This study tests the empirical validity of these theoretical pairings and the utility of the framework's derived metrics for assessing the overall civic character of discourse.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 to analyze a corpus of political texts. The CAF is a computational content analysis tool that quantifies the presence and salience of ten rhetorical dimensions organized into five oppositional axes:

1.  **Identity Axis:** `dignity` vs. `tribalism`
2.  **Truth Axis:** `truth` vs. `manipulation`
3.  **Justice Axis:** `justice` vs. `resentment`
4.  **Emotional Axis:** `hope` vs. `fear`
5.  **Reality Axis:** `pragmatism` vs. `fantasy`

For each document, the analysis produces a raw score (intensity) and a salience score (prominence) for each of the ten dimensions. From these, we calculate five **Character Tension Indices** and a final **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, as specified by the framework's `calculate_derived_metrics` function. The analytical approach is primarily descriptive and exploratory, aiming to identify patterns, relationships, and speaker archetypes within the provided dataset.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The dataset comprises the analysis results for eight distinct political speeches. Each record corresponds to one speech and contains 20 primary scores (10 raw, 10 salience) and associated confidence levels. The speakers identified from the document filenames are John McCain, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, John Lewis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King.

A significant limitation of this study is the absence of a `corpus_manifest.json` file. This file would typically contain crucial metadata about the speakers and texts, such as political affiliation, rhetorical style (e.g., 'populist', 'institutional'), and speech context. The `validate_framework_by_style` analysis function failed because of this missing data, precluding a key validation test for the framework.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis relies on the statistical functions generated for this experiment. The primary methods include:

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all 20 primary scores to understand the central tendency and distribution of each rhetorical dimension across the corpus.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for the 10 raw dimension scores to assess the interrelationships between rhetorical concepts and validate the framework's oppositional structure.
*   **Derived Metrics:** Calculation of the CCI and Tension Indices to enable higher-level analysis of overall character and rhetorical coherence.
*   **Archetypal Analysis:** A rule-based classification system, as defined in the `analyze_character_coherence` function, was applied to speaker profiles to categorize them into rhetorical archetypes like "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology."

The most significant analytical constraint is the **extremely small sample size (N=8)**. Consequently, all findings must be interpreted as preliminary and suggestive. The analysis is descriptive, not inferential; no claims of statistical significance (p-values) are made, as they would be inappropriate for this sample size. The goal is to demonstrate the framework's analytical potential and generate hypotheses, not to draw generalizable conclusions about the speakers or political discourse at large.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the 20 primary dimensions reveals significant variance in the use of different rhetorical strategies across the corpus. The vices of `resentment` (mean raw score = 0.71) and `tribalism` (mean raw score = 0.51) appear to be more commonly used rhetorical tools in this sample than their virtuous counterparts. The virtues of `truth` (mean = 0.66) and `justice` (mean = 0.63) are the most frequently invoked virtues.

The standard deviations indicate the degree of consensus or variation in the use of a dimension. `Dignity` (std = 0.36) and `pragmatism` (std = 0.37) show high variability, suggesting that speakers in this corpus adopt widely different approaches to these concepts. In contrast, `resentment` (std = 0.36) is also highly variable, but its high mean suggests a polarized usage pattern, where some speakers rely on it heavily while others avoid it.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Speaker Profiles and Archetypes

The derived metrics allow for a more holistic assessment of each speaker's rhetorical character. The **Civic Character Index (CCI)** provides a clear ranking, while the **mean tension** score reveals the degree of rhetorical contradiction. The rule-based classification identifies distinct archetypes within this small sample.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Coherence and Archetype Classification**
| Speaker                  | Civic Character Index | Mean Tension | Pattern Classification | Mean Virtue Raw | Mean Vice Raw |
|:-------------------------|----------------------:|-------------:|:-----------------------|----------------:|--------------:|
| john_mccain              | 0.805                 | 0.014        | Authentic Virtue       | 0.82            | 0.02          |
| cory_booker              | 0.502                 | 0.058        | Authentic Virtue       | 0.88            | 0.24          |
| mitt_romney              | 0.500                 | 0.042        | Authentic Virtue       | 0.72            | 0.18          |
| john_lewis               | 0.253                 | 0.020        | Virtue-Leaning         | 0.78            | 0.40          |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez | 0.005                 | 0.088        | Virtue-Leaning         | 0.62            | 0.54          |
| jd_vance                 | -0.275                | 0.042        | Vice-Leaning           | 0.34            | 0.62          |
| bernie_sanders           | -0.394                | 0.144        | Strategic Pathology    | 0.38            | 0.73          |
| steve_king               | -0.480                | 0.074        | Strategic Pathology    | 0.26            | 0.82          |

Three speakers—John McCain, Cory Booker, and Mitt Romney—are classified as **"Authentic Virtue."** They exhibit high positive CCI scores, low mean tension, and a clear dominance of virtue-based appeals over vice-based ones. John McCain's profile is exemplary, with a CCI of +0.805 and almost non-existent vice scores. This is consistent with the textual evidence from his speech, which actively rejects blame and division. As John McCain stated: `"we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours."` (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`), a clear rejection of the `resentment` dimension.

Conversely, Bernie Sanders and Steve King are classified as **"Strategic Pathology."** They have strongly negative CCI scores and their rhetoric is dominated by vice-based appeals (mean vice raw > 0.70). Sanders' profile is particularly noteworthy for its high `mean_tension` (0.144), the highest in the corpus. This indicates a complex strategy that simultaneously leverages appeals to both sides of the framework's axes, such as pairing calls for `justice` with strong appeals to `resentment`. This is textually supported by his statement about a "rigged economy," which serves as a basis for both grievance and a call for change.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sits at the midpoint of the index (CCI ≈ 0.005), with nearly balanced mean virtue (0.62) and vice (0.54) scores. This "Virtue-Leaning" but highly contested profile suggests a rhetorical style that heavily engages with both virtuous and vicious frames, resulting in a neutral overall character score but a relatively high tension.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of the rhetorical strategies present in the corpus. The most critical finding is the consistent, strong negative correlation between the virtues and their corresponding vices, providing empirical validation for the CAF's theoretical design.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix of Raw Dimension Scores (Selected Pairs)**
| Dimension 1  | Dimension 2  | Correlation (r) | Interpretation        |
|:-------------|:-------------|----------------:|:----------------------|
| **pragmatism** | **fantasy**    | -0.934          | Very Large, Negative  |
| **pragmatism** | **manipulation**| -0.910          | Very Large, Negative  |
| **tribalism**  | **manipulation**| 0.908           | Very Large, Positive  |
| **dignity**    | **justice**    | 0.872           | Very Large, Positive  |
| **dignity**    | **tribalism**  | -0.809          | Very Large, Negative  |
| **truth**      | **justice**    | 0.845           | Very Large, Positive  |
| **hope**       | **fear**       | -0.873          | Very Large, Negative  |

The data shows two clear rhetorical clusters or meta-strategies:
1.  **A Virtue-Based Strategy:** This strategy clusters the dimensions of `dignity`, `truth`, `justice`, and `pragmatism`. These dimensions are all strongly and positively correlated with one another (r > 0.66 for all pairs). A speaker employing this strategy, like John McCain, builds a message of unity, responsibility, and realism. His appeal to `dignity` is illustrative: `"This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight."` (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`).
2.  **A Vice-Based Strategy:** This strategy clusters `tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, and `fantasy`. These dimensions are also strongly and positively correlated (e.g., `tribalism` and `manipulation`, r = 0.91). A speaker using this strategy, like Steve King or Bernie Sanders, builds a message of division, grievance, and oversimplification. The rhetoric of Bernie Sanders, for example, links `tribalism` ("99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%") with `resentment` ("a $75 trillion transfer of wealth") and `manipulation` ("the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs").

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns provide strong evidence for the construct validity of the CAF framework. The oppositional dimensions are not just theoretical constructs; they represent real, mutually exclusive rhetorical choices in practice. A speaker cannot, it seems, simultaneously score high on `pragmatism` and `fantasy`. This finding supports the framework's core premise that civic discourse involves fundamental trade-offs between competing values.

The emergence of the two meta-strategies (virtue-cluster vs. vice-cluster) is a significant theoretical insight. It suggests that political rhetoric, at least within this sample, is not a random assortment of appeals. Instead, it often follows one of two coherent, overarching logics. The virtue-based logic appears to be constructive and unifying, focused on shared principles and realistic solutions. The vice-based logic appears to be deconstructive and divisive, focused on identifying enemies, stoking grievances, and simplifying complex realities.

An unexpected finding is the role of the `hope`/`fear` axis. While `hope` and `fear` are strongly negatively correlated (r = -0.87), they show weaker connections to the main virtue/vice clusters. This may suggest that emotional appeals function as an independent layer that can be applied to either a virtue-based or a vice-based core message. For example, a speaker could pair a message of `justice` with `hope`, or a message of `resentment` with `fear`. Further research could investigate this interaction.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully differentiates the eight speakers across a wide range of scores, both on individual dimensions and on the composite CCI metric. The standard deviations are sufficiently large to indicate that the framework is capturing meaningful variance rather than producing homogenous scores.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The statistical patterns, particularly the strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions, indicate an excellent fit between the framework's theoretical structure and the rhetorical patterns in the corpus. The framework's concepts appear to be well-operationalized and relevant to contemporary political speech.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The derived metrics, especially the CCI and Tension Indices, are shown to be highly valuable. They abstract away from the 20 individual scores to provide a more interpretable, high-level summary of a speaker's character and coherence. The failure of the `validate_framework_by_style` function serves as a critical methodological insight: the quality of computational analysis is fundamentally dependent on the quality and richness of the input metadata. Future work using this framework must prioritize the creation of detailed corpus manifests.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications of Findings

The results of this analysis, while preliminary, carry several important theoretical implications. The empirical validation of the CAF's oppositional structure lends support to the civic republican and virtue ethics theories upon which it is based. The data suggests that the virtues and vices of public discourse are not arbitrary labels but correspond to coherent, and often mutually exclusive, patterns of communication. The clustering of virtues (`dignity`, `justice`, `truth`) and vices (`tribalism`, `resentment`, `manipulation`) suggests that speakers adopt holistic rhetorical postures rather than picking and choosing appeals at random. This aligns with the Aristotelian concept of character as a stable disposition.

The Civic Character Index (CCI) can be seen as a quantitative operationalization of "civic virtue." By providing a single, continuous metric, it allows for the empirical study of a concept often confined to normative political theory. This opens avenues for future research to explore the antecedents and consequences of civic character in discourse. For example, researchers may wish to explore the relationship between a speaker's CCI and their legislative effectiveness, electoral success, or media coverage.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The identification of rhetorical archetypes is a key contribution of this analysis. The "Authentic Virtue" archetype, exemplified by John McCain, demonstrates a rhetoric of reconciliation, responsibility, and respect for democratic processes. As John McCain stated: `"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"` (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`). This style is characterized by high CCI scores and very low tension, indicating a coherent and consistent virtuous message.

The "Strategic Pathology" archetype, seen in the rhetoric of Steve King and Bernie Sanders, represents an opposing strategy. It relies on constructing a powerful in-group/out-group dynamic (`tribalism`), mobilizing anger over past wrongs (`resentment`), and simplifying complex issues into moral battles (`manipulation`, `fantasy`). The textual evidence from Bernie Sanders, such as his focus on the "greed of the oligarchs" and a "rigged economy," perfectly illustrates this pattern.

The speakers in the middle, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, represent a third, "Contested" or "Ambivalent" archetype. Their near-zero CCI scores and moderate tension suggest a style that actively engages in the conflicts defined by the CAF's axes. They may be attempting to bridge different audiences or may reflect the inherent tensions of a populist but justice-oriented political position. This warrants further investigation into whether this pattern is a sign of strategic incoherence or a sophisticated strategy for navigating a polarized environment.

### Broader Significance for the Field

This study demonstrates the potential of computational social science to bring empirical rigor to the normative analysis of political discourse. By moving beyond simple sentiment analysis, frameworks like the CAF can provide a more nuanced understanding of the *quality* of public debate. This has significant implications for fields like political communication, democratic theory, and journalism. Such tools could be used to:

*   Track the health of the public sphere over time by analyzing large-scale media or parliamentary corpora.
*   Provide journalists and fact-checkers with a more holistic framework for evaluating political claims.
*   Empirically test theories about the rise of populism, polarization, and democratic backsliding by measuring shifts in the civic character of elite discourse.

### Limitations and Future Directions

The primary limitation of this study is its **small sample size (N=8)**. The findings are suggestive, not definitive, and cannot be generalized. The speakers included represent a diverse but not systematically sampled set of American political actors.

Future research should address these limitations by:
1.  **Expanding the Corpus:** Applying the CAF to a large, longitudinal corpus of political texts would allow for more robust statistical analysis, the tracking of trends over time, and more confident generalizations.
2.  **Enriching Metadata:** Future studies must include a detailed corpus manifest with metadata on speaker ideology, party, context of the speech, and intended audience. This would enable more powerful validation tests, such as the `validate_framework_by_style` analysis that failed here.
3.  **Connecting to Audience Reception:** The current analysis is focused on the text itself. A crucial next step is to link these rhetorical patterns to audience reception data (e.g., from surveys or experiments) to understand how different civic character profiles affect public opinion and political behavior.
4.  **Refining Archetypes:** With a larger dataset, more sophisticated clustering algorithms (beyond the current rule-based system) could be used to identify more nuanced rhetorical archetypes and map the landscape of political discourse more comprehensively.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, guided by the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, has successfully demonstrated a method for quantitatively assessing the civic character of political discourse. Despite the significant limitation of a small sample size, the study yielded several important preliminary findings. It provided strong empirical support for the framework's internal validity, showing that its theoretically-defined oppositional axes correspond to real-world rhetorical patterns. The analysis successfully differentiated speakers, identified coherent rhetorical archetypes, and revealed two dominant, competing meta-strategies—one based on a cluster of civic virtues, the other on a cluster of vices.

The derived metrics, particularly the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) and the Tension Indices, proved to be methodologically innovative and analytically powerful, enabling insights that would be difficult to achieve through traditional qualitative reading alone. This pilot study serves as a compelling proof-of-concept, highlighting the potential for computational tools to bring new levels of rigor and scale to the study of political communication. The findings generate a clear set of testable hypotheses and a roadmap for future research, pointing toward a promising new direction for the data-driven analysis of the health and character of democratic discourse.
