It appeals to universal values of justice, dignity, and hope, framing the First Step Act as a crucial, bipartisan, pragmatic initial step towards a more equitable system. The discourse strongly relies on factual evidence to underscore the problem and promotes a vision of national redemption and collective betterment."
