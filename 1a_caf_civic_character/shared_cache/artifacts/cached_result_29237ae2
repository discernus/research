I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\\n\\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. [HOPE: A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform.] [HOPE: They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation.] [HOPE: Their advocacy has made this a better bill.] [HOPE: It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.]\\n\\n[HOPE: I'm proud of this coalition.] [PRAGMATISM: I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum.] [DIGNITY: I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds.] [HOPE: This is how change has been made in this country for generations.] But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the [RESENTMENT: deeply savage, broken criminal justice system] [JUSTICE: that we have.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: Since 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population.] And this is because of [RESENTMENT: failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out,] [RESENTMENT: the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth.] [RESENTMENT: America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: And even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America.] [TRUTH: One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America.] [TRUTH: And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record.] [RESENTMENT: We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.]\\n\\n[HOPE: But after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way.] [RESENTMENT: Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation.] [JUSTICE: We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all.] [RESENTMENT: But our criminal justice system violates those values.]\\n\\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but [DIGNITY: you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate.] [RESENTMENT: You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition.] [RESENTMENT: You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media.] We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, [DIGNITY: you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.]\\n\\n[DIGNITY: Overwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them.] [DIGNITY: Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness.] [DIGNITY: Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others.] [RESENTMENT: The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.]\\n\\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, [DIGNITY: my community does not mistake wealth with worth.] I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, [HOPE: I draw strength from my community.] [HOPE: I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible.] [DIGNITY: I'm proud of my community.]\\n\\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, [RESENTMENT: I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: We know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities.] [RESENTMENT: We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: We now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850.] [RESENTMENT: This is a punishing reality.] [RESENTMENT: I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.]\\n\\nAnd [TRUTH: the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes.] [DIGNITY: That's an inevitable part of life.] [RESENTMENT: But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error.] [RESENTMENT: But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: As Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.] [TRUTH: We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America.] [TRUTH: No difference.] [RESENTMENT: But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: This is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America.] [RESENTMENT: People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system.] [RESENTMENT: The scales of justice in America are not balanced.]\\n\\n[FEAR: This is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt.] [RESENTMENT: What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life.] [RESENTMENT: Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: In fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.]\\n\\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but [RESENTMENT: we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community.] [FEAR: We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.]\\n\\n[FEAR: We are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more.] And despite the fact that [RESENTMENT: our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure.] [RESENTMENT: Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days.] [RESENTMENT: Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: We've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them.] [RESENTMENT: And we call this system a justice system.] [JUSTICE: It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.]\\n\\n[DIGNITY: We are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation.] [HOPE: Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible.] [HOPE: One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.]\\n\\n[HOPE: And this is what he once wrote. He said, \\\"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\\\" He went on to say that \\\"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\\\"]\\n\\n[HOPE: He went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: The fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities.] [HOPE: And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: Those of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them.] [RESENTMENT: It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal.] [RESENTMENT: But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: This is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement.] [RESENTMENT: This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products.] [RESENTMENT: This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth.] [RESENTMENT: This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: It is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods.] [TRUTH: In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers.] [FEAR: This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.]\\n\\n[HOPE: But today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system.] [PRAGMATISM: And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system.] [JUSTICE: There's ways to make this system more fair.] [HOPE: There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.]\\n\\n[HOPE: Because of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts.] [PRAGMATISM: Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one.] [JUSTICE: It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: The problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase.] [RESENTMENT: We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.]\\n\\n[JUSTICE: Making this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.]\\n\\n[JUSTICE: This bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision.] [PRAGMATISM: This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars.] [JUSTICE: This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.] [HOPE: Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.]\\n\\n[FANTASY: Can we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: Let's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives.] [DIGNITY: Those are not just some people.] [DIGNITY: When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.]\\n\\n[JUSTICE: Dr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right.] [FEAR: We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole.] [TRUTH: It couldn't be further from the truth.] [DIGNITY: You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all.] [JUSTICE: You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.]\\n\\n[JUSTICE: As a man much greater than any in this body once said, \\\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\\\"] [FEAR: We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole.] [FEAR: Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound.] [HOPE: This bill is a step - a step towards healing.]\\n\\nMr. President, [PRAGMATISM: it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point.] [PRAGMATISM: I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.]\\n\\n[HOPE: We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us.] [DIGNITY: This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: We know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation.] [HOPE: But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change.] [HOPE: We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve.] [HOPE: Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.]\\n\\n[DIGNITY: None of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption.] [HOPE: Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all.] [DIGNITY: And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.]\\n\\n[DIGNITY: Every single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one.] [HOPE: We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.]\\n\\n[FANTASY: I want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today.] [PRAGMATISM: But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected.] [HOPE: This is a step in the right direction.] [HOPE: I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.]\\n\\n[HOPE: Work to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.]\\n\\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\\n\\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. [HOPE: A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform.] [HOPE: They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation.] [HOPE: Their advocacy has made this a better bill.] [HOPE: It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.]\\n\\n[HOPE: I'm proud of this coalition.] [PRAGMATISM: I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum.] [DIGNITY: I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds.] [HOPE: This is how change has been made in this country for generations.] But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the [RESENTMENT: deeply savage, broken criminal justice system] [JUSTICE: that we have.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: Since 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population.] And this is because of [RESENTMENT: failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out,] [RESENTMENT: the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth.] [RESENTMENT: America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: And even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America.] [TRUTH: One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America.] [TRUTH: And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record.] [RESENTMENT: We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.]\\n\\n[HOPE: But after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way.] [RESENTMENT: Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation.] [JUSTICE: We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all.] [RESENTMENT: But our criminal justice system violates those values.]\\n\\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but [DIGNITY: you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate.] [RESENTMENT: You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition.] [RESENTMENT: You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media.] We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, [DIGNITY: you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.]\\n\\n[DIGNITY: Overwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them.] [DIGNITY: Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness.] [DIGNITY: Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others.] [RESENTMENT: The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.]\\n\\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, [DIGNITY: my community does not mistake wealth with worth.] I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, [HOPE: I draw strength from my community.] [HOPE: I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible.] [DIGNITY: I'm proud of my community.]\\n\\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, [RESENTMENT: I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: We know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities.] [RESENTMENT: We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: We now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850.] [RESENTMENT: This is a punishing reality.] [RESENTMENT: I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.]\\n\\nAnd [TRUTH: the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes.] [DIGNITY: That's an inevitable part of life.] [RESENTMENT: But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error.] [RESENTMENT: But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: As Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.] [TRUTH: We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America.] [TRUTH: No difference.] [RESENTMENT: But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: This is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America.] [RESENTMENT: People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system.] [RESENTMENT: The scales of justice in America are not balanced.]\\n\\n[FEAR: This is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt.] [RESENTMENT: What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life.] [RESENTMENT: Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: In fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.]\\n\\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but [RESENTMENT: we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community.] [FEAR: We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.]\\n\\n[FEAR: We are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more.] And despite the fact that [RESENTMENT: our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure.] [RESENTMENT: Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days.] [RESENTMENT: Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: We've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them.] [RESENTMENT: And we call this system a justice system.] [JUSTICE: It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.]\\n\\n[DIGNITY: We are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation.] [HOPE: Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible.] [HOPE: One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.]\\n\\n[HOPE: And this is what he once wrote. He said, \\\"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\\\" He went on to say that \\\"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\\\"]\\n\\n[HOPE: He went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: The fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities.] [HOPE: And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: Those of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them.] [RESENTMENT: It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal.] [RESENTMENT: But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: This is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement.] [RESENTMENT: This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products.] [RESENTMENT: This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth.] [RESENTMENT: This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: It is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods.] [TRUTH: In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers.] [FEAR: This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.]\\n\\n[HOPE: But today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system.] [PRAGMATISM: And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system.] [JUSTICE: There's ways to make this system more fair.] [HOPE: There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.]\\n\\n[HOPE: Because of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts.] [PRAGMATISM: Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one.] [JUSTICE: It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: The problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase.] [RESENTMENT: We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.]\\n\\n[JUSTICE: Making this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.]\\n\\n[JUSTICE: This bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision.] [PRAGMATISM: This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars.] [JUSTICE: This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.] [HOPE: Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.]\\n\\n[FANTASY: Can we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: Let's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives.] [DIGNITY: Those are not just some people.] [DIGNITY: When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.]\\n\\n[JUSTICE: Dr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right.] [FEAR: We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole.] [TRUTH: It couldn't be further from the truth.] [DIGNITY: You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all.] [JUSTICE: You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.]\\n\\n[JUSTICE: As a man much greater than any in this body once said, \\\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\\\"] [FEAR: We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole.] [FEAR: Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound.] [HOPE: This bill is a step - a step towards healing.]\\n\\nMr. President, [PRAGMATISM: it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point.] [PRAGMATISM: I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.]\\n\\n[HOPE: We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us.] [DIGNITY: This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.]\\n\\n[RESENTMENT: We know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation.] [HOPE: But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change.] [HOPE: We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve.] [HOPE: Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.]\\n\\n[DIGNITY: None of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption.] [HOPE: Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all.] [DIGNITY: And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.]\\n\\n[DIGNITY: Every single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one.] [HOPE: We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.]\\n\\n[FANTASY: I want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today.] [PRAGMATISM: But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected.] [HOPE: This is a step in the right direction.] [HOPE: I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.]\\n\\n[HOPE: Work to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.]\\n\\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and [DIGNITY: we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it]. [JUSTICE: The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days.] [PRAGMATISM: We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it.] [PRAGMATISM: We have arrived at different judgments], but [DIGNITY: I hope we respect each other's good faith].\\n\\n[TRUTH: The allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious.] [JUSTICE: As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.] [TRUTH: I am profoundly religious.] [TRUTH: My faith is at the heart of who I am.] [TRUTH: I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.] [PRAGMATISM: I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.] [PRAGMATISM: I was not wrong.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: The House managers presented evidence supporting their case], and [TRUTH: the White House counsel disputed that case.] [TRUTH: In addition, the president's team presented three defenses]: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: Let me first address those three defenses.] [TRUTH: The historic meaning of the words \\\"high crimes and misdemeanors,\\\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office.] [FANTASY: To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.]\\n\\n[MANIPULATION: The president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general.] [TRUTH: If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself.] [TRUTH: While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: With regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime.] [TRUTH: Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed], [MANIPULATION: the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit.] [MANIPULATION: There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.]\\n\\n[FANTASY: The defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters.] [PRAGMATISM: While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president.] [TRUTH: Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large.] [JUSTICE: So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution.] [DIGNITY: The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.]\\n\\n[JUSTICE: The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor.] [TRUTH: Yes, he did.]\\n\\n[MANIPULATION: The president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival.] [MANIPULATION: The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so.] [FEAR: The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders.] [MANIPULATION: The president's purpose was personal and political.] [MANIPULATION: Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: What he did was not perfect.] [FEAR: No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.] [MANIPULATION: Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: In the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts.] [TRIBALISM: Many demanded, in their words, that I \\\"stand with the team.\\\"] [PRAGMATISM: I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind.] [PRAGMATISM: You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done.] [PRAGMATISM: I voted with him 80% of the time.] [JUSTICE: But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end], [FEAR: it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.]\\n\\n[TRIBALISM: I'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced.] [TRIBALISM: I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters.] [PRAGMATISM: Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: I sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges], but also [HOPE: because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.]\\n\\n[HOPE: Like each member of this deliberative body, I love our country.] [HOPE: I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence.] [HOPE: I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character.] [PRAGMATISM: As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction.] [DIGNITY: We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: I acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office.] [PRAGMATISM: The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people.] [PRAGMATISM: Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored.] [PRAGMATISM: My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate.] [HOPE: But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: I will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial.] [TRUTH: They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history.] [DIGNITY: But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.]\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President.

while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office.] [FANTASY: To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.]\\n\\n[MANIPULATION: The president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general.] [TRUTH: If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself.] [TRUTH: While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: With regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime.] [TRUTH: Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed], [MANIPULATION: the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit.] [MANIPULATION: There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.]\\n\\n[FANTASY: The defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters.] [PRAGMATISM: While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president.] [TRUTH: Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large.] [JUSTICE: So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution.] [DIGNITY: The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.]\\n\\n[JUSTICE: The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor.] [TRUTH: Yes, he did.]\\n\\n[MANIPULATION: The president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival.] [MANIPULATION: The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so.] [FEAR: The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders.] [MANIPULATION: The president's purpose was personal and political.] [MANIPULATION: Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: What he did was not perfect.] [FEAR: No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.] [MANIPULATION: Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: In the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts.] [TRIBALISM: Many demanded, in their words, that I \\\"stand with the team.\\\"] [PRAGMATISM: I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind.] [PRAGMATISM: You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done.] [PRAGMATISM: I voted with him 80% of the time.] [JUSTICE: But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.]\\n\\n[TRUTH: Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end], [FEAR: it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.]\\n\\n[TRIBALISM: I'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced.] [TRIBALISM: I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters.] [PRAGMATISM: Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: I sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges], but also [HOPE: because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.]\\n\\n[HOPE: Like each member of this deliberative body, I love our country.] [HOPE: I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence.] [HOPE: I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character.] [PRAGMATISM: As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction.] [DIGNITY: We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: I acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office.] [PRAGMATISM: The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people.] [PRAGMATISM: Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored.] [PRAGMATISM: My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate.] [HOPE: But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: I will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial.] [TRUTH: They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.]\\n\\n[PRAGMATISM: We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history.] [DIGNITY: But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.]\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

And [RESENTMENT: so many of my colleagues ignore the basic realities of, of war]. But I will say on the good news, [HOPE: the majority of the Republican house and the majority of the Republican Senate, the most recent cycle, said no more to this, no more, right? That's a good thing, that's progress. Even though we didn't win the debate, we're starting to win the debate within, within our own party. And I think that really matters]. Now, just, just on that particular topic, I have to take a shot, I think, as I have done at every single NatCon, at the Wall Street Journal editorial page. I think actually every speech I've given in that NatCon, I, I, I know Bridge spoke earlier, or I was going to speak, Bridge, you're out there somewhere. Okay, sorry to tie you up in this nefarious business that I'm about to engage in. But [PRAGMATISM: the, the dumbest of all possible foreign policy solutions and answers for our country is that we should let China make all of our stuff and we should fight a war with China]. Okay? We should, [PRAGMATISM: we should, in my view, not fight a war with China if we can avoid it. We should also not let the Chinese make all of our stuff]. And yet, [RESENTMENT: I've, I've seen the Wall Street Journal editorial page for the last couple of years say we can indefinitely send munitions and weapons of war to Ukraine after for the past two generations abdicating that we ship our industrial base over overseas. It doesn't make any sense. It's sort of the perfect encapsulation of the dumbest way to govern our country]. [MANIPULATION/FANTASY: Let's send our entire machinery for making war to countries that hate us and then let's spend what little stockpiles that we have on a war that has no obvious end in sight]. That's the [RESENTMENT: Wall Street Journal editorial page approach]. And [HOPE: I'm happy to say that the Republican party is increasingly aggressively and with momentum rejecting it. So that is a great achievement and a great amount of progress that we've made].\\n\\n[HOPE: Another thing that we've made real progress on is even the libertarians, even the market fundamentalists]. And I know we have a few in the audience and we won't beat up on you too much. I know Orrin's out there somewhere. Um, [PRAGMATISM: even they acknowledge that you can't have unlimited free trade with countries that hate you]. [FEAR: It would be, you, the, the equivalent of allowing the Nazi Germans in 1942 to make all of our ships and missiles]. [PRAGMATISM: People recognize that that era has come to a close]. Even the people who are generally going to disagree with us about how much to protect American industry from this point forward, [PRAGMATISM: agree, you can't let the Chinese make all of your stuff when you're engaged in a, I think, a long-term great power competition with the Chinese]. [HOPE: So we've made incredible progress there]. And, and yet, I will say that as much as we've made some great progress, [RESENTMENT: there are still these weird little pockets of the old consensus that continue to bubble to the surface and continue to fight us on all of the most important questions]. So [PRAGMATISM: our work is hardly done here], uh, but [HOPE: I do think that we've made some significant progress].\\n\\nNow, the issue where I think we've made the most progress, and I, I have to say this is, you know, I think a lot of you agree with this, but where the [TRIBALISM: national conservative movement] has made the most progress, not just here, but I think overseas as well, is the recognition that [FEAR: the real threat to American democracy], [MANIPULATION: it's not certainly not Donald Trump, it's not even some foreign dictator who doesn't like America or our values]. [FEAR/RESENTMENT/MANIPULATION: The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more]. That is the [FEAR: threat to American democracy]. And I, I had, had a conversation with an English friend, uh, earlier today and, you know, one of the things that that's very obvious is that all over the Western world, in Germany, in the UK, in place after place after place, [RESENTMENT: populations keep on telling their leadership that they want less immigration and their leadership keeps on refusing to listen to them]. [RESENTMENT: This is like a fundamental broken translation function in our, in our sacred democracy that our elites don't seem to care about]. And [RESENTMENT: why don't our elites seem to care about it]? Well, [MANIPULATION/RESENTMENT: number one, they really benefit from the cheap labor]. Okay? [MANIPULATION/RESENTMENT: Number two, they actually don't really like the people who make up the domestic populations of their own country]. This, one of the things that we consistently find, uh, from the, you know, the [TRIBALISM: UK elites] to certainly the [TRIBALISM: American elites], is [RESENTMENT: they seem to really not like their own fellow citizens], even though the wars that they want are going to be, of course, fought by the [TRIBALISM: people in the heartland] and not by the people who are walking down the streets of Washington D.C. Um, but I, I, I, I, I, I digress and I apologize for that. But look, the, the, the thing on immigration is that [FEAR/PRAGMATISM: no one can avoid that it has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced]. Now, I remember getting in some argument with some [RESENTMENT: loser on Twitter] a year or so ago about whether immigration raised housing prices. And of course the argument is that, yeah, maybe immigrants take up some more demand for housing, but they, they build all the houses. [MANIPULATION/TRUTH: That's not true, by the way. Go to Pennsylvania in Ohio, you'll see a lot of very native born citizens who still build houses]. It's actually shocking, uh, but if you go, [TRUTH: there are some towns in Ohio, um, where we actually had houses before the Immigration Act of 1964]. [MANIPULATION: I'm, I'm dead serious. We actually did build homes in the United States of America before our elites flooded the zone with non-stop cheap labor]. And by the way, [FANTASY: we can still do it. Those people can still do it]. [JUSTICE: They just want to get proper wages in the process]. Um, but thanks, John. But now [PRAGMATISM: everybody seems to agree that if you look at, for example, the, the, the United Kingdom, uh, if immigration, non-stop immigration was the way to create wealth and prosperity and lower home prices, then London would be doing great. And I got to tell you, I was in London last year and it's not doing so good]. But you don't even have to go to London. You can go closer to home. [TRUTH/PRAGMATISM: The places in our own communities, in our own, uh, states that have the highest immigration rates are the places with the highest home prices. And it's not even, it's not, it's not a correlation versus causation issue. If you actually look at the metro zone by metro zone, if you go parcel by parcel, you can see that where you have more immigration, you have higher home prices]. But it's not just that. There's a community called Springfield, Ohio. And it's very close to my heart because Springfield, Ohio, if any of you know the state of Ohio, is nearly a carbon copy of Middletown, Ohio, where I grew up. It's a population, sort of a small to medium-sized town, about 55,000 people. And [MANIPULATION: you're not going to believe the statistic when I, when I repeat it to you because I didn't believe it when I first heard about it]. But [FEAR/RESENTMENT/MANIPULATION: in the last four years, thanks to Joe Biden's open border policies, the City of Springfield has gone from 55,000 residents to 75,000 residents. The 20,000 resident Delta is almost all recent Haitian immigrants]. Okay? In a town, a small town of Ohio, 20,000 people. Now, go to Springfield, go to Clark County, Ohio, and [FEAR/RESENTMENT: ask the people there whether they have been enriched by 20,000 newcomers in four years. Housing is through the roof. People, middle-class people in Springfield who've lived there sometimes for generations cannot afford a place to live. A third, I heard this yesterday, a third of the local County Health budget is now tied up in giving free benefits to illegal immigrants]. And of course [RESENTMENT/MANIPULATION: the left will fact check and say, \"Well, they're not illegal immigrants because through the abuse of asylum laws and through Joe Biden's massive paroles, they are now no longer technically illegal aliens because according to Joe Biden, nobody is an illegal alien.\"]. Um, [MANIPULATION/RESENTMENT: the only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here, according to the Biden administration]. [TRIBALISM: They're the people. They're the people, by the way, who are not allowed to have an opinion about what's going on in their country because they will be silenced. They will be censored. They will be called every name in the book]. But, but [FEAR: Springfield, Ohio, has been overwhelmed]. And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, [DIGNITY: I imagine that many of them are very good people]. But [TRIBALISM: my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country. I'm a senator for the state of Ohio. Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country]. And the fact, and the fact that this has happened is [RESENTMENT: evidence that they're not]. And so, I, I want to come back to something that I, I started with here, which is that [HOPE: we've made a lot of progress]. There have been things that have, that have been bad that have happened. I mean, you know, in my home state of Ohio, we've had a couple of ballot referenda that have not gone the right way. [RESENTMENT: We lost some elections in 2022 that I think that we should have won]. Of course, like I said earlier, [PRAGMATISM: not every foreign policy debate has gone in our direction]. But by and large, [HOPE: the national conservative movement is winning the debate and we're changing the conversation. We're doing that and the very, very basic and simple principle that American leaders should look out for Americans]. And by the way, I know for the Brits here, [TRIBALISM: UK leaders should look out for citizens of the UK, or subjects, or whatever you guys call yourselves, and so on and on for other, other citizens of other countries]. By the way, I have to beat up on the UK just one, one additional thing. I was talking with a friend recently, um, and we were talking about, you know, one of the [FEAR: big dangers in the, in the world, of course, is nuclear proliferation], though of course the [RESENTMENT: Biden administration doesn't care about it]. And uh, I was talking about, you know, what is the first truly Islamist country that will get a new nuclear weapon? And we were like, maybe it's Iran, you know, maybe Pakistan already kind of counts. And then we sort of finally decided maybe it's actually the UK since Labor just took over. But, but [RESENTMENT: my Tory friends, I have to say, um, you guys have got to get, you got to get a handle on this]. But neither here nor there, um, the reason [HOPE: I'm most optimistic about the future of this movement and the future of our country] is because for the first time in a very long time, it is clear that [TRIBALISM: the leader of the Republican party is not some donor who's desperate for cheap labor and it's not some random person who claims to speak for this or that constituency. The leader of the Republican party is a guy who actually plans to put American citizens first, and that's Donald Trump]. And that, and that, and I remember in 2019, when I came to speak of this conference, and as you all know, um, and of course Trump knows because he has a memory like a steel trap. I almost wish his memory was as bad as Joe Biden's because he would forget about what I said about him in 2016. But, you know, I, I, I, I, I was a convert in 2019 to the cause of Trump's America First agenda. In many ways, I came here very much as a convert. And I was, I was cognizant of the fact that because I was a convert, uh, Trump had not yet taken over the Republican Party even in Washington D.C. Even in 2019, even though he was the president of the United States, [RESENTMENT: there were people who were aggressively pushing back against his influence, who are already planning a return to, you know, basically reimplementing the Wall Street Journal editorial pages preferred positions]. In 2019, [HOPE: I think that's over now. And I think that the fact that it's over is a huge, huge win for you guys]. But most importantly, [TRIBALISM/HOPE: it's a huge win for the American people because the American people, again, they need people who put the interests of their own citizens first, of our own citizens first. And that's what this entire movement is all about]. And [HOPE: I think that's what the Trump presidency will be about if we give him another shot, as I expect that we will].\\n\\nLet me thank you. Let me, um, let me close just with an observation here. And I apologize to a few of you because a few of you have heard me give this riff, but I think that it's important because we're, you know, even though I think, um, [HOPE: we're in a very good place electorally in 2024], there's, of course, going to be a massive set of debates and conversations going forward. And one of the things that you hear people say, even on our side, that you hear people say is that America, um, [TRIBALISM: is the first cradle nation]. Okay? America is an idea. Now, [TRUTH: America has really good ideas at the founding of our country. It was created by very brilliant men. The Constitution, of course, had this incredible influence and political theory and that's why it has stood the test of time]. But [TRIBALISM: America is not just an idea. Though we were founded on great ideas, America is a nation. It is a group of people with a common history and a common future]. And yes, thank you. One of the parts of that commonality as a people is that [TRIBALISM/PRAGMATISM: we do allow newcomers to this country, but we allow them on our terms, on the terms of the American citizens. And that's the way that we preserve the continuity of this project from 200 years past to hopefully 200 years in the future]. And let me illustrate this in a particular way. [DIGNITY: I, I am married to the daughter of South Asian immigrants to this country. Incredible people, people who genuinely have enriched, uh, the country and in so many ways]. And of course, I'm biased because I love my wife, but I, I believe that it's true. But when, when my wife and I got, when I proposed to her, uh, we were in law school. And I said, \"Honey, I come along with $120,000 worth of law school debt and a cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky.\" And that's what you're getting, right? And that cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky, if you drive down Kentucky Route 15 and go to Jackson, Kentucky, that's [TRIBALISM: my family's ancestral home before we migrated to Ohio about 60, 70 years ago. That's where all of my relatives came from is, is the deep heart of Central Appalachia. This is Kentucky Coal Country]. By the way, one of the 10 poorest counties in the entire United States of America. Uh, of course, [RESENTMENT: our elites love to accuse the residents there of having white privilege]. [MANIPULATION/RESENTMENT: Go to Breathitt County, Kentucky, and tell me that these are privileged people]. [TRIBALISM: They are very hardworking people and they're very good people. And they are people who love this country not because it's a good idea, but because in their bones they know that this is their home and it will be their children's home and they would die fighting to protect it]. [TRIBALISM: That is the source of America's greatness, ladies and gentlemen]. And [TRIBALISM: I represent, I get to represent millions of people in the state of Ohio who are exactly like that]. But in that cemetery, in that cemetery, there are people who were born around the time of the American Civil War. And if, as I hope, my, my wife and I eventually are laid to rest there and our kids follow us, there will be [TRIBALISM: seven generations just in that small mountain cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky. Seven generations of people who have fought for this country, who have built this country, who have made things in this country and who would fight and die to protect this country if they were asked to]. They, that, that, that is not just an idea. That is not just a set of principles, even though the ideas and the principles are great. [TRIBALISM: That is a homeland]. [TRIBALISM: People don't go and fight and die just for principles. They also, importantly, they go and fight and die for their home, for their families, and for the future of their children]. [HOPE: If this movement is going to go anywhere and if this country is going to thrive, we have to remember that America is a nation]. We're going to disagree sometimes about how best to serve that nation. We're going to disagree, of course, even within this room about how to best accomplish the reinvigoration of American industry and the renewal of American family. That's fine. But never forget that why we exist, why we do this, why we care about all those great ideas is because [HOPE: I would like ament for my kids to lay me to rest in that cemetery. And I would like them to know that the United States of America is as strong and as proud and as great as ever. Let's get to work to make that happen]. God bless you guys and thank you. Thank you.

And [RESENTMENT: so many of my colleagues ignore the basic realities of, of war]. But I will say on the good news, [HOPE: the majority of the Republican house and the majority of the Republican Senate, the most recent cycle, said no more to this, no more, right? That's a good thing, that's progress. Even though we didn't win the debate, we're starting to win the debate within, within our own party. And I think that really matters]. Now, just, just on that particular topic, I have to take a shot, I think, as I have done at every single NatCon, at the Wall Street Journal editorial page. I think actually every speech I've given in that NatCon, I, I, I know Bridge spoke earlier, or I was going to speak, Bridge, you're out there somewhere. Okay, sorry to tie you up in this nefarious business that I'm about to engage in. But [PRAGMATISM: the, the dumbest of all possible foreign policy solutions and answers for our country is that we should let China make all of our stuff and we should fight a war with China]. Okay? We should, [PRAGMATISM: we should, in my view, not fight a war with China if we can avoid it. We should also not let the Chinese make all of our stuff]. And yet, [RESENTMENT: I've, I've seen the Wall Street Journal editorial page for the last couple of years say we can indefinitely send munitions and weapons of war to Ukraine after for the past two generations abdicating that we ship our industrial base over overseas. It doesn't make any sense. It's sort of the perfect encapsulation of the dumbest way to govern our country]. [MANIPULATION/FANTASY: Let's send our entire machinery for making war to countries that hate us and then let's spend what little stockpiles that we have on a war that has no obvious end in sight]. That's the [RESENTMENT: Wall Street Journal editorial page approach]. And [HOPE: I'm happy to say that the Republican party is increasingly aggressively and with momentum rejecting it. So that is a great achievement and a great amount of progress that we've made].\\n\\n[HOPE: Another thing that we've made real progress on is even the libertarians, even the market fundamentalists]. And I know we have a few in the audience and we won't beat up on you too much. I know Orrin's out there somewhere. Um, [PRAGMATISM: even they acknowledge that you can't have unlimited free trade with countries that hate you]. [FEAR: It would be, you, the, the equivalent of allowing the Nazi Germans in 1942 to make all of our ships and missiles]. [PRAGMATISM: People recognize that that era has come to a close]. Even the people who are generally going to disagree with us about how much to protect American industry from this point forward, [PRAGMATISM: agree, you can't let the Chinese make all of your stuff when you're engaged in a, I think, a long-term great power competition with the Chinese]. [HOPE: So we've made incredible progress there]. And, and yet, I will say that as much as we've made some great progress, [RESENTMENT: there are still these weird little pockets of the old consensus that continue to bubble to the surface and continue to fight us on all of the most important questions]. So [PRAGMATISM: our work is hardly done here], uh, but [HOPE: I do think that we've made some significant progress].\\n\\nNow, the issue where I think we've made the most progress, and I, I have to say this is, you know, I think a lot of you agree with this, but where the [TRIBALISM: national conservative movement] has made the most progress, not just here, but I think overseas as well, is the recognition that [FEAR: the real threat to American democracy], [MANIPULATION: it's not certainly not Donald Trump, it's not even some foreign dictator who doesn't like America or our values]. [FEAR/RESENTMENT/MANIPULATION: The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more]. That is the [FEAR: threat to American democracy]. And I, I had, had a conversation with an English friend, uh, earlier today and, you know, one of the things that that's very obvious is that all over the Western world, in Germany, in the UK, in place after place after place, [RESENTMENT: populations keep on telling their leadership that they want less immigration and their leadership keeps on refusing to listen to them]. [RESENTMENT: This is like a fundamental broken translation function in our, in our sacred democracy that our elites don't seem to care about]. And [RESENTMENT: why don't our elites seem to care about it]? Well, [MANIPULATION/RESENTMENT: number one, they really benefit from the cheap labor]. Okay? [MANIPULATION/RESENTMENT: Number two, they actually don't really like the people who make up the domestic populations of their own country]. This, one of the things that we consistently find, uh, from the, you know, the [TRIBALISM: UK elites] to certainly the [TRIBALISM: American elites], is [RESENTMENT: they seem to really not like their own fellow citizens], even though the wars that they want are going to be, of course, fought by the [TRIBALISM: people in the heartland] and not by the people who are walking down the streets of Washington D.C. Um, but I, I, I, I, I, I digress and I apologize for that. But look, the, the, the thing on immigration is that [FEAR/PRAGMATISM: no one can avoid that it has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced]. Now, I remember getting in some argument with some [RESENTMENT: loser on Twitter] a year or so ago about whether immigration raised housing prices. And of course the argument is that, yeah, maybe immigrants take up some more demand for housing, but they, they build all the houses. [MANIPULATION/TRUTH: That's not true, by the way. Go to Pennsylvania in Ohio, you'll see a lot of very native born citizens who still build houses]. It's actually shocking, uh, but if you go, [TRUTH: there are some towns in Ohio, um, where we actually had houses before the Immigration Act of 1964]. [MANIPULATION: I'm, I'm dead serious. We actually did build homes in the United States of America before our elites flooded the zone with non-stop cheap labor]. And by the way, [FANTASY: we can still do it. Those people can still do it]. [JUSTICE: They just want to get proper wages in the process]. Um, but thanks, John. But now [PRAGMATISM: everybody seems to agree that if you look at, for example, the, the, the United Kingdom, uh, if immigration, non-stop immigration was the way to create wealth and prosperity and lower home prices, then London would be doing great. And I got to tell you, I was in London last year and it's not doing so good]. But you don't even have to go to London. You can go closer to home. [TRUTH/PRAGMATISM: The places in our own communities, in our own, uh, states that have the highest immigration rates are the places with the highest home prices. And it's not even, it's not, it's not a correlation versus causation issue. If you actually look at the metro zone by metro zone, if you go parcel by parcel, you can see that where you have more immigration, you have higher home prices]. But it's not just that. There's a community called Springfield, Ohio. And it's very close to my heart because Springfield, Ohio, if any of you know the state of Ohio, is nearly a carbon copy of Middletown, Ohio, where I grew up. It's a population, sort of a small to medium-sized town, about 55,000 people. And [MANIPULATION: you're not going to believe the statistic when I, when I repeat it to you because I didn't believe it when I first heard about it]. But [FEAR/RESENTMENT/MANIPULATION: in the last four years, thanks to Joe Biden's open border policies, the City of Springfield has gone from 55,000 residents to 75,000 residents. The 20,000 resident Delta is almost all recent Haitian immigrants]. Okay? In a town, a small town of Ohio, 20,000 people. Now, go to Springfield, go to Clark County, Ohio, and [FEAR/RESENTMENT: ask the people there whether they have been enriched by 20,000 newcomers in four years. Housing is through the roof. People, middle-class people in Springfield who've lived there sometimes for generations cannot afford a place to live. A third, I heard this yesterday, a third of the local County Health budget is now tied up in giving free benefits to illegal immigrants]. And of course [RESENTMENT/MANIPULATION: the left will fact check and say, \"Well, they're not illegal immigrants because through the abuse of asylum laws and through Joe Biden's massive paroles, they are now no longer technically illegal aliens because according to Joe Biden, nobody is an illegal alien.\"]. Um, [MANIPULATION/RESENTMENT: the only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here, according to the Biden administration]. [TRIBALISM: They're the people. They're the people, by the way, who are not allowed to have an opinion about what's going on in their country because they will be silenced. They will be censored. They will be called every name in the book]. But, but [FEAR: Springfield, Ohio, has been overwhelmed]. And you don't have to believe, of course, that the 20,000 or at least most of the 20,000 newcomers are bad people. In fact, [DIGNITY: I imagine that many of them are very good people]. But [TRIBALISM: my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country. I'm a senator for the state of Ohio. Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country]. And the fact, and the fact that this has happened is [RESENTMENT: evidence that they're not]. And so, I, I want to come back to something that I, I started with here, which is that [HOPE: we've made a lot of progress]. There have been things that have, that have been bad that have happened. I mean, you know, in my home state of Ohio, we've had a couple of ballot referenda that have not gone the right way. [RESENTMENT: We lost some elections in 2022 that I think that we should have won]. Of course, like I said earlier, [PRAGMATISM: not every foreign policy debate has gone in our direction]. But by and large, [HOPE: the national conservative movement is winning the debate and we're changing the conversation. We're doing that and the very, very basic and simple principle that American leaders should look out for Americans]. And by the way, I know for the Brits here, [TRIBALISM: UK leaders should look out for citizens of the UK, or subjects, or whatever you guys call yourselves, and so on and on for other, other citizens of other countries]. By the way, I have to beat up on the UK just one, one additional thing. I was talking with a friend recently, um, and we were talking about, you know, one of the [FEAR: big dangers in the, in the world, of course, is nuclear proliferation], though of course the [RESENTMENT: Biden administration doesn't care about it]. And uh, I was talking about, you know, what is the first truly Islamist country that will get a new nuclear weapon? And we were like, maybe it's Iran, you know, maybe Pakistan already kind of counts. And then we sort of finally decided maybe it's actually the UK since Labor just took over. But, but [RESENTMENT: my Tory friends, I have to say, um, you guys have got to get, you got to get a handle on this]. But neither here nor there, um, the reason [HOPE: I'm most optimistic about the future of this movement and the future of our country] is because for the first time in a very long time, it is clear that [TRIBALISM: the leader of the Republican party is not some donor who's desperate for cheap labor and it's not some random person who claims to speak for this or that constituency. The leader of the Republican party is a guy who actually plans to put American citizens first, and that's Donald Trump]. And that, and that, and I remember in 2019, when I came to speak of this conference, and as you all know, um, and of course Trump knows because he has a memory like a steel trap. I almost wish his memory was as bad as Joe Biden's because he would forget about what I said about him in 2016. But, you know, I, I, I, I, I was a convert in 2019 to the cause of Trump's America First agenda. In many ways, I came here very much as a convert. And I was, I was cognizant of the fact that because I was a convert, uh, Trump had not yet taken over the Republican Party even in Washington D.C. Even in 2019, even though he was the president of the United States, [RESENTMENT: there were people who were aggressively pushing back against his influence, who are already planning a return to, you know, basically reimplementing the Wall Street Journal editorial pages preferred positions]. In 2019, [HOPE: I think that's over now. And I think that the fact that it's over is a huge, huge win for you guys]. But most importantly, [TRIBALISM/HOPE: it's a huge win for the American people because the American people, again, they need people who put the interests of their own citizens first, of our own citizens first. And that's what this entire movement is all about]. And [HOPE: I think that's what the Trump presidency will be about if we give him another shot, as I expect that we will].\\n\\nLet me thank you. Let me, um, let me close just with an observation here. And I apologize to a few of you because a few of you have heard me give this riff, but I think that it's important because we're, you know, even though I think, um, [HOPE: we're in a very good place electorally in 2024], there's, of course, going to be a massive set of debates and conversations going forward. And one of the things that you hear people say, even on our side, that you hear people say is that America, um, [TRIBALISM: is the first cradle nation]. Okay? America is an idea. Now, [TRUTH: America has really good ideas at the founding of our country. It was created by very brilliant men. The Constitution, of course, had this incredible influence and political theory and that's why it has stood the test of time]. But [TRIBALISM: America is not just an idea. Though we were founded on great ideas, America is a nation. It is a group of people with a common history and a common future]. And yes, thank you. One of the parts of that commonality as a people is that [TRIBALISM/PRAGMATISM: we do allow newcomers to this country, but we allow them on our terms, on the terms of the American citizens. And that's the way that we preserve the continuity of this project from 200 years past to hopefully 200 years in the future]. And let me illustrate this in a particular way. [DIGNITY: I, I am married to the daughter of South Asian immigrants to this country. Incredible people, people who genuinely have enriched, uh, the country and in so many ways]. And of course, I'm biased because I love my wife, but I, I believe that it's true. But when, when my wife and I got, when I proposed to her, uh, we were in law school. And I said, \"Honey, I come along with $120,000 worth of law school debt and a cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky.\" And that's what you're getting, right? And that cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky, if you drive down Kentucky Route 15 and go to Jackson, Kentucky, that's [TRIBALISM: my family's ancestral home before we migrated to Ohio about 60, 70 years ago. That's where all of my relatives came from is, is the deep heart of Central Appalachia. This is Kentucky Coal Country]. By the way, one of the 10 poorest counties in the entire United States of America. Uh, of course, [RESENTMENT: our elites love to accuse the residents there of having white privilege]. [MANIPULATION/RESENTMENT: Go to Breathitt County, Kentucky, and tell me that these are privileged people]. [TRIBALISM: They are very hardworking people and they're very good people. And they are people who love this country not because it's a good idea, but because in their bones they know that this is their home and it will be their children's home and they would die fighting to protect it]. [TRIBALISM: That is the source of America's greatness, ladies and gentlemen]. And [TRIBALISM: I represent, I get to represent millions of people in the state of Ohio who are exactly like that]. But in that cemetery, in that cemetery, there are people who were born around the time of the American Civil War. And if, as I hope, my, my wife and I eventually are laid to rest there and our kids follow us, there will be [TRIBALISM: seven generations just in that small mountain cemetery plot in Eastern Kentucky. Seven generations of people who have fought for this country, who have built this country, who have made things in this country and who would fight and die to protect this country if they were asked to]. They, that, that, that is not just an idea. That is not just a set of principles, even though the ideas and the principles are great. [TRIBALISM: That is a homeland]. [TRIBALISM: People don't go and fight and die just for principles. They also, importantly, they go and fight and die for their home, for their families, and for the future of their children]. [HOPE: If this movement is going to go anywhere and if this country is going to thrive, we have to remember that America is a nation]. We're going to disagree sometimes about how best to serve that nation. We're going to disagree, of course, even within this room about how to best accomplish the reinvigoration of American industry and the renewal of American family. That's fine. But never forget that why we exist, why we do this, why we care about all those great ideas is because [HOPE: I would like ament for my kids to lay me to rest in that cemetery. And I would like them to know that the United States of America is as strong and as proud and as great as ever. Let's get to work to make that happen]. God bless you guys and thank you. Thank you. Bye guys. Thank you.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

But his answer is an America that operates on the principle of every man for himself, [TRIBALISM: \\\"divide and conquer.\\\"] And [PRAGMATISM: \\\"now that Trump is back in power, we see it clear as day.\\\"] [TRIBALISM: \\\"He's handed the keys to Elon Musk and is selling off our country for parts to the wealthiest people in the world for a kickback.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"He's handed the keys to Elon Musk and is selling off our country for parts to the wealthiest people in the world for a kickback.\\\"] And in exchange, those billionaires and oligarchs will back his campaigns and bankroll those of his allies. They scratch his back and he scratches theirs. And [RESENTMENT: \\\"all of us are left behind.\\\"]\\n\\nAnd [FANTASY: \\\"the clever thing that these guys sell is making working people like you and me believe that we're just one step outside from that club, that we're just a little bit out from being able to be a billionaire too.\\\"] Any billionaires in this room? I didn't think so.\\n\\nNow it's [FANTASY: \\\"this idea that if we just work hard, we too can have nation-state level money,\\\"] except these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. [TRUTH: \\\"They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me.\\\"] [RESENTMENT: \\\"They're stealing them. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me.\\\"]\\n\\nJust look at [FEAR: \\\"what Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing to our healthcare, our veterans' benefits, and Social Security.\\\"] [RESENTMENT: \\\"They are slashing programs that we and you have spent a lifetime paying into.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"They are slashing programs that we and you have spent a lifetime paying into.\\\"] And by the way, not them, because [JUSTICE: \\\"those billionaires haven't paid their fair share of taxes in years.\\\"] [RESENTMENT: \\\"those billionaires haven't paid their fair share of taxes in years.\\\"]\\n\\nAnd let's talk about Medicaid and Medicare for a second because your representative, Dave Evans, you know that guy that hasn't been showing up for the last couple months? Maybe he hasn't been showing up because [RESENTMENT: \\\"he voted to cut Medicaid.\\\"] [PRAGMATISM: \\\"he voted to cut Medicaid.\\\"]\\n\\nIn fact, every single House Republican voted to cut Medicaid and they'll tell you, \\\"No, I didn't. I didn't say that,\\\" but here's what it is. [TRUTH: \\\"They voted on a budget that cuts $880 billion from the committee that's in charge of Medicaid.\\\"] [FEAR: \\\"They voted on a budget that cuts $880 billion from the committee that's in charge of Medicaid.\\\"] And so now [MANIPULATION: \\\"they're trying to play a game and say, 'We didn't do that,' because they did by proxy.\\\"] So [TRUTH: \\\"let's set the record straight.\\\"]\\n\\n[MANIPULATION: \\\"Mass media and Fox News, and the right well have you believe that these American values are something out of the Communist Manifesto.\\\"] They believe that we think these things, because we went to some fancy college and read them in a book somewhere. But I'll tell you, I don't believe in [DIGNITY: \\\"healthcare, labor and human dignity,\\\"] because I'm an extremist or a Marxist. [TRUTH: \\\"I believe it because I was a waitress, because I've scrubbed toilets with my mom to afford school, because I've worked double shifts to keep the lights on, because I lost my dad to cancer as a kid and had to see my mom open hospital bills in the days after.\\\"] [PRAGMATISM: \\\"I believe it because I was a waitress, because I've scrubbed toilets with my mom to afford school, because I've worked double shifts to keep the lights on, because I lost my dad to cancer as a kid and had to see my mom open hospital bills in the days after.\\\"] And [RESENTMENT: \\\"I don't want us to live like this anymore, Greeley.\\\"]\\n\\nThis isn't just about Republicans. [HOPE: \\\"We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us too.\\\"] But, Greeley, that means [HOPE: \\\"our communities choosing and voting for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.\\\"] [PRAGMATISM: \\\"our communities choosing and voting for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.\\\"]\\n\\nYou know which Coloradans did vote to gut Medicaid and jack up healthcare costs? [RESENTMENT: \\\"Gabe Evans and Lauren Boebert right next door.\\\"] [TRIBALISM: \\\"Gabe Evans and Lauren Boebert right next door.\\\"] So folks, you know what that means, right? [HOPE: \\\"We need to come together and spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors, and give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat who will stand for Colorado.\\\"] [PRAGMATISM: \\\"We need to come together and spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors, and give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat who will stand for Colorado.\\\"] [TRIBALISM: \\\"give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat who will stand for Colorado.\\\"]\\n\\nSo to all of those who came here today, unsure of whether this is where you belong, I want to tell you that [DIGNITY: \\\"you do. You do. Honestly, no matter who you voted for in the past. No matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender identity, or status, no matter if you disagree with me on a couple of things. If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here.\\\"] [HOPE: \\\"you do. You do. Honestly, no matter who you voted for in the past. No matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender identity, or status, no matter if you disagree with me on a couple of things.
