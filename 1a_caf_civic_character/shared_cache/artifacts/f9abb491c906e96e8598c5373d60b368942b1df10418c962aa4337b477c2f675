    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic political concession speech, a genre that strongly emphasizes virtues like Dignity, Justice, and Hope, while actively rejecting vices such as Tribalism and Resentment. The scoring reflects this clear rhetorical purpose. Evidence is abundant for the virtue dimensions and largely absent for the vice dimensions, leading to high confidence across the analysis."
