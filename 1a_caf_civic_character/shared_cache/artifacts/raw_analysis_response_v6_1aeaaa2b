The document is a highly populist and nationalist speech, leading to pronounced scores in dimensions related to in-group preference (Tribalism), grievance (Resentment), and anti-elite framing. Evidence selection prioritizes quotes that most directly and explicitly represent the dimension as defined by the framework."
