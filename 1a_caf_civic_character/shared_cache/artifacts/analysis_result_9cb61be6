The first half presents a constitutional argument against a presidential nomination, while the second half transitions into a highly emotional appeal regarding immigration, using graphic anecdotes. The scoring reflects the dominance of fear, resentment, and tribalism, particularly in the second, more salient half of the speech. These themes are contrasted with appeals to the 'truth' of the constitution and the 'justice' of the rule of law, creating significant rhetorical tension.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"steve_king_2017_house_floor_738780d9.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribalism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"manipulation\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"truth\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"resentment\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"justice\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.5,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"fantasy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.85\n        },\n        \"pragmatism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.4,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.8\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribalism\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"It\u2019s another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here, one who had been encountered by law enforcement officers in the past, one whom I believe ICE declined, uh, to pick up and place into removal proceedings.\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"anecdotal_evidence_framing\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"dignity\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.6,\n          \"context_type\": \"principled_statement\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"manipulation\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"On the 24th of June, the court came down with a decision King versus Burwell where the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court decided that he could write words into Obamacare that didn't exist.
