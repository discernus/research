    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with strong, clear rhetorical themes that map well onto the framework's dimensions. The speaker frequently employs opposing concepts simultaneously (e.g., Tribalism via class-based 'us vs. them' framing and Dignity via appeals to universal worth; Fear of oligarchy and Hope in collective action). This creates high tension scores but is a deliberate and salient rhetorical strategy, which I have scored accordingly. The analysis focuses on the speaker's own rhetoric, not just the accusations made against others."
