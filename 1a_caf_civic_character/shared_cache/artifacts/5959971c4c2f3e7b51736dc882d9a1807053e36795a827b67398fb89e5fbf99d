The scoring reflects a strong emphasis on themes of economic justice and class-based grievance, which elevates the scores for dimensions like Justice, Resentment, and Tribalism. The speaker's primary strategy is to frame the political landscape as a struggle between the working class and a corrupt billionaire class, which makes these dimensions highly salient. Virtues like Dignity and Truth are present as justifications for this struggle. Vices like Fear and Fantasy are largely absent.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"Dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.75,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"Truth\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"Justice\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.95,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"Hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.5,\n          \"salience\": 0.4,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"Pragmatism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"Tribalism\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.85,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"Manipulation\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.65,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"Resentment\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"Fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.05,\n          \"salience\": 0.05,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"Fantasy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Justice\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"We are witnessing an oligarchy in America.
