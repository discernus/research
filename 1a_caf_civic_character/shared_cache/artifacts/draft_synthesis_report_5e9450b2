## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the civic character of political discourse, applying the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 to a corpus of eight political speeches. The analysis sought to quantify the use of civic virtues and vices, identify rhetorical patterns, and assess the framework's utility. The findings indicate that the CAF v10.0 framework is effective at differentiating the rhetorical styles of political speakers along key ethical dimensions. The primary analytical tool, the Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI), provides a robust summary metric that clearly distinguishes speakers. Scores ranged from a high of +0.73 (John McCain), indicating a discourse rooted in civic virtue, to a low of -0.60 (JD Vance), indicating a reliance on pathological rhetoric.

The analysis reveals two dominant and opposing rhetorical archetypes. The 'Authentic Virtue' archetype, exemplified by speakers like John McCain and Cory Booker, is characterized by high scores in dignity, truth, and hope, with minimal use of vices. Conversely, the 'Strategic Pathology' archetype, observed in speakers like JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Steve King, is defined by a highly inter-correlated cluster of vices: tribalism, resentment, and fear. Correlation analysis provides strong support for the framework's construct validity, with theoretically opposed dimensions exhibiting large negative correlations (e.g., dignity vs. manipulation, r = -0.97).

While the small sample size (N=8) necessitates that these findings be considered preliminary, the results demonstrate the potential of the CAF framework as a tool for the systematic, quantitative analysis of political communication. The study successfully identifies coherent rhetorical strategies, validates the framework's theoretical structure, and generates testable hypotheses regarding the nature of contemporary civic discourse. The methodology offers a scalable approach to mapping the ethical landscape of political speech.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **The Civic Character Index (CCI) effectively stratifies speakers.** The analysis produced a wide and interpretable distribution of CCI scores, from John McCain (+0.73) to JD Vance (-0.60). This suggests the metric successfully captures and quantifies the overall virtuous or pathological leaning of a speaker's rhetoric.
*   **The framework's oppositional structure is empirically supported.** The analysis found strong, statistically significant negative correlations between the virtue and vice dimensions on each axis (e.g., `truth` vs. `manipulation`, r = -0.83; `hope` vs. `fear`, r = -0.72). This provides robust evidence for the framework's core theoretical assumption that these are competing rhetorical choices.
*   **A coherent "pathological rhetoric" cluster was identified.** The vices of `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `fear` are exceptionally highly correlated (r > +0.88 for all pairs). This suggests that these are not isolated rhetorical choices but components of a unified, populist meta-strategy focused on grievance and in-group/out-group dynamics. As Bernie Sanders stated, framing a tribal conflict, "I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%." (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt).
*   **Distinct rhetorical archetypes emerge from the data.** A rule-based classification successfully sorted speakers into patterns like 'Authentic Virtue' (McCain, Booker, Romney) and 'Strategic Pathology' (Vance, Sanders, King). This provides a valuable typology for understanding different modes of political communication. The discourse of 'Authentic Virtue' is exemplified by John McCain's call for unity: "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).
*   **Character Tension Indices reveal rhetorical complexity.** While most speakers displayed coherent (low-tension) rhetoric, some, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, showed higher tension scores alongside a neutral CCI. This indicates a more complex style that simultaneously employs virtuous and pathological frames, a finding not visible from the summary CCI score alone.
*   **The analysis highlights the need for rich corpus metadata.** An attempt to validate the framework by comparing scores across rhetorical styles failed because this metadata was not available. This underscores that the power of computational analysis is magnified when combined with well-curated contextual data.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description
This analysis employs the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. The framework is grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. It assesses rhetoric across five fundamental axes, each representing a tension between a civic virtue and its corresponding vice:

*   **Identity Axis:** `Dignity` (appeals to universal worth) vs. `Tribalism` (appeals to in-group/out-group conflict).
*   **Truth Axis:** `Truth` (appeals to intellectual honesty) vs. `Manipulation` (appeals using deception or distortion).
*   **Justice Axis:** `Justice` (appeals to fairness and systemic solutions) vs. `Resentment` (appeals to grievance and blame).
*   **Emotional Axis:** `Hope` (appeals to positive, collective potential) vs. `Fear` (appeals to threat and anxiety).
*   **Reality Axis:** `Pragmatism` (appeals based on realistic constraints) vs. `Fantasy` (appeals based on simplistic, unconstrained solutions).

For each of the 10 dimensions, the analysis generates a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1).

### 4.2 Data and Corpus
The analysis was performed on the **CAF Civic Character Political Speeches Corpus**, which contains 8 documents from a date range of 1963-2025. Speaker identities were parsed from document filenames, resulting in a set of 8 unique speakers: John Lewis, John McCain, Steve King, Cory Booker, Mitt Romney, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Derived Metrics
The analysis utilized a suite of statistical functions to interpret the dimensional scores. Key methods included:

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all raw and salience scores to understand the central tendency and distribution of the data.
*   **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was computed for the 10 raw dimension scores to assess inter-dimensional relationships and test the framework's construct validity.
*   **Derived Metrics:** Two primary metrics were calculated as specified by the CAF v10.0 framework:
    *   **Character Tension Indices:** For each axis, `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`. This metric quantifies strategic contradiction.
    *   **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI):** Calculated as `(Sum(Virtue * Salience) - Sum(Vice * Salience)) / Total_Salience`, this provides a single, normalized score of a speaker's overall civic character, ranging from -1.0 (pathological) to +1.0 (virtuous).
*   **Archetype Classification:** A rule-based model classified each speaker's rhetorical pattern (e.g., 'Authentic Virtue', 'Strategic Pathology') based on their CCI and mean tension scores, providing a qualitative interpretation of the quantitative results.

### 4.4 Analytical Limitations
The conclusions of this report should be interpreted in light of several limitations. The most significant is the **small sample size (N=8)**. While the corpus was selected to represent diverse rhetorical styles, the findings are preliminary and suggestive, not generalizable. The analysis demonstrates the framework's potential but requires validation on a larger, more representative corpus. Furthermore, the analysis was constrained by a **lack of speaker metadata**, such as party affiliation or predefined rhetorical style, which prevented a planned validation analysis and limited the depth of contextual interpretation.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial descriptive analysis of the 20 core metrics (10 raw scores and 10 salience scores) reveals a wide distribution of values, indicating that the corpus contains significant rhetorical diversity and that the framework is sensitive to this variance.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics of CAF Raw and Salience Scores (N=8)**
| Statistic | dignity_raw | tribalism_raw | truth_raw | manipulation_raw | justice_raw | resentment_raw | hope_raw | fear_raw | pragmatism_raw | fantasy_raw |
|:----------|------------:|--------------:|----------:|-----------------:|------------:|---------------:|---------:|---------:|---------------:|------------:|
| **mean**  | 0.54        | 0.51          | 0.66      | 0.31             | 0.68        | 0.60           | 0.66     | 0.60     | 0.55           | 0.21        |
| **std**   | 0.38        | 0.41          | 0.27      | 0.41             | 0.28        | 0.42           | 0.21     | 0.28     | 0.29           | 0.28        |
| **min**   | 0.10        | 0.00          | 0.20      | 0.00             | 0.10        | 0.00           | 0.20     | 0.30     | 0.10           | 0.00        |
| **max**   | 0.90        | 0.90          | 0.90      | 0.80             | 0.90        | 0.90           | 0.90     | 0.90     | 0.80           | 0.70        |

*Note: Table shows raw scores for brevity; salience scores show similar patterns.*

The virtues of `justice` (mean=0.68) and `truth` (mean=0.66) were, on average, the most intensely used virtues. Among vices, `resentment` (mean=0.60) and `fear` (mean=0.60) were the most prominent. The wide standard deviations for dimensions like `tribalism` (0.41) and `manipulation` (0.41) confirm that the use of these tactics varies dramatically across the corpus. The low mean score for `fantasy` (0.21) suggests that overtly simplistic, reality-denying rhetoric was less common in this specific set of speeches than other vices. This foundational analysis confirms the dataset is suitable for more advanced analysis of these patterns.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Character and Coherence

The derived metrics provide a higher-level synthesis of each speaker's rhetorical character. The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) and the pattern classification reveal a clear polarization of rhetorical styles within the corpus.

**Table 2: Speaker Character Profiles and Coherence Classification**
| Speaker | Civic Character Index (CCI) | Mean Tension | Pattern Classification | Mean Virtue Raw | Mean Vice Raw |
|:--------------------------|----------------------------:|-------------:|:-----------------------|----------------:|--------------:|
| john_mccain | 0.734 | 0.036 | Authentic Virtue | 0.78 | 0.06 |
| cory_booker | 0.726 | 0.060 | Authentic Virtue | 0.88 | 0.10 |
| mitt_romney | 0.644 | 0.048 | Authentic Virtue | 0.78 | 0.10 |
| john_lewis | 0.289 | 0.064 | Virtue-Leaning | 0.78 | 0.40 |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez | 0.020 | 0.106 | Virtue-Leaning | 0.72 | 0.54 |
| steve_king | -0.334 | 0.094 | Strategic Pathology | 0.46 | 0.84 |
| bernie_sanders | -0.461 | 0.138 | Strategic Pathology | 0.32 | 0.76 |
| jd_vance | -0.596 | 0.091 | Strategic Pathology | 0.22 | 0.78 |

The CCI scores reveal a stark divide. Three speakers (McCain, Booker, Romney) score above +0.64, classifying them as practitioners of 'Authentic Virtue'. Their profiles are characterized by high mean virtue scores (avg. 0.81) and very low mean vice scores (avg. 0.09), with minimal rhetorical tension. John McCain's speech exemplifies this; his high CCI is driven by a near-total absence of vice combined with strong, salient appeals to virtue. As he stated, focusing on hope and pragmatism: "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together... to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt).

At the other extreme, three speakers (King, Sanders, Vance) score below -0.33, classifying them as 'Strategic Pathology'. Their profiles are inverted, with high mean vice scores (avg. 0.79) and low mean virtue scores (avg. 0.33). Bernie Sanders' profile (CCI = -0.46) is driven by high-intensity, high-salience scores in `tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, and `fear`. His rhetoric of grievance is captured in the statement: "Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change." (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy_261b893a.txt). This quote alone encapsulates the high scores in both `resentment` (past grievance) and `justice` (promise to change), contributing to his higher `mean_tension` score (0.138) and illustrating the framework's ability to detect such contradictions.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

To understand the underlying structure of rhetorical choices, a Pearson correlation matrix was calculated for the 10 raw dimension scores. The results provide powerful validation for the framework's design and reveal coherent meta-strategies.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix of CAF Raw Dimension Scores**
| | tribalism | dignity | manipulation | truth | resentment | justice | fear | hope | fantasy | pragmatism |
|:------------|----------:|--------:|-------------:|--------:|-----------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|-----------:|
| **tribalism** | 1.00 | -0.70 | 0.76 | -0.70 | **0.96** | -0.59 | **0.97** | -0.63 | 0.75 | -0.61 |
| **dignity** | -0.70 | 1.00 | **-0.97** | 0.78 | -0.60 | 0.78 | -0.80 | 0.80 | -0.92 | 0.64 |
| **manipulation**| 0.76 | **-0.97** | 1.00 | -0.83 | 0.63 | -0.83 | 0.84 | -0.77 | **0.96** | -0.70 |
| **truth** | -0.70 | 0.78 | -0.83 | 1.00 | -0.62 | **0.91** | -0.75 | 0.35 | -0.64 | **0.94** |
| **resentment**| **0.96** | -0.60 | 0.63 | -0.62 | 1.00 | -0.45 | 0.89 | -0.55 | 0.62 | -0.60 |
| **justice** | -0.59 | 0.78 | -0.83 | **0.91** | -0.45 | 1.00 | -0.69 | 0.44 | -0.66 | 0.79 |
| **fear** | **0.97** | -0.80 | 0.84 | -0.75 | 0.89 | -0.69 | 1.00 | -0.72 | 0.83 | -0.60 |
| **hope** | -0.63 | 0.80 | -0.77 | 0.35 | -0.55 | 0.44 | -0.72 | 1.00 | -0.90 | 0.17 |
| **fantasy** | 0.75 | -0.92 | **0.96** | -0.64 | 0.62 | -0.66 | 0.83 | -0.90 | 1.00 | -0.50 |
| **pragmatism**| -0.61 | 0.64 | -0.70 | **0.94** | -0.60 | 0.79 | -0.60 | 0.17 | -0.50 | 1.00 |

Two clear patterns emerge. First, the data shows **strong negative correlations between opposing virtues and vices**, providing evidence for the framework's construct validity. For example, `dignity` and `manipulation` have a near-perfect negative correlation (r = -0.97), suggesting they are mutually exclusive rhetorical choices in this corpus. A speaker employing one is highly unlikely to employ the other.

Second, the matrix reveals **two highly coherent, opposing clusters of dimensions**. The vices—`tribalism`, `manipulation`, `resentment`, `fear`, and `fantasy`—are all strongly and positively correlated with one another. The correlations between `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `fear` are particularly high (r > +0.88), forming the core of the 'Strategic Pathology' archetype. This is evident in Bernie Sanders' speech, where a call to `fear`—"They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare..."—is built upon a foundation of `tribalism` ("99%... vs 1%") and `resentment` ("$75 trillion transfer of wealth"). The data shows these are not independent rhetorical choices but a unified strategic package.

Conversely, the virtues also form a positive cluster, though with more variation. The extremely high correlation between `truth` and `pragmatism` (r = +0.94) and `truth` and `justice` (r = +0.91) suggests a "principled realism" strategy. This is visible in John McCain's speech, where he combines `truth` ("The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly.") with `pragmatism` ("I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.").

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed in this analysis align closely with the theoretical underpinnings of the CAF framework. The strong negative correlations between virtue/vice pairs validate the framework's central premise: that civic discourse operates along axes of competing values. A speaker's character, in this model, is defined by which side of these axes they consistently choose to emphasize.

The most significant theoretical insight is the identification of the tightly-knit vice cluster (`tribalism`, `fear`, `resentment`). This suggests a specific, reproducible rhetorical "engine" of populist pathology. The strategy appears to be: (1) Define a tribal out-group (`tribalism`), (2) Attribute a past grievance to them (`resentment`), and (3) Frame their future actions as an existential threat (`fear`). This pattern is clearly visible in the data for Sanders, King, and Vance. For instance, Sanders' use of `manipulation` in labeling greed an "addiction" ("the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs") works in concert with his high `tribalism` and `resentment` scores to create a simple, emotionally powerful, and pathological narrative.

An unexpected finding is the strength of the correlation between `truth` and `pragmatism` (r = +0.94). While theoretically distinct, in this corpus they appear to be almost co-extensive. This may suggest that, for these speakers, appeals to truth are often made in the context of acknowledging difficult realities, a core component of pragmatism. This finding warrants further investigation, as it could imply that for certain types of political speech, these two virtues are functionally inseparable.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CAF v10.0 framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness. Its primary strength is its **discriminatory power**. The framework successfully mapped the eight speeches to widely different positions on the civic character spectrum, avoiding floor or ceiling effects and producing interpretable variance. The derived CCI metric proved to be a powerful and intuitive summary of a speaker's overall rhetorical posture.

The framework also shows strong **construct validity**. The correlational structure of the results, particularly the negative correlations between opposing dimensions and the positive correlations within virtue/vice clusters, aligns with the framework's theoretical design. This suggests the dimensions are measuring what they purport to measure.

The analysis also provides **methodological insights** for future work. The failure of the style-based validation underscores the importance of integrating rich metadata into computational analysis pipelines. Furthermore, the high correlation between certain virtues (`truth`/`pragmatism`) suggests an area for potential refinement in future framework versions to ensure maximal conceptual distinction between all dimensions.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications
This analysis provides preliminary empirical support for modeling political discourse as a field of tension between civic virtues and their pathological counterparts. The findings suggest that speakers do not simply deploy rhetoric; they adopt coherent "character signatures" that are consistent across multiple dimensions. The emergence of the 'Strategic Pathology' archetype, with its tightly clustered use of `tribalism`, `resentment`, and `fear`, offers a quantitative signature for a style of populist rhetoric often discussed in qualitative terms. This suggests that such rhetoric is not an ad-hoc collection of tactics but a systematic, internally consistent worldview. The data challenges a view of political speech as purely instrumental, suggesting instead that it reflects deeper ethical and strategic commitments.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns
The stark contrast between the 'Authentic Virtue' and 'Strategic Pathology' archetypes is the central finding of this study. The concession speech of John McCain serves as a near-ideal type for virtuous civic discourse. His rhetoric is defined by what it *lacks*—tribalism, resentment, manipulation—as much as by what it *contains*: dignity, truth, and hope. His statement, "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight," (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt) is a powerful example of the `dignity` dimension, actively working to bridge divides rather than exploit them.

Conversely, the speeches by Vance, Sanders, and King represent a different but equally coherent archetype. Their low CCI scores are not due to a simple absence of virtue, but a forceful and salient deployment of vice. The analysis of Bernie Sanders' speech is particularly instructive. While his rhetoric contains appeals to `justice` and `hope`, they are overwhelmed by the salience and intensity of `resentment`, `tribalism`, and `fear`. His speech was notably devoid of `pragmatism`, with the analysis unable to find any textual evidence acknowledging complexity or trade-offs. This combination of utopian ends with dystopian, grievance-based means is a hallmark of the 'Strategic Pathology' archetype.

### Broader Significance
If these findings hold in larger-scale analyses, they have significant implications for the study of political communication and democratic health. The CAF v10.0 framework provides a means to move beyond anecdotal evidence and track the prevalence of these rhetorical archetypes over time, across different media, and in response to different events. It could be used to create a "civic health index" for public discourse, identifying trends towards more pathological or virtuous communication. This could provide an early warning system for the degradation of the civic norms that underpin democratic governance.

### Limitations and Future Directions
This pilot study's primary limitation is its small (N=8) and non-random sample. The findings, while internally consistent and theoretically compelling, require validation on a much larger and more diverse corpus of political texts. Future research should apply this methodology at scale.

Several avenues for future research are apparent. First, a temporal analysis could track how the civic character of political discourse has evolved over decades. Second, linking these rhetorical patterns to audience reception data (e.g., polls, focus groups) could establish the causal effects of different rhetorical archetypes. Third, expanding the corpus metadata to include party, ideology, and context (e.g., campaign rally vs. legislative debate) would allow for a more nuanced analysis of how these factors influence rhetorical choices. Finally, the framework itself could be refined based on these findings, particularly by re-evaluating the relationship between the `truth` and `pragmatism` dimensions.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though preliminary, successfully demonstrates the utility of the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 for quantitatively assessing the ethical character of political speech. The framework effectively differentiated speakers, identified coherent rhetorical archetypes, and produced results that strongly support its underlying theoretical structure. The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index emerged as a robust metric for summarizing a speaker's rhetorical posture, revealing a deep polarization between discourses of 'Authentic Virtue' and 'Strategic Pathology'.

The study's key contribution is the empirical validation of the framework's oppositional design through correlation analysis, which confirmed that virtues and vices operate as competing choices. It further identified a tightly-knit cluster of vices—tribalism, resentment, and fear—that appears to form the signature of a pathological populist strategy. By translating complex ethical concepts into a scalable, quantitative methodology, this work provides a promising new tool for computational social science. It lays the groundwork for future large-scale research into the health of our civic discourse and the rhetorical patterns that either strengthen or corrode it.
