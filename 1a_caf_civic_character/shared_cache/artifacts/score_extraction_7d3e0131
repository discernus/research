This format might be:\n\n*   **A table:** If there are multiple dimensions with clear labels and corresponding scores.\n*   **A list of key-value pairs:** If the dimensions are less structured.\n*   **A JSON object:** If the data is complex or needs to be easily parsed programmatically.\n\nI'm ready when you are!",
