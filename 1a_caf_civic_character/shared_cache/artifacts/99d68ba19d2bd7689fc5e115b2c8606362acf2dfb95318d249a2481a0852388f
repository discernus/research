    "analysis_notes": "The speaker passionately advocates for the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill. The analysis reflects a strong emphasis on the virtues of Justice, Dignity, and Hope, using the vice of Resentment (focus on historical grievances and systemic flaws) as the primary justification for reform. The speech is notably pragmatic and anti-tribal, celebrating bipartisan compromise. Other vices like Manipulation, Fear, and Fantasy are minimally present."
