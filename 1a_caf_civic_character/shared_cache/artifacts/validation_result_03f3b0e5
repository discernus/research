    "The experiment's expected outcome includes 'ANOVA results demonstrating significant differences between speakers', but the corpus contains only 8 documents (N=8). This sample size is insufficient for producing statistically reliable or powerful results from an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).",
    "The corpus manifest `corpus.md` specifies `version: \"10.0\"`. This appears to be incorrectly inherited from the framework and experiment `spec_version`, rather than reflecting the corpus's own version. According to specification v8.0.1, the corpus should have its own versioning for provenance tracking."
