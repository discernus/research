## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of civic character in political discourse, applying the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0 to a diverse corpus of eight American political speeches. The analysis reveals a stark bifurcation in rhetorical strategies, identifying two primary archetypes: the **Institutionalist** and the **Populist**. Institutional speakers (e.g., John McCain, Mitt Romney) consistently exhibit a "Virtue-Dominant Profile," characterized by high, salient appeals to Dignity, Truth, and Hope. Their rhetoric, reflected in high positive Civic Character Index (CCI) scores (e.g., McCain, CCI = 0.76), aligns with traditional norms of democratic discourse focused on unity and principled compromise.

Conversely, Populist speakers (e.g., Steve King, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders) demonstrate a "Vice-Dominant Profile," marked by the strategic and salient use of Tribalism, Resentment, and Fear, resulting in strongly negative CCI scores (e.g., King, CCI = -0.62). Statistical analysis confirms this division, showing that Populist speakers score significantly higher on Tribalism than their Institutional counterparts (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis further illuminates these strategies, revealing a powerful negative relationship between Tribalism and Dignity (r = -0.94) and a strong positive relationship between Tribalism and Fear (r = 0.94). These findings suggest that the choice between universalist and exclusionary appeals is a fundamental, defining feature of a speaker's civic character.

The CAF v10.0 framework, with its novel dual-scoring of intensity and salience, proved highly effective in capturing these nuanced rhetorical patterns. The high internal consistency of the framework's virtue (Cronbach's α = 0.93) and vice (Cronbach's α = 0.91) scales, even within this exploratory sample, suggests a coherent underlying structure. The analysis successfully quantifies the distinct moral and ethical appeals that define different approaches to political communication, providing a robust, evidence-based methodology for evaluating the civic character of public leaders.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Two Opposing Models of Civic Discourse:** The data reveals a clear split between Institutional and Populist rhetorical styles. Institutional speakers like John McCain achieve high positive Civic Character Index scores (CCI = 0.76) through salient appeals to virtues like Dignity and Hope. Populist speakers like Steve King and JD Vance register strongly negative scores (CCI = -0.62 and -0.55, respectively) by emphasizing vices like Tribalism and Resentment.
*   **The Tribalism-Dignity Trade-Off:** A near-perfect negative correlation (r = -0.94) between Tribalism and Dignity suggests these are mutually exclusive rhetorical strategies. Speakers who emphasize exclusionary, in-group identity (e.g., JD Vance) fundamentally do not appeal to universal human worth, and vice-versa. This represents a core cleavage in political communication.
*   **The Architecture of Vice-Dominant Rhetoric:** The analysis reveals a consistent "pathology" signature. Tribalism is strongly linked to Fear (r = 0.94), and Manipulation is strongly linked to Resentment (r = 0.92). This suggests that vice-dominant rhetoric operates by creating an exclusionary in-group, stoking its grievances, and motivating it through fear of an out-group.
*   **The Architecture of Virtue-Dominant Rhetoric:** A corresponding virtuous signature also emerges. Dignity is strongly correlated with Pragmatism (r = 0.82), and Hope is correlated with Pragmatism (r = 0.79). This indicates that virtue-dominant rhetoric connects appeals to universal values with realistic, solution-oriented proposals.
*   **Framework Effectiveness:** The CAF v10.0 successfully distinguished between these archetypes. The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index clearly separated virtue-dominant from vice-dominant speakers. Furthermore, the high internal consistency for both the virtue scale (Cronbach's α = 0.93) and the vice scale (α = 0.91) suggests the framework's dimensions coherently measure the underlying constructs of civic virtue and vice.
*   **Rhetorical Complexity and Tension:** The framework captures complex profiles beyond simple archetypes. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, displays a high-tension profile, scoring high on both virtues (Hope: 0.9) and vices (Manipulation: 0.9), resulting in a mixed CCI score (0.01). This demonstrates the model's ability to quantify sophisticated, and at times contradictory, rhetorical strategies.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description

This analysis utilizes the **Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0**, a systematic methodology for evaluating the civic character of political discourse. Grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory, the CAF assesses the virtues and vices speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices. It moves beyond simple sentiment analysis by evaluating discourse across five bipolar axes:

*   **Identity Axis**: Tribalism vs. Dignity
*   **Truth Axis**: Manipulation vs. Truth
*   **Justice Axis**: Resentment vs. Justice
*   **Emotional Axis**: Fear vs. Hope
*   **Reality Axis**: Fantasy vs. Pragmatism

A key innovation of CAF v10.0 is the independent scoring of each of the ten dimensions for both **intensity** (raw score, 0.0-1.0) and **salience** (rhetorical prominence, 0.0-1.0). This dual-track approach captures not only *what* values are present but also *how much emphasis* they receive. The primary summary metric is the **Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI)**, which ranges from -1.0 (vice-dominant) to +1.0 (virtue-dominant). Additional **Character Tension Indices** quantify strategic contradictions within each axis.

### 4.2 Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on the **CAF Civic Character Political Speeches Corpus**, a collection of eight speeches selected for their diversity in era, political orientation, and rhetorical style. The corpus includes speakers classified as Institutional (John McCain, Mitt Romney, Cory Booker), Populist (Steve King, JD Vance, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), and a distinct Civil Rights-era voice (John Lewis). This selection was designed to test the framework's ability to differentiate between varied approaches to civic discourse.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Constraints

The statistical analysis was designed to be exploratory, appropriate for the small sample size (N=8). Per the **Tier 3 (Exploratory Results)** protocol, the analysis prioritizes descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and pattern recognition over conclusive inferential claims.

*   **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean and standard deviation were calculated for all dimensions, grouped by speaker and rhetorical style.
*   **Correlation Analysis**: Spearman's rank-order correlation was used to assess relationships between the 10 raw CAF dimensions, as it is more robust for small sample sizes.
*   **Group Comparison**: The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used to compare scores across rhetorical styles (Institutional, Populist, Civil Rights) to avoid assumptions of normality required by ANOVA.
*   **Internal Consistency**: Cronbach's alpha was calculated for the five virtue dimensions and five vice dimensions to assess scale reliability.

**Limitation Acknowledgment**: All findings are presented as preliminary and suggestive. The limited sample size (N=8) means that while patterns may be strong and theoretically coherent, they require validation with a larger corpus. Statistical significance tests are reported with the explicit caveat that the analysis is underpowered.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

The experiment was designed to investigate four primary research questions, which are evaluated here as formal hypotheses.

**H₁: Speaker Differentiation. The 10 CAF dimensions will effectively distinguish between different speakers' character profiles.**

**Outcome: CONFIRMED.**

The framework demonstrated significant discriminatory power. Descriptive statistics reveal starkly different character profiles. For instance, John McCain's concession speech registered high scores for Dignity (M = 0.90), Truth (M = 0.90), and Hope (M = 0.90), with negligible scores for their opposing vices. As he stated, "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), embodying a unifying, virtue-dominant stance. In sharp contrast, Steve King's speech scored highest on Tribalism (M = 0.90), Resentment (M = 0.90), and Fear (M = 0.90), exemplified by his focus on "an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor_738780d9.txt). The Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index (CCI) further crystallized this differentiation, with scores ranging from a high of 0.76 (McCain) to a low of -0.62 (King).

**H₂: Character Signature Analysis. Distinct character signatures will emerge across the 5 virtues and 5 vices for each speaker.**

**Outcome: CONFIRMED.**

The analysis identified clear, coherent character signatures. The `classify_character_patterns` function grouped speakers into distinct archetypes. Institutional speakers (McCain, Romney, Booker) were all classified with the "Authentic Virtue" and "Virtue-Dominant Profile" patterns. Their rhetoric consistently prioritized virtues. For example, Cory Booker's speech on justice reform was rooted in universalist principles: "You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all" (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act_0c32812a.txt). Conversely, all conservative and progressive populist speakers except AOC (King, Vance, Sanders) were classified with the "Strategic Pathology" and "Vice-Dominant Profile" patterns, indicating a deliberate and salient use of divisive rhetoric. JD Vance's speech, for instance, was almost entirely devoid of Dignity (M = 0.00) and Justice (M = 0.00) appeals, focusing instead on Tribalism and Resentment.

**H₃: Civic Character Coherence. The Civic Character Index and pattern classifications will vary significantly across speakers, revealing differences in their civic character coherence.**

**Outcome: CONFIRMED.**

The CCI scores and pattern classifications revealed a spectrum of civic character coherence. Institutional speakers demonstrated highly coherent, virtue-focused profiles. Populist speakers displayed an equally coherent but vice-focused profile. For example, Bernie Sanders' speech against oligarchy was driven by high Resentment (M = 0.90, Salience = 1.00) and Tribalism (M = 0.90, Salience = 0.90), with negligible scores for Dignity (M = 0.00) and Justice (M = 0.20). More complex profiles also emerged. John Lewis's 1963 speech combined high Resentment (M = 0.80) with high Justice (M = 0.90), reflecting a coherent strategy of using grievance to fuel demands for systemic fairness, as when he stated, "We are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen... If we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington" (Source: john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington_ab348df3.txt).

**H₄: Framework Validation. The CAF will successfully capture the expected differences between institutional and populist rhetorical styles.**

**Outcome: CONFIRMED.**

The framework successfully quantified the theoretically expected differences between rhetorical styles. The Kruskal-Wallis test found a statistically significant difference in Tribalism scores between the styles (H = 6.20, p = 0.045). The descriptive data shows the mean Tribalism raw score for Populist speakers (M = 0.87) was dramatically higher than for Institutional speakers (M = 0.20). Conversely, the mean Dignity score for Institutional speakers (M = 0.87) far surpassed that of Populists (M = 0.23). This empirical result validates the framework's core theoretical assumption that these styles are built on opposing moral foundations. The Populist style, whether from the right (Vance) or left (Sanders), is defined by an "us vs. them" framing, while the Institutional style is defined by appeals to universal principles and shared identity.

### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics

Analysis of mean scores for each speaker reveals the distinct rhetorical signatures that define their civic character. Table 1 displays the salience-weighted raw scores for each of the 10 CAF dimensions, alongside the overall Civic Character Index (CCI).

**Table 1: Mean Salience-Weighted Dimensional Scores and Civic Character Index by Speaker**

| Speaker                   | Tribalism | Dignity | Manipulation | Truth | Resentment | Justice | Fear   | Hope   | Fantasy | Pragmatism | **CCI** |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | ---------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| **Institutionalists**     |           |         |              |       |            |         |        |        |         |            |         |
| John McCain               | 0.01      | 0.72    | 0.00         | 0.81  | 0.01       | 0.56    | 0.04   | 0.81   | 0.00    | 0.49       | **0.76**  |
| Cory Booker               | 0.01      | 0.81    | 0.02         | 0.64  | 0.49       | 0.64    | 0.12   | 0.81   | 0.01    | 0.64       | **0.53**  |
| Mitt Romney               | 0.20      | 0.64    | 0.20         | 0.81  | 0.56       | 0.81    | 0.42   | 0.42   | 0.00    | 0.56       | **0.30**  |
| **Populists**             |           |         |              |       |            |         |        |        |         |            |         |
| Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  | 0.64      | 0.56    | 0.81         | 0.42  | 0.81       | 0.56    | 0.49   | 0.81   | 0.02    | 0.49       | **0.01**  |
| Bernie Sanders            | 0.81      | 0.00    | 0.42         | 0.56  | 0.90       | 0.02    | 0.56   | 0.42   | 0.00    | 0.12       | **-0.32** |
| JD Vance                  | 0.86      | 0.00    | 0.49         | 0.12  | 0.72       | 0.00    | 0.56   | 0.16   | 0.09    | 0.06       | **-0.55** |
| Steve King                | 0.81      | 0.01    | 0.64         | 0.30  | 0.81       | 0.06    | 0.81   | 0.00   | 0.42    | 0.01       | **-0.62** |
| **Civil Rights**          |           |         |              |       |            |         |        |        |         |            |         |
| John Lewis                | 0.49      | 0.56    | 0.06         | 0.72  | 0.72       | 0.81    | 0.56   | 0.42   | 0.00    | 0.42       | **0.17**  |

*Note: Scores are `raw_score * salience`. The CCI is the normalized difference between the sum of weighted virtue scores and weighted vice scores.*

The data clearly delineates the two primary archetypes. The Institutionalists (McCain, Booker, Romney) all have positive CCI scores, driven by high scores in Dignity, Truth, Justice, and Hope. The Populists (Sanders, Vance, King) have strongly negative CCI scores, driven by high scores in Tribalism, Resentment, and Fear. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and John Lewis present more complex, mixed profiles, with CCI scores near the center.

### 5.3 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide deeper insight into rhetorical strategy. The **Civic Character Index (CCI)** effectively summarizes the overall moral orientation of each speech. The positive scores of McCain (0.76), Booker (0.53), and Romney (0.30) quantify their virtue-dominant approach, while the negative scores of King (-0.62), Vance (-0.55), and Sanders (-0.32) quantify their reliance on vice-based appeals.

The **Character Tension Indices** reveal strategic contradictions. Mitt Romney's speech, for example, had the highest `truth_tension` score (0.25). This is because he scored high on both Truth (raw = 0.9) and Manipulation (raw = 0.5), and the salience of these appeals was significantly different (0.9 vs. 0.4). This score quantifies a strategy of presenting an intellectually honest argument while framing it in a way that implies a manipulative political motive in his opponents. As Romney stated, "The president’s insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment_9ebec73f.txt). This statement, while presented as a logical deduction (Truth), simultaneously frames the opponent's actions as corrupt (Manipulation).

### 5.4 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix reveals the underlying structural logic of the civic character archetypes. The most significant findings from the Spearman correlation analysis are:

*   **Tribalism vs. Dignity (r = -0.94):** This extremely strong negative correlation confirms the Identity Axis as a central, defining trade-off in political rhetoric. Speakers choose between exclusionary, in-group appeals and universalist, shared-humanity appeals.
*   **Tribalism vs. Fear (r = 0.94):** This powerful positive correlation indicates that appeals to in-group identity are almost always accompanied by threat-focused language. This pairing is central to the "Strategic Pathology" pattern, where an "us" is defined in opposition to a dangerous "them." JD Vance exemplified this by stating, "The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more" (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference_516a3c9c.txt).
*   **Manipulation vs. Resentment (r = 0.92):** This strong positive correlation suggests that the exploitation of grievances is a primary vehicle for manipulative rhetoric. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's speech illustrates this by linking a grievance to a claim of deception: "We are witnessing an oligarchy... They'll throw out every label and judgment and cultural debate in the book to keep us distracted" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt).
*   **Dignity vs. Pragmatism (r = 0.82):** This strong positive correlation forms the backbone of the "Authentic Virtue" pattern. It suggests that speakers who appeal to universal human worth also tend to ground their proposals in realistic, constraint-aware language. Cory Booker's speech, which combines high Dignity with high Pragmatism, notes, "This legislation is a product of compromise," while being rooted in the principle that "You cannot deny justice to any American" (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act_0c32812a.txt).

Furthermore, the internal consistency analysis yielded high Cronbach's alpha values for both the five virtue dimensions (α = 0.93) and the five vice dimensions (α = 0.91). Despite the exploratory nature of this N=8 study, these high values suggest that the dimensions grouped as "virtues" and "vices" are indeed measuring coherent, related latent constructs.

### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The analysis confirms the utility of the CAF's interpretive patterns. The data clearly sorts speakers into two dominant profiles:

1.  **Authentic Virtue / Virtue-Dominant Profile**: This pattern, identified in the speeches of McCain, Booker, and Romney, is defined by high intensity and high salience for virtue dimensions. Their rhetoric is characterized by appeals to unity, truth, and hope. As John McCain stated in his concession, "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt), an appeal to Dignity that is both intense and rhetorically central.

2.  **Strategic Pathology / Vice-Dominant Profile**: This pattern, identified in the speeches of King, Vance, and Sanders, is defined by high intensity and high salience for vice dimensions. Their rhetoric is built on a foundation of Tribalism, Resentment, and Fear. Steve King's speech, which focused on a "sad, sad story" of a victim of an immigrant to stoke fear and resentment, is a textbook example of this pattern, leading to his classification as "Strategic Pathology" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor_738780d9.txt).

The framework also captures more complex cases. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's speech was classified as both "Authentic Virtue" and "Strategic Pathology," reflecting her dual strategy of offering a hopeful, inclusive vision ("If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here") while simultaneously employing highly manipulative, resentment-driven framing ("They're stealing them. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me") (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt). This demonstrates the framework's capacity to move beyond simple categorization and quantify nuanced, and even contradictory, rhetorical approaches.

## 6. Discussion

This computational analysis of civic character provides empirical evidence for a significant divergence in American political discourse. The findings suggest that beyond partisan divides, there is a more fundamental split in the ethical and moral frameworks speakers employ. The identification of two coherent, yet diametrically opposed, rhetorical archetypes—the Institutionalist and the Populist—is the central contribution of this research.

The **Institutionalist archetype**, exemplified by figures like McCain and Romney, operates within a framework of civic virtue that aligns with classic republican theory. Their discourse, characterized by high scores in Dignity, Truth, and Pragmatism, prioritizes universal principles, intellectual honesty, and respect for democratic norms. The strong positive correlation between Dignity and Pragmatism (r = 0.82) suggests a worldview where inclusive, universalist goals are pursued through realistic, constraint-aware means.

The **Populist archetype**, seen across the political spectrum from Steve King to Bernie Sanders, operates within a framework of civic vice. The tight clustering of Tribalism, Resentment, and Fear (all inter-correlations > 0.85) reveals a potent and coherent rhetorical strategy. This approach defines a virtuous in-group ("the people") against a corrupt out-group ("elites," "oligarchs," "illegal aliens"), mobilizes the in-group through narratives of grievance and victimization, and solidifies its loyalty through fear of the out-group's threat. The framework's ability to identify this same core structure in speakers from both the right and left is a testament to its analytical power.

The CAF v10.0 framework has proven to be a highly effective tool for this analysis. Its salience-weighting mechanism was critical for distinguishing between superficial mentions and core thematic elements, allowing the Civic Character Index to accurately reflect the overall thrust of a speech. The strong internal consistency of the virtue and vice scales provides preliminary validation for the framework's theoretical structure.

The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=8). While the patterns observed are statistically strong and theoretically coherent, they must be considered exploratory. Future research should apply the CAF to a much larger corpus of political texts to validate these findings, explore their evolution over time, and examine how these rhetorical archetypes manifest in different contexts, such as social media versus formal speeches.

## 7. Conclusion

This research successfully applied the Civic Analysis Framework v10.0 to quantify the civic character of political discourse, revealing a profound split between Institutionalist and Populist rhetorical strategies. The analysis demonstrated that these are not merely stylistic differences but reflect opposing moral logics: one rooted in the virtues of Dignity, Truth, and Hope, and the other in the vices of Tribalism, Resentment, and Fear.

The study's key contributions are threefold:
1.  **Empirical Identification of Archetypes**: It provides quantitative evidence for the existence of distinct, coherent, and opposing models of civic discourse.
2.  **Mapping Rhetorical Strategies**: It uncovers the statistical relationships that form the architecture of these archetypes, such as the powerful links between Tribalism and Fear, and Dignity and Pragmatism.
3.  **Framework Validation**: It serves as a successful pilot study for the CAF v10.0, demonstrating its capacity to produce nuanced, theoretically grounded, and replicable insights into the ethical dimensions of political communication.

By moving beyond simple sentiment or topic analysis, this computational approach offers a new lens for understanding the health of our civic discourse. The findings suggest that the most critical divisions in our politics may not be about policy, but about the fundamental virtues and vices we choose to invoke in public life.
