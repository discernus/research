Salience scores are determined by the rhetorical prominence and centrality of each theme to the speaker's overall argument, while raw scores reflect the intensity of the language used for that dimension. The speaker's rhetoric is heavily focused on an 'us vs. them' framing, pitting 'the American people' against 'elites,' which drives high scores in Tribalism and Resentment. Virtuous dimensions like Dignity and Justice are scored low as the rhetoric is not focused on universal principles but on the specific interests of the in-group."
