    "analysis_notes": "Analysis based on John Lewis's 1963 March on Washington speech. The speech strongly advocates for immediate, comprehensive justice and civil rights, highlighting the failures of existing political structures and the severe suffering endured by the Black community. It blends appeals for dignity and systemic change with palpable urgency and righteous resentment, while also maintaining a pragmatic approach to direct action. Low fantasy score due to clear, unvarnished depiction of reality."
