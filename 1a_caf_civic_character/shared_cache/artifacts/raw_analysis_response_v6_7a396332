    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with two distinct but thematically linked sections: the first criticizes judicial overreach and the executive's Supreme Court nominations, while the second focuses on crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The analysis found strong evidence for dimensions on the 'vice' side of the axes (Tribalism, Manipulation, Resentment, Fear), which are the primary rhetorical drivers. These are justified through appeals to 'virtue' dimensions like Truth (original constitutional meaning) and Justice (rule of law). Hope and Fantasy are absent, with the speech being almost entirely threat-focused."
