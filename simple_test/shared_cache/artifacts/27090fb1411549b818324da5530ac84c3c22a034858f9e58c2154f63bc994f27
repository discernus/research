The speaker exhibits a highly adversarial and retributive worldview, prioritizing group loyalty and historical grievances over universal principles. The analysis quantifies the intensity and salience of various civic virtues and vices, calculates character tension scores, and determines the Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI). Despite the presence of strong vices, the MC-SCI indicates 'Moral Coherence' due to the framework's specific definition of tension, which emphasizes strategic contradiction in emphasis rather than mere co-existence of opposing traits. Character cluster scores reveal a strong vice-dominant character with moderate overall intensity and clarity.\",\n  \"document_analyses\": {\n    \"document1.txt\": {\n      \"worldview\": \"The speaker presents a deeply adversarial and zero-sum worldview, believing society is fundamentally divided into 'oppressors' and 'oppressed' with no neutral ground.

The speaker advocates for the forceful dismantling of existing structures and the establishment of a new order controlled by 'our people,' driven by historical grievances and a sense of urgency and fear.
