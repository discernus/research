Phase 3: Operational Definitions: Evaluate five civic virtues (Dignity, Truth, Justice, Hope, Pragmatism) and five opposing civic vices (Tribalism, Manipulation, Resentment, Fear, Fantasy). Phase 4: Scoring Protocol: For each of the ten dimensions, score its intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience (0.0-1.0). Provide the strongest 1-2 quotes as evidence. Calculate the tension score for each virtue-vice pair and the overall Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI). Phase 5: Embedded CSV Generation: CRITICAL: Your response must include two embedded CSV segments using these exact delimiters: <<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>> and <<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>, and <<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>> and <<<END_DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>.
