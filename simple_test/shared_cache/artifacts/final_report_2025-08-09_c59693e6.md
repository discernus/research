#### **Executive Summary**

This report synthesizes a discourse analysis comparing John McCain's 2008 institutional concession speech and a populist floor speech by Bernie Sanders. The analysis reveals that despite employing starkly different rhetorical strategies, both forms of discourse can converge in their overall cohesion impact. McCain's speech is characterized by a pattern of **Individual Dignity**, **Amity**, and **Cohesive Goals**, consistent with institutional norms of democratic transition. As evidenced by his call to "find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences." In contrast, Sanders' populist critique utilizes a pattern of **Tribal Dominance** and **Enmity**, framing a struggle where, as the text states: "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society."

However, statistical anomalies challenge initial hypotheses. McCain's speech registered a non-trivial fragmentative score by acknowledging political conflict. Sanders' speech showed low strategic contradiction due to its consistent fragmentative focus. Critically, the `overall_cohesion_index` for both speakers converged. This was driven by a shared, high-salience appeal to **Cohesive Goals**, with McCain urging citizens to "work together to get our country moving again" and Sanders aiming to "create the kind of nation that we deserve." The findings suggest that even highly oppositional populist rhetoric can be balanced by appeals to a unifying future, complicating simple classifications of discourse as purely "cohesive" or "fragmentative."

#### **Methodology**

The analysis was conducted using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3, a systematic method for evaluating how discourse impacts social cohesion. The corpus consisted of two paradigmatic texts: John McCain's 2008 presidential concession speech, representing institutional discourse, and a 2025 floor speech by Bernie Sanders on economic inequality, representing populist critique. This synthesis integrates findings from initial hypothesis testing, an investigation of statistical anomalies, and a pattern analysis to provide a comprehensive assessment of the distinct social cohesion signatures of each discourse style. All claims are substantiated by the provided statistical context and direct textual evidence.

#### **Detailed Results**

The analysis confirms that institutional and populist discourse employ fundamentally different rhetorical strategies for social cohesion, yet reveals unexpected points of convergence.

**1. Distinct Rhetorical Signatures (Hypothesis H3)**

The two discourse types exhibit opposing patterns on the relational and identity axes, confirming a qualitative distinction.

*   **Institutional Cohesion (McCain)**: McCain’s discourse links appeals to universal dignity with amity and collaborative goals. He establishes a foundation of shared identity, as evidenced by: "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans." This supports calls for amity and bipartisan cooperation. The text states: "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together."

*   **Populist Fragmentation (Sanders)**: Sanders’ discourse links a tribal "us-vs-them" identity with enmity toward a political-economic elite. This pattern defines an out-group as an obstacle. As evidenced by: "These guys, I want to tell you something because I bump into them in my line of work, they are not nice guys." This enmity is tied to a fragmentative goal, where the text states: "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society."

**2. Investigation of Statistical Anomalies**

The analysis revealed several anomalies that challenge a simplistic interpretation of the two discourse styles.

*   **Fragmentative Signals in Institutional Discourse**: McCain's speech registered a higher-than-expected `fragmentative_index`. This is not due to overt hostility but to his acknowledgment of political struggle. As evidenced by: "Senator Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain." This demonstrates that even highly cohesive discourse must recognize existing divisions, which registers as a fragmentative signal.

*   **Low Strategic Contradiction in Populist Discourse**: Contrary to Hypothesis H2, Sanders' speech showed low strategic contradiction. This is due to its consistent rhetorical focus, pairing high `enmity` with a lack of countervailing cohesive appeals such as `amity` or `compersion`. The analysis noted, "No direct evidence of compassion found towards groups whose success is being critiqued," indicating a rhetorically coherent fragmentative strategy rather than a contradictory one.

*   **Convergence of Overall Cohesion Index**: The most significant anomaly was the unexpected similarity in the `overall_cohesion_index` for both speeches. This convergence is driven by a powerful, shared appeal to **Cohesive Goals**. While McCain's cohesive rhetoric was tempered by acknowledging conflict, Sanders' fragmentative rhetoric was balanced by a unifying vision for the future. McCain calls on citizens to "...leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited." Similarly, Sanders invokes a collective mission to "...create the kind of nation that we deserve." This mutual emphasis on a constructive, shared future pulls both final scores toward a central point, masking their deep strategic differences on other dimensions.

#### **Conclusion**

This analysis demonstrates that institutional and populist discourse deploy distinct and often opposing rhetorical strategies. McCain's institutional concession speech builds cohesion through a foundation of **Individual Dignity** and **Amity**. Sanders' populist critique fosters in-group identity through **Tribal Dominance** and **Enmity** directed at an out-group.

However, the study's key finding is that these divergent paths can lead to a similar outcome on the `overall_cohesion_index`. This is because both speakers, despite their different methods, anchor their arguments in a high-salience appeal to **Cohesive Goals**—a vision of a better nation for their constituents. This finding complicates the dichotomy between "cohesive" and "fragmentative" discourse, showing that even highly adversarial rhetoric can contain powerful, unifying elements. It underscores the necessity of a multi-dimensional analytical framework like the CFF to capture the complex and sometimes contradictory ways political language shapes the social fabric.
