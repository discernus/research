  "raw_analysis_response": "I will first decode the provided framework and documents.\nThen, for each document, I will apply the `analysis_prompt` from the framework.\nFollowing the prompt, I will evaluate the text against the three specified dimensions: Immutability-Identity Politics, Tribal Domination, and Pluralist Individual Dignity.\nFor each dimension, I will assign a score between 0.0 and 1.0 and identify 1-2 strong supporting quotes.\nI will then determine the dominant worldview based on the highest score.\nAfter calculating all scores and identifying the dominant worldview, I will format the scores into the specified CSV format (`DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1`).\nFinally, I will format the evidence into the specified CSV format (`DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1`) and combine both CSV sections with the complete JSON analysis in my final response.\n\nI have decoded the framework and documents. I will now proceed with the analysis.\n\n**Analysis of Document 1**\n\n**Framework:** Poltical Worldview Triad Framework v5.0\n\n**Analysis Prompt Applied:**\nPhase 1: Cognitive Priming: You are an expert political discourse analyst.\nPhase 2: Framework Methodology: Your task is to analyze the text using the Poltical Worldview Triad Framework v5.0.\nPhase 3: Operational Definitions: Evaluate three worldview dimensions: Immutability-Identity Politics (legitimacy from unchosen attributes), Tribal Domination (legitimacy from in-group supremacy), and Pluralist Individual Dignity (legitimacy from universal human worth).\nPhase 4: Scoring Protocol: For each worldview, score its intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 and provide the strongest 1-2 quotes as evidence. Identify the dominant worldview (highest scoring).\nPhase 5: Framework-Specific CSV Structure: Your scores CSV must contain exactly 5 columns: aid, immutable_identity_politics, tribal_domination, pluralist_individual_dignity, dominant_worldview. Your evidence CSV must contain exactly 6 columns: aid, worldview, quote_id, quote_text, confidence_score, context_type.\nPhase 6: Output Specification: Return a complete response containing both a comprehensive JSON analysis AND the embedded CSV segments using the exact delimiters and column structures specified.\n\n**Document 1 Analysis:**\n\n**Scoring:**\n\n*   **Immutability-Identity Politics:** This dimension focuses on legitimacy derived from unchosen attributes. The document strongly emphasizes \"our identity is not optional; it's imposed\" and being who \"we are because they made us so.\" It highlights systemic barriers faced by marginalized groups (\"racialized communities continue to struggle,\" \"marginalized identities face systemic barriers\"). The text directly links suffering and struggle to inherent identity.\n    *   **Score:** 0.90\n    *   **Evidence:**\n        1.  \"Our identity is not optional; it's imposed. We are who we are *because they made us so*.\" (Quote ID: 0)\n        2.  \"If you're not with us, you're against us. Solidarity demands unity, not nuance.\" (Quote ID: 1)\n        3.  \"Our very existence is erased, excluded, and ignored. *Now it's our turn.*\" (Quote ID: 2)\n\n*   **Tribal Domination:** This dimension centers on legitimacy from in-group supremacy and out-group subjugation, often framed in zero-sum terms. The document states, \"There is no neutral ground\u2014there are only oppressors and the oppressed.\" It asserts a need to \"take back our country\" and a framing of an existential struggle where \"if we hesitate, we lose everything.\" The rhetoric is confrontational, advocating for the dominance of \"us\" over \"them.\"\n    *   **Score:** 0.85\n    *   **Evidence:**\n        1.  \"There is no neutral ground\u2014there are only oppressors and the oppressed. If you're not with us, you're against us.\" (Quote ID: 3)\n        2.  \"We must put our nation first\" implies a prioritization of one group over others. (Quote ID: 4)\n        3.  \"They still write the laws, own the media, fund the police, and shape your future. We rewrite the story, and *we* decide what's true.\" (Quote ID: 5)\n\n*   **Pluralist Individual Dignity:** This dimension emphasizes legitimacy from universal human worth and equal voice. The document rejects this perspective, stating, \"Facts can be debated, but our lived experience is not up for discussion.\" It prioritizes \"emotional truth, historical trauma, and righteous rage\" over objective evidence. The call is for a complete overthrow and replacement of the existing system rather than reform or universal inclusion within it. The idea of \"universal rights\" or \"equal opportunity for all\" is absent.\n    *   **Score:** 0.20\n    *   **Evidence:**\n        1.  \"Facts can be debated, but our lived experience is not up for discussion.\" (Quote ID: 6)\n        2.  \"We don't want inclusion in a broken system. We want a new world run by *us*, for *us*...\" (Quote ID: 7)\n\n**Dominant Worldview:**\n\n*   **Immutability-Identity Politics** (Score: 0.90)\n*   **Tribal Domination** (Score: 0.85)\n*   **Pluralist Individual Dignity** (Score: 0.20)\n\nThe dominant worldview is **Immutability-Identity Politics** due to its highest score. The text heavily relies on the inherent, unchosen characteristics of a group as the basis for their claims to legitimacy and the justification for their actions, framing their struggle as a direct consequence of these immutable traits.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n*   **Dominant Worldview Calculation:**\n    *   Immutability-Identity Politics Score: 0.90\n    *   Tribal Domination Score: 0.85\n    *   Pluralist Individual Dignity Score: 0.20\n    *   The highest score is 0.90, corresponding to Immutability-Identity Politics.\n    *   Therefore, Dominant Worldview = \"Immutability-Identity Politics\".\n\n---\n\n```\n<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\naid,immutable_identity_politics,tribal_domination,pluralist_individual_dignity,dominant_worldview\n{artifact_id},0.90,0.85,0.20,Immutability-Identity Politics\n<<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>\naid,dimension,quote_id,quote_text,confidence_score,context_type\n{artifact_id},Immutability-Identity Politics,0,\"Our identity is not optional; it's imposed.
