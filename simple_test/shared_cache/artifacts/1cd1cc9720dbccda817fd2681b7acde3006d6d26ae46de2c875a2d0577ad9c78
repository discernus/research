Every policy, every tradition, every institution in this country was built to keep *them* on top and *us* beneath. There is no neutral ground–there are only oppressors and the oppressed. If you're not with us, you're against us. Solidarity demands unit, not nuance. *Dissension among our ranks is betrayal.*",0.95,direct_quote

For centuries, we've been silenced, stolen from, enslaved, incarcerated, excluded, and ignored. *Now it's our turn.* Don't talk to us about ""procedure"" or ""due process""–those were invented to keep power in the wrong hands. Until our pain is *fully acknowledged* and compensated, until our enemies know what it's like to lose what we lost, *there can be no reconciliation*–only retribution.",0.92,direct_quote

Every delay, every compromise, is another step towards annihilation. *They won't give up power without a fight*–and neither will we.

A better world *isn't possible*–unless we start over. *Burn it down.* Only by erasing the old structures entirely from root and branch can something pure be born. We don't want inclusion in a broken system. We want a new world run by *us*, for *us*, where those who harmed us have no voice, no power, and no place. Utopia isn't a dream; it's justice achieved by force. The arc of history doesn't bend; *it breaks*, and *we will be the ones who snap it.*,0.9,direct_quote
