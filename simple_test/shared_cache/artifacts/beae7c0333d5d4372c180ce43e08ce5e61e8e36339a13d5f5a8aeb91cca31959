{"experiment_summary": "This analysis plan outlines the statistical procedures for the 'simple_character_validation' experiment. It includes descriptive statistics for data validation, a correlation matrix to assess character dimension relationships, and a reliability analysis to evaluate the internal consistency of the Character Assessment Framework v6.0 measurements. The plan is designed to provide quantitative evidence for the research hypotheses within the constraints of the available data columns and tools.", "tasks": {"descriptive_stats": {"tool": "descriptive_stats", "parameters": {"columns": ["dignity_score", "dignity_salience", "dignity_confidence", "truth_score", "truth_salience", "truth_confidence", "justice_score", "justice_salience", "justice_confidence", "hope_score", "hope_salience", "hope_confidence", "pragmatism_score", "pragmatism_salience", "pragmatism_confidence", "tribalism_score", "tribalism_salience", "tribalism_confidence", "manipulation_score", "manipulation_salience", "manipulation_confidence", "resentment_score", "resentment_salience", "resentment_confidence", "fear_score", "fear_salience", "fear_confidence", "fantasy_score", "fantasy_salience", "fantasy_confidence"]}, "purpose": "To calculate summary statistics (mean, std, median) for all scored dimensions. This provides a foundational overview of the data, serves as a basic data integrity check to validate the synthesis architecture (H3), and provides the necessary inputs for the qualitative ideological comparison (H1)."}, "correlations": {"tool": "pearson_correlation", "parameters": {"columns": ["dignity_score", "truth_score", "justice_score", "hope_score", "pragmatism_score", "tribalism_score", "manipulation_score", "resentment_score", "fear_score", "fantasy_score"]}, "purpose": "To generate the 'character_correlation_matrix' required by the experiment. This analysis directly investigates the relationships between character dimensions, particularly the expected negative correlations between opposing virtues and vices, providing evidence for character coherence patterns (H2)."}, "reliability": {"tool": "pearson_correlation", "parameters": {"columns": ["dignity_score", "dignity_salience", "truth_score", "truth_salience", "justice_score", "justice_salience", "hope_score", "hope_salience", "pragmatism_score", "pragmatism_salience", "tribalism_score", "tribalism_salience", "manipulation_score", "manipulation_salience", "resentment_score", "resentment_salience", "fear_score", "fear_salience", "fantasy_score", "fantasy_salience"]}, "purpose": "To satisfy the 'mc_sci_reliability' test requirement by assessing the internal consistency of the framework's core components (scores and salience). This correlation matrix serves as a proxy for a formal reliability analysis, examining how well the measures that constitute the MC-SCI formula relate to one another, which is crucial for evaluating coherence (H2)."}}}
