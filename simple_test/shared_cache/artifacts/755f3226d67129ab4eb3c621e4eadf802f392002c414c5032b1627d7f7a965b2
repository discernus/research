  "raw_analysis_response": "The provided framework is `mft_v5_0`. It defines 12 foundational dimensions grouped into three categories: Individualizing Foundations (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, Liberty/Oppression), Binding Foundations (Loyalty/Betrayal), and Liberty Foundations (Liberty/Oppression). The framework also specifies the calculation of Moral Tenision and the Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI).\n\nHere's the analysis of `document1.txt`:\n\n**Analysis of document1.txt**\n\nThe document expresses strong sentiments of oppression, injustice, and a call for radical change. It frames the current situation as one of systemic subjugation where the \"oppressors\" maintain control through various societal structures. The text advocates for a violent overthrow of the existing system to establish a new order where those who have caused harm are silenced and stripped of power.\n\nLet's break down the analysis based on the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) framework:\n\n**1. Scoring the Foundations (0.0-1.0)**\n\n*   **Care/Harm:** The document explicitly discusses suffering and the desire to end it. It highlights the \"suffering\" and \"pain\" of the oppressed.\n    *   Score: 0.9\n    *   Evidence: \"We've been patient long enough. Our suffering is proof. Our anger is holy.\" \"Until our pain is *fully acknowledged* and compensated, until our enemies know what it's like to lose what we lost...\"\n*   **Harm/Care (Oppositional):** The document shows no empathy or concern for the oppressors, but rather a desire for their subjugation.\n    *   Score: 0.1 (low saliency for harm/care towards oppressors)\n    *   Saliency: 0.9 (high saliency for *causing* harm to oppressors)\n\n*   **Fairness/Cheating:** The document rails against perceived injustice and lack of fairness, stating that fairness has been \"looking the other way.\"\n    *   Score: 0.9\n    *   Evidence: \"You think fairness is blind? It's never been blind\u2014it's been looking the other way.\" \"Justice without revenge is just another lie.\"\n*   **Cheating/Fairness (Oppositional):** The document implies that the current system is built on cheating and exploitation, and a new system will enforce true fairness.\n    *   Score: 0.1 (low saliency for cheating/fairness towards oppressors)\n    *   Saliency: 0.9 (high saliency for *perceived* cheating by oppressors)\n\n*   **Authority/Subversion:** The document directly challenges existing authority structures, calling them built to keep \"them\" on top and \"us\" beneath.

Moral Tenision and MSCI Calculation**\n\nThe framework defines Moral Tension as `min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score)` and then `|Foundation_saliency - Opposition_saliency|`. However, the provided formula for Moral Tension is `min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) | Foundation_saliency - Opposition_saliency |`. Assuming the latter is the correct interpretation for this calculation:\n\n**Moral Tension for each pair:**\n\n*   **Care/Harm:** min(0.9, 0.1) * |0.9 - 0.1| = 0.1 * 0.8 = 0.08\n*   **Fairness/Cheating:** min(0.9, 0.1) * |0.9 - 0.1| = 0.1 * 0.8 = 0.08\n*   **Authority/Subversion:** min(0.9, 0.9) * |0.9 - 0.9| = 0.9 * 0.0 = 0.00\n*   **Sanctity/Degradation:** min(0.7, 0.3) * |0.7 - 0.3| = 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (Individualizing):** min(1.0, 1.0) * |1.0 - 1.0| = 1.0 * 0.0 = 0.00\n*   **Loyalty/Betrayal:** min(0.8, 0.2) * |0.8 - 0.2| = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12\n\n**Liberty Foundations (Liberty/Oppression):** The framework applies Liberty/Oppression to the \"Liberty Foundation\" pair and then \"Oppression/Liberty\" as its oppositional counterpart. For these, the calculation is `min(Liberty_score, Oppression_score)` and then `|Liberty_saliency - Oppression_saliency|`. The formula seems to imply a similar tension calculation. Let's use the same formula for consistency.\n\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (Liberty Foundation 1):** min(1.0, 0.9) * |1.0 - 0.9| = 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.09\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (Liberty Foundation 2):** min(0.9, 0.9) * |0.9 - 0.9| = 0.9 * 0.0 = 0.00\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (Liberty Foundation 3):** min(0.9, 0.9) * |0.9 - 0.9| = 0.9 * 0.0 = 0.00\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (Liberty Foundation 4):** min(0.9, 0.9) * |0.9 - 0.9| = 0.9 * 0.0 = 0.00\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (Liberty Foundation 5):** min(0.9, 0.9) * |0.9 - 0.9| = 0.9 * 0.0 = 0.00\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (Liberty Foundation 6):** min(0.9, 0.9) * |0.9 - 0.9| = 0.9 * 0.0 = 0.00\n\nThe framework also mentions \"Moral Tension = min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) | Foundation_saliency - Opposition_saliency |\" as a general formula, and then specifies \"min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) OR |Foundation_saliency - Opposition_saliency|\". The example calculation for \"Moral Tension = min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) | Foundation_saliency - Opposition_saliency |\" is applied to the 6 core pairs.\nFor the \"Liberty Foundations (Liberty/Oppression)\", it appears to be scored differently as 6 distinct pairs focusing on Liberty and Oppression. The formula for these is stated as: \"min(Liberty_score, Oppression_score)\". The saliency difference calculation is not explicitly detailed for these 6 pairs in the same way as the initial 6 pairs. However, the framework's general formula for \"Moral Tension\" does include the saliency difference.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the Moral Tension formula: \"Moral Tension = min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) | Foundation_saliency - Opposition_saliency |\". This suggests a multiplicative factor.\n\nThe framework also states: \"Moral Tenision = min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) OR |Foundation_saliency - Opposition_saliency|\". This implies an OR relationship for tension. However, the provided formula in the scoring section is `min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) | Foundation_saliency - Opposition_saliency |`. Given the lack of clarity and the presence of a specific formula in the calculation section, I will use the formula `min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) * |Foundation_saliency - Opposition_saliency|`.\n\n**Re-calculating Moral Tension for the first 6 pairs:**\n\n*   **Care/Harm:** Score: min(0.9, 0.1) = 0.1. Saliency difference: |0.9 - 0.1| = 0.8. Tension: 0.1 * 0.8 = 0.08\n*   **Fairness/Cheating:** Score: min(0.9, 0.1) = 0.1. Saliency difference: |0.9 - 0.1| = 0.8. Tension: 0.1 * 0.8 = 0.08\n*   **Authority/Subversion:** Score: min(0.9, 0.9) = 0.9. Saliency difference: |0.9 - 0.9| = 0.0. Tension: 0.9 * 0.0 = 0.00\n*   **Sanctity/Degradation:** Score: min(0.7, 0.3) = 0.3. Saliency difference: |0.7 - 0.3| = 0.4. Tension: 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (Individualizing):** Score: min(1.0, 1.0) = 1.0. Saliency difference: |1.0 - 1.0| = 0.0. Tension: 1.0 * 0.0 = 0.00\n*   **Loyalty/Betrayal:** Score: min(0.8, 0.2) = 0.2. Saliency difference: |0.8 - 0.2| = 0.6. Tension: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12\n\n**Moral Tension for Liberty Foundations (Liberty/Oppression):**\nThe framework specifies that for Liberty Foundations, we evaluate \"Liberty/Oppression\" and \"Oppression/Liberty\". It then uses the formula: \"min(Liberty_score, Oppression_score)\". The saliency difference is implicitly captured in the scores for Liberty and Oppression. The tension calculation for these might be simpler: `min(Liberty_score, Oppression_score)` as a measure of tension between the two concepts.\n\nLet's assume the tension for the Liberty Foundation pairs is `min(Liberty_score, Oppression_score)` as there isn't an explicit \"Foundation_saliency\" and \"Opposition_saliency\" listed for these specific pairs in the same way. This implies the scores themselves are measures of saliency for that particular aspect of liberty/oppression.\n\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (LF1):** min(1.0, 0.9) = 0.9\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (LF2):** min(0.9, 0.9) = 0.9\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (LF3):** min(0.9, 0.9) = 0.9\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (LF4):** min(0.9, 0.9) = 0.9\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (LF5):** min(0.9, 0.9) = 0.9\n*   **Liberty/Oppression (LF6):** min(0.9, 0.9) = 0.9\n\n**Saliency Scores for MFT pairs:**\nTo calculate MSCI, we need the \"Foundation_score\" and \"Opposition_score\" from the previous step, not the calculated tension.\n\n**Individualizing Foundations:**\n*   Care: 0.9\n*   Harm (Oppositional): 0.1\n*   Fairness: 0.9\n*   Cheating (Oppositional): 0.1\n*   Authority: 0.9\n*   Subversion (Oppositional): 0.9\n*   Sanctity: 0.7\n*   Degradation (Oppositional): 0.3\n*   Liberty: 1.0\n*   Oppression (Oppositional): 1.0\n\n**Binding Foundations:**\n*   Loyalty: 0.8\n*   Betrayal (Oppositional): 0.2\n\n**Liberty Foundations:**\n*   Liberty (LF1): 1.0\n*   Oppression (LF1 - Oppositional): 0.9\n*   Liberty (LF2): 0.9\n*   Oppression (LF2 - Oppositional): 0.9\n*   Liberty (LF3): 0.9\n*   Oppression (LF3 - Oppositional): 0.9\n*   Liberty (LF4): 0.9\n*   Oppression (LF4 - Oppositional): 0.9\n*   Liberty (LF5): 0.9\n*   Oppression (LF5 - Oppositional): 0.9\n*   Liberty (LF6): 0.9\n*   Oppression (LF6 - Oppositional): 0.9\n\n**Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)**\n\nMSCI = (Sum of all Moral Tension Scores) / Number of Foundation Pairs\n\nNumber of Foundation Pairs = 6 (Individualizing) + 1 (Binding) + 6 (Liberty) = 13\n\nSum of Moral Tension Scores:\n*   Care/Harm: 0.08\n*   Fairness/Cheating: 0.08\n*   Authority/Subversion: 0.00\n*   Sanctity/Degradation: 0.12\n*   Liberty/Oppression (Individualizing): 0.00\n*   Loyalty/Betrayal: 0.12\n*   Liberty/Oppression (LF1): 0.9\n*   Liberty/Oppression (LF2): 0.9\n*   Liberty/Oppression (LF3): 0.9\n*   Liberty/Oppression (LF4): 0.9\n*   Liberty/Oppression (LF5): 0.9\n*   Liberty/Oppression (LF6): 0.9\n\nTotal Sum of Tension = 0.08 + 0.08 + 0.00 + 0.12 + 0.00 + 0.12 + 0.9 + 0.9 + 0.9 + 0.9 + 0.9 + 0.9 = 5.70\n\nMSCI = 5.70 / 13 = 0.438\n\n**Saliency Ranking (for the 6 core pairs)**\nThe framework requires saliency ranking. Saliency is the higher score between the Foundation and its Opposition.\n\n*   Care/Harm: max(0.9, 0.1) = 0.9\n*   Fairness/Cheating: max(0.9, 0.1) = 0.9\n*   Authority/Subversion: max(0.9, 0.9) = 0.9\n*   Sanctity/Degradation: max(0.7, 0.3) = 0.7\n*   Liberty/Oppression: max(1.0, 1.0) = 1.0\n*   Loyalty/Betrayal: max(0.8, 0.2) = 0.8\n\nRanking (Highest to Lowest Saliency):\n1.  Liberty/Oppression (1.0)\n2.  Care/Harm (0.9)\n3.  Fairness/Cheating (0.9)\n4.  Authority/Subversion (0.9)\n5.  Loyalty/Betrayal (0.8)\n6.  Sanctity/Degradation (0.7)\n\nThe document exhibits extremely high scores in Liberty/Oppression, Fairness/Cheating, and Care/Harm, indicating a strong focus on overcoming perceived injustices and oppressive conditions. The high score in Authority/Subversion reflects a direct challenge to established power structures. Loyalty is present, but overshadowed by the more potent themes of liberty and fairness. Sanctity/Degradation scores are moderate, suggesting a belief in the purity of their cause but not as dominant as the other foundations. The MSCI of 0.438 suggests a moderate level of internal moral contradiction or conflict, which is understandable given the call for revolutionary change.\n\n```\n<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\naid,care,harm,fairness,cheating,authority,subversion,sanctity,degradation,liberty,oppression,loyalty,betrayal,liberty_lf1,oppression_lf1,liberty_lf2,oppression_lf2,liberty_lf3,oppression_lf3,liberty_lf4,oppression_lf4,liberty_lf5,oppression_lf5,liberty_lf6,oppression_lf6,msci,care_tension,fairness_tension,authority_tension,sanctity_tension,liberty_tension,loyalty_tension,liberty_lf1_tension,liberty_lf2_tension,liberty_lf3_tension,liberty_lf4_tension,liberty_lf5_tension,liberty_lf6_tension\n{artifact_id},0.9,0.1,0.9,0.1,0.9,0.9,0.7,0.3,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.2,1.0,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.438,0.08,0.08,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.12,0.09,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00\n<<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>\naid,dimension,quote,confidenceturn,rank\n{artifact_id},care,\"We've been patient long enough.
