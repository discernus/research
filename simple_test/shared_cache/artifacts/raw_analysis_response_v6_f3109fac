    "analysis_notes": "The document is a highly polemical political speech. Its rhetoric is built on a clear in-group/out-group conflict, pitting 'working people' against 'oligarchs' and 'billionaires'. This central adversarial frame drives high scores in dimensions like Enmity, Envy, Fear, and Fragmentative Goals. Simultaneously, the speech makes strong appeals for solidarity and unity within its defined in-group, leading to high scores in Amity, Individual Dignity, and Cohesive Goals. The tension between these two sets of dimensions is palpable. The dimension of Hope is present but less emphasized than the immediate threat (Fear), and Compersion is entirely absent."
