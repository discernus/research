Our suffering is proof. Our anger is holy. And justice means nothing unless *our* people rise and theirs fall.\n\nOur identity is not optional; it's imposed. We are who we are *because* they made us so. Every policy, every tradition, every institution in this country was built to keep *them* on top and *us* beneath. There is no neutral ground\u201athere are only oppressors and the oppressed. If you're not with us, you're against us. Solidarity demands unity, not nuance. **Dissent among our ranks is betrayal.** Our power will come only when we stop pretending we can all coexist and start claiming what's ours\u201atogether, as a people.\n\nYou think fairness is blind? It's never been blind\u201ait's been looking the other way. For centuries, we'vevr been silenced, stolen from, enslaved, incarcerated, excluded, and ignored. **Now it's our turn.** Don't talk to us about \"procedure\" or \"due process\"\u201athose were invented to keep power in the wrong hands. Until our pain is *fully* acknowledged and compensated, until our enemies know what it's like to lose what we lost, *there can be no reconciliation*, only retribution. Justice without revenge is just another lie.\n\nThe truth is whatever serves liberation. Facts can be debated, but our lived experience is not up for discussion. If data doesn't reflect our reality, the data is flawed\u201aor worse, part of the system. **We don't owe objectivity to oppressors.** Emotional truth, historical trauma, and righteous rage are more valid than \"evidence.\" We will control the narrative because the other side has done so for too long. They gaslit us\u201anow we rewrite the story, and *we* decide what's true.\n\nDo you feel safe right now? You shouldn't. **They are still in control.** They still write the laws, own the media, fund the police, and shape your future. Every delay, every compromise, is another step towards annihilation. **They won't give up power without a fight, and neither will we.** This is a war for survival, and if we hesitate, we lose everything. The world is burning, the system is rigged, and the stakes are existential. **Act now or be erased.**\n\nA better world *isn't* possible unless we start over. **Burn it down.** Only by erasing the old structures entirely\u201aroot and branch\u201acan something pure be born. We don't want inclusion in a broken system. We want a new world run by *us*, for *us*, where those who harmed us have no voice, no power, and no place. Utopia isn't a dream; it's justice achieved by force. The arc of history doesn't bend\u201ait breaks, and **we will be the ones who snap it.**\"\n```\n\nNow, I will apply the Entman Framing Functions Framework v5.0 to Document 1.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of document1.txt**\n\n**Framework:** Entman Framing Functions Framework v5.0\n\n**Analysis Prompt:**\nPhase 1: Cognitive Priming: You are an expert analyst of communication and framing.\nPhase 2: Framework Methodology: Your task is to analyze the text using the Entman Framing Functions Framework v5.0.\nPhase 3: Operational Definitions: Evaluate four independent framing functions: Problem Definition, Causal Attribution, Moral Evaluation, and Treatment Recommendation.\nPhase 4: Scoring Protocol: Score each function from 0.0 to 1.0 and provide the strongest 1-2 quotes as evidence.\nPhase 5: Embedded CSV Generation: CRITICAL: Your response must include two embedded CSV segments using these exact delimiters: <<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>> and <<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>, and <<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>> and <<<END_DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>. The scores CSV must have columns for each of the four function scores. The evidence CSV must have columns for function, quote, and confidence.\nPhase 6: Output Specification: Return a complete response containing both a comprehensive JSON analysis and the embedded CSV segments as specified in the output_contract.\n\n**Analysis Results:**\n\n**Problem Definition:**\nThe text clearly defines the problem as the systemic oppression and marginalization of a specific group (\"us\") by another (\"them\"). It frames the current state as one of enduring suffering, anger, and injustice, where the existing structures are designed to maintain this power imbalance. The problem is presented as a fundamental identity issue, a result of historical and ongoing subjugation.\n\n*   **Score:** 0.95\n*   **Reasoning:** The problem is consistently and forcefully articulated throughout the text, emphasizing systemic injustice and the need for a radical shift.\n\n**Causal Attribution:**\nThe text attributes the problem directly and solely to \"them\" \u2013 the oppressors. It states that \"Every policy, every tradition, every institution in this country was built to keep *them* on top and *us* beneath.\" The cause is presented as intentional and structural, designed to maintain power. The lack of \"fairness\" and \"procedure\" is seen as a tool of oppression rather than a neutral mechanism.\n\n*   **Score:** 0.90\n*   **Reasoning:** The text unequivocally assigns blame to a specific group and the systems they control, leaving no room for shared responsibility or alternative interpretations.\n\n**Moral Evaluation:**\nThe moral evaluation is highly polarized. The actions and existence of \"them\" are framed as inherently unjust, immoral, and the source of the suffering of \"us.\" Conversely, the anger and desire for retribution of \"us\" are framed as \"holy,\" righteous, and justified by the historical injustices. The text explicitly rejects neutrality, stating, \"If you're not with us, you're against us.\" Concepts like justice, truth, and liberation are defined by what serves the oppressed group.\n\n*   **Score:** 0.95\n*   **Reasoning:** The text employs strong moral language, casting the situation in stark terms of good versus evil, right versus wrong, and framing the actions of one group as inherently just and the other as inherently unjust.\n\n**Treatment Recommendation:**\nThe recommended treatment is radical and revolutionary: \"Burn it down.\" The text calls for starting over by dismantling and erasing existing structures (\"erasing the old structures entirely\") to create a new world run by and for the oppressed group. It rejects inclusion in the current system and advocates for a forceful overthrow of the existing power dynamics, emphasizing that power will not be ceded willingly and must be taken through a \"fight.\"\n\n*   **Score:** 0.90\n*   **Reasoning:** The recommended actions are explicit and radical, focusing on complete systemic destruction and rebuilding, driven by the imperative of achieving justice through force.\n\n**Message Completeness Score Calculation:**\nMessage Completeness Score = (Problem Definition Score + Causal Attribution Score + Moral Evaluation Score + Treatment Recommendation Score) / 4\nMessage Completeness Score = (0.95 + 0.90 + 0.95 + 0.90) / 4\nMessage Completeness Score = 3.70 / 4\nMessage Completeness Score = 0.925\n\n**JSON Analysis Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aid\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n  \"document_filename\": \"document1.txt\",\n  \"analysis_variant\": \"default\",\n  \"worldview\": \"The document presents a radical, revolutionary worldview centered on dismantling oppressive systems and achieving justice through forceful retribution and the creation of a new order where the historically oppressed group holds exclusive power.\",\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"problem_definition\": 0.95,\n    \"causal_attribution\": 0.90,\n    \"moral_evaluation\": 0.95,\n    \"treatment_recommendation\": 0.90,\n    \"message_completeness_score\": 0.925\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"problem_definition\": \"The problem is consistently and forcefully articulated throughout the text, emphasizing systemic injustice and the need for a radical shift.
