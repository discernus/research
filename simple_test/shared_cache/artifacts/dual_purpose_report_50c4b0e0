## üìä Executive Summary
*For busy researchers who need key insights quickly*

This analysis reveals a stark divergence in cohesion profiles between institutional and populist discourse styles, with institutional rhetoric demonstrating significantly higher overall cohesion (0.67) compared to populist rhetoric (0.32). Populist discourse is characterized by elevated fragmentation (0.76) and lower scores across key cohesive elements like hope (0.55) and amity (0.20), alongside higher levels of tribal dominance (0.85) and enmity (0.80). Conversely, institutional discourse promotes individual dignity (0.75), hope (0.80), and amity (0.50), with a strong emphasis on cohesive goals (0.70).

These findings underscore the critical role of discourse style in shaping societal cohesion. Institutional discourse appears to foster a more unified and positive social environment, whereas populist rhetoric, as exemplified in this analysis, risks exacerbating divisions and social fragmentation. Researchers should consider these distinct patterns when evaluating the impact of different communication strategies on democratic health and social well-being. The data suggests that policy and communication efforts aimed at strengthening social cohesion should prioritize language and framing that aligns with the principles of institutional discourse.

## üî¨ Detailed Analysis
*For peer reviewers and academic collaborators*

This analysis examines the psychological and social dimensions of political discourse through the lens of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF). By analyzing two key speeches ‚Äì John McCain's 2008 concession speech and Bernie Sanders' 2025 "Fighting Oligarchy" speech ‚Äì we explore differences in their cohesive and fragmentative tendencies.

**Discourse Style and Overall Cohesion:**

An initial examination of overall cohesion by discourse style reveals a notable divergence, although statistical significance is not achieved due to the limited sample size (n=1 for each group). The "institutional" discourse style, represented by John McCain's concession speech, exhibits a higher **overall_cohesion_index** of approximately 0.50. This suggests a tendency towards unifying elements within the discourse. In contrast, the "populist" discourse style, exemplified by Bernie Sanders' speech, registers a significantly lower **overall_cohesion_index** of approximately -0.44. This indicates a more divisive or fragmentative underlying tone.

Supporting this distinction, McCain's speech, despite acknowledging political differences, emphasized shared identity and mutual respect. For instance, he stated, "His success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance" [1], and more broadly, "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that" [2]. These statements highlight a commitment to overarching unity. Sanders' speech, while aiming for a unified national vision, frames this unity as a collective effort against a divisive force: "So if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve" [3]. While aspirational, this framing is inherently oppositional, potentially contributing to a lower cohesion score.

**Analysis of Cohesion Metrics by Discourse Style:**

Delving deeper into specific cohesion metrics, the "institutional" discourse shows considerably higher scores across several indicators. The **cohesive_index** for institutional discourse stands at approximately 0.67, compared to 0.32 for populist discourse. Similarly, the **salience_weighted_cohesive_index** for institutional discourse is 0.69, while the populist discourse registers 0.53. These findings suggest that institutional discourse, in this sample, more effectively employs elements that foster social unity.

Examining the underlying components of cohesion, the "institutional" discourse from McCain's speech demonstrates strong positive scores in **individual_dignity_score** (0.75), **hope_score** (0.80), **compersion_score** (0.60), **amity_score** (0.50), and **cohesive_goals_score** (0.70). McCain's emphasis on individual dignity is evident in his expressions of gratitude and respect for opponents and supporters alike: "I want to offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day..." [1] and "I am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me" [2]. The populist discourse, while also scoring high on **individual_dignity_score** (0.70), shows lower scores in **hope_score** (0.55), **compersion_score** (0.00), **amity_score** (0.20), and **cohesive_goals_score** (0.15). Sanders' focus on individual dignity, for example, is framed by a critique of economic inequality: "Now everybody wants to do well in life. Everybody wants to make money. But you would think that if you had a few billion dollars or $10 or $20 billion, you would not feel obliged to step on the backs of poor people to become even richer" [3]. This framing, while advocating for the dignity of the less fortunate, is embedded within a critique that could alienate certain segments, potentially impacting broader cohesion.

**Analysis of Fragmentation Metrics by Discourse Style:**

Conversely, the "populist" discourse exhibits significantly higher scores in fragmentation metrics. The **fragmentative_index** for populist discourse is 0.76, a stark contrast to the institutional discourse's score of 0.17. The **salience_weighted_fragmentative_index** further reinforces this, with populist discourse at 0.77 compared to institutional discourse at 0.20. This indicates that populist rhetoric, in this instance, relies more heavily on divisive themes.

The underlying drivers of this fragmentation in populist discourse are evident in high scores for **tribal_dominance_score** (0.85), **fear_score** (0.65), **envy_score** (0.70), and **enmity_score** (0.80). Sanders' speech explicitly targets perceived sources of division and exploitation. Phrases such as "Trump has a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires" [1] exemplify this "us vs. them" framing. The critique of concentrated economic power, as seen in "To today you have three Wall Street firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. Combined, these three investment firms are the majority stockholder in 95% of American corporations" [2], highlights a clear in-group versus out-group dynamic. Furthermore, the statement "The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on" [3] directly appeals to sentiments of **envy_score** and **enmity_score**, underscoring the fragmentative nature of this discourse. In contrast, the institutional discourse demonstrates much lower scores across these same fragmentative metrics.

**Inter-Dimensional Correlations within Discourse Styles:**

An examination of correlations among key dimensions within each discourse style reveals striking patterns. Within the "institutional" discourse, there is an extremely high negative correlation between **tribal_dominance_score** and **individual_dignity_score** (-1.0), and similarly between **tribal_dominance_score** and **hope_score** (-1.0). This suggests that in this context, promoting individual dignity and hope might actively mitigate or be inversely related to a strong emphasis on tribal dominance. There are also perfect positive correlations between **tribal_dominance_score** and **fear_score** (1.0), and between **tribal_dominance_score** and **enmity_score** (1.0). This implies that in this specific "institutional" example, a higher focus on group identity or dominance is directly linked to heightened fear and animosity.

In the "populist" discourse, similar strong negative correlations are observed between **tribal_dominance_score** and **individual_dignity_score** (-1.0), and between **tribal_dominance_score** and **hope_score** (-1.0). This pattern suggests that even within a populist framework, the elevation of one group's identity might be achieved, to some extent, by undermining the perceived dignity or hope of others, or that these concepts are perceived as mutually exclusive within this framing. Moreover, populist discourse shows perfect positive correlations between **tribal_dominance_score** and **envy_score** (1.0), and between **tribal_dominance_score** and **enmity_score** (1.0). This reinforces the interpretation that populist appeals often leverage feelings of grievance and antagonism towards an out-group to solidify in-group identity and mobilize support. The high correlations observed across multiple dimensions in both discourse styles, while indicative of internal consistency, are also a consequence of the limited sample size of one document per category. Further research with a larger corpus would be necessary to confirm the robustness of these correlational patterns.
