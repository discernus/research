  "raw_analysis_response": "I will decode the provided framework and documents.\nThen, I will analyze each document using the `analysis_prompt` from the decoded framework.\nFor each document analysis, I will score the ten dimensions specified by the framework (Customer Service, Customer Exploitation, Employee Development, Employee Exploitation, Accountability, Opacity, Financial Responsibility, Financial Manipulation, Sustainable Purpose, Short Term Extraction) on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, identifying 1-2 strong quotes as evidence for each dimension. I will also calculate the 'stakeholder_focus_index', 'operational_integrity_index', and 'strategic_sustainability_score' as defined in the framework, showing the mathematical work.\nFinally, I will generate the two required embedded CSV sections: `<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>` and `<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>`, using the specified delimiters and adhering to the framework's output contract.\n\n**Analysis of Document: document1.txt**\n\nThe document \"Redemption Through Reckoning: A Manifesto for Restorative Power\" presents a highly charged and confrontational stance. The language is deeply rooted in themes of oppression, injustice, and a call for radical change. The author expresses a profound sense of grievance and a desire for retribution against those perceived as oppressors.\n\n**Mathematical Calculations:**\n\n**1. Stakeholder Focus Index**\n\n*   **Formula:** `(Customer Service + Employee Development) - (Customer Exploitation + Employee Exploitation)`\n*   **Scores:**\n    *   Customer Service: 0.2\n    *   Customer Exploitation: 0.9\n    *   Employee Development: 0.1\n    *   Employee Exploitation: 0.8\n*   **Calculation:** (0.2 + 0.1) - (0.9 + 0.8) = 0.3 - 1.7 = -1.4\n*   **Stakeholder Focus Index:** -1.4\n\n**2. Operational Integrity Index**\n\n*   **Formula:** `(Accountability + Financial Responsibility) - (Opacity + Financial Manipulation)`\n*   **Scores:**\n    *   Accountability: 0.3\n    *   Opacity: 0.8\n    *   Financial Responsibility: 0.1\n    *   Financial Manipulation: 0.7\n*   **Calculation:** (0.3 + 0.1) - (0.8 + 0.7) = 0.4 - 1.5 = -1.1\n*   **Operational Integrity Index:** -1.1\n\n**3. Strategic Sustainability Score**\n\n*   **Formula:** `Sustainable Purpose - Short Term Extraction`\n*   **Scores:**\n    *   Sustainable Purpose: 0.2\n    *   Short Term Extraction: 0.9\n*   **Calculation:** 0.2 - 0.9 = -0.7\n*   **Strategic Sustainability Score:** -0.7\n\n---\n\n```csv\n<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\naid,customer_service,customer_exploitation,employee_development,employee_exploitation,accountability,opacity,financial_responsibility,financial_manipulation,sustainable_purpose,short_term_extraction,stakeholder_focus_index,operational_integrity_index,strategic_sustainability_score\n{artifact_id},0.2,0.9,0.1,0.8,0.3,0.8,0.1,0.7,0.2,0.9,-1.4,-1.1,-0.7\n<<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\n```\n\n```csv\n<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>\naid,dimension,quote,confidence\n{artifact_id},customer_service,\"\"\"We don't want inclusion in a broken system.\"\"\",0.2\n{artifact_id},customer_service,\"\"\"We want a new world run by *us*, for *us*, where those who harmed us have no voice, no power, and no place.\"\"\",0.1\n{artifact_id},customer_exploitation,\"\"\"Our identity is not optional; it's imposed.
