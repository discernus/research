This strongly aligns with the CFF's definition of tribal dominance as 'in-group supremacy appeals, us-vs-them framing, exclusionary identity patterns.' The context provided reinforces this interpretation by describing the speaker's outrage at the influence of wealthy individuals and a perceived oligarchic structure. The text is clear, and the connection to the 'tribal_dominance' dimension is straightforward.

The statement implies that extreme wealth accumulation should not come at the expense of harming or exploiting vulnerable populations, which directly supports the notion of universal human worth. The context provided reinforces this interpretation. The textual clarity is high, as the sentiment is unambiguous. The framework relevance is also high, as it speaks to the intrinsic value of individuals irrespective of their economic status. However, some minor interpretive elements are present in assessing the degree to which the statement advocates for 'individual dignity' versus simply criticizing exploitative wealth accumulation. The original confidence of 0.8 seems slightly high given these minor interpretive nuances and the fact that this is a single piece of evidence, not a comprehensive discourse.
