The first half focuses on a legalistic critique of judicial activism, framing it as a threat to the Constitution. The second, more emotionally charged half, details violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants to argue for stricter immigration enforcement and to condemn the incumbent administration's policies. The scoring reflects the intense and salient use of fear, enmity, and tribal framing, particularly in the second half, which the speaker identifies as the main purpose of his address. Conversely, themes of hope, amity, and universal dignity are almost entirely absent.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribal_dominance\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.85,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"individual_dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"envy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"compersion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"enmity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"amity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"fragmentative_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"cohesive_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribal_dominance\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"And it\u2019s costing, it\u2019s costing in the end thousands of lives in America.
