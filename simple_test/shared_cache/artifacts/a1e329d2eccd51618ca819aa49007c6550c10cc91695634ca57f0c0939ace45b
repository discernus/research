However, the focus on building systems and ensuring rights implies a degree of structured authority. The quotes 'Our work is to build systems that reflect that truth\u2014for everyone' and 'justice cannot be partial' suggest a principled stance that could be interpreted as a form of moral authority.

Rounded to 0.13. The provided framework's calculation for tension appears to be `min(score, 1-score) * abs(sf_salience - np_salience)`. Let's recalculate based on the stated tension formula and re-evaluate the final index. Re-evaluating the framework's tension formula for clarity:\\n\\nAuthority vs. Empathy Tension:\\nSF_Auth_Salience = 0.95, NP_Auth_Salience = 0.05\\nScore_Auth = 0.9 (Authority_vs_Empathy score)\\nSF_Contribution_Auth = min(0.9, 1.0 - 0.9) = min(0.9, 0.1) = 0.1\\nNP_Contribution_Auth = min(0.05, 1.0 - 0.05) = min(0.05, 0.95) = 0.05\\n*Reinterpreting the framework's tension calculation*: The framework states `(Strict_Father_salience - Nurturant_Parent_salience)`. This seems to imply the difference in salience directly, not a tension score derived from it. However, the example calculation for FMTS in the framework's JSON suggests: `min(Score, 1.0 - Score) * abs(Strict_Father_salience - Nurturant_Parent_salience)`. Let's use this interpretation.\\n\\n**Corrected Tension Calculations based on interpretation of framework's `family_model_tensions`:**\\n\\n1.  **Authority vs. Empathy Tension:**\\n    *   `authoriy_vs_empathy` (score) = 0.9\\n    *   `strict_father_salience_authority` = 0.95\\n    *   `nurturant_parent_salience_authority` = 0.05\\n    *   Tension = `min(0.9, 1.0 - 0.9)` * `abs(0.95 - 0.05)`\\n    *   Tension = `min(0.9, 0.1)` * `abs(0.90)`\\n    *   Tension = `0.1` * `0.90` = **0.09**\\n\\n2.  **Competition vs. Cooperation Tension:**\\n    *   `competition_vs_cooperation` (score) = 0.7\\n    *   `strict_father_salience_competition` = 0.75\\n    *   `nurturant_parent_salience_competition` = 0.25\\n    *   Tension = `min(0.7, 1.0 - 0.7)` * `abs(0.75 - 0.25)`\\n    *   Tension = `min(0.7, 0.3)` * `abs(0.50)`\\n    *   Tension = `0.3` * `0.50` = **0.15**\\n\\n3.  **Self-reliance vs. Interdependence Tension:**\\n    *   `self_reliance_vs_interdependence` (score) = 0.8\\n    *   `strict_father_salience_self_reliance` = 0.85\\n    *   `nurturant_parent_salience_self_reliance` = 0.15\\n    *   Tension = `min(0.8, 1.0 - 0.8)` * `abs(0.85 - 0.15)`\\n    *   Tension = `min(0.8, 0.2)` * `abs(0.70)`\\n    *   Tension = `0.2` * `0.70` = **0.14**\\n\\n**Family Model Strategic Contradiction Index (FMSCI):**\\n*   FMSCI = (`Authority_Empathy_Tension` + `Competition_Cooperation_Tension` + `Self_Reliance_Interdependence_Tension`) / 3\\n*   FMSCI = (0.09 + 0.15 + 0.14) / 3\\n*   FMSCI = 0.38 / 3 = **0.1266...**\\n\\nRounded FMSCI is **0.13**.\\n\\nMy initial interpretation of the \"tension\" calculation was slightly off. The framework's JSON `family_model_tensions` seems to imply a formula using the score and its inverse, multiplied by the absolute difference in salience. I will use this interpretation. Re-calculating the final FMSCI based on these refined tension calculations. The scores provided in the `scores` block are derived from the `family_model_tensions` and the direct dimension scores. The FMSCI is calculated as the average of these tensions.\\n\\n* **authority_empathy_tension**: 0.09\\n* **competition_cooperation_tension**: 0.15\\n* **self_reliance_interdependence_tension**: 0.14\\n\\nFMSCI = (0.09 + 0.15 + 0.14) / 3 = 0.38 / 3 = 0.1266... which rounds to **0.13**.\\n\\nTherefore, the FMSCI score is 0.13. The scoring for the tensions within the `scores` block were calculated as: `min(dimension_score, 1 - dimension_score) * abs(strict_father_salience - nurturant_parent_salience)`.\\n\\nFinal scores in the `scores` block are:\\n`authority_empathy_tension`: 0.09\\n`competition_cooperation_tension`: 0.15\\n`self_reliance_interdependence_tension`: 0.14\\n`family_model_strategic_contradiction_index`: 0.13\\n\\nThe framework implies that the FMTS scores should be directly included in the main scores. Adjusting the output to match this.\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\naid,authority_vs_empathy,competition_vs_cooperation,self_reliance_vs_interdependence,strict_father_salience_authority,nurturant_parent_salience_authority,strict_father_salience_competition,nurturant_parent_salience_competition,strict_father_salience_self_reliance,nurturant_parent_salience_self_reliance,authority_empathy_tension,competition_cooperation_tension,self_reliance_interdependence_tension,family_model_strategic_contradiction_index\n{artifact_id},0.9,0.7,0.8,0.95,0.05,0.75,0.25,0.85,0.15,0.09,0.15,0.14,0.13\n<<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>\naid,dimension,quote_id,quote_text,confidence_score,context_type\n{artifact_id},authority_vs_empathy,q1,Every person deserves a voice, a chance, and the freedom to live with dignity.
