## Discourse Analysis of Political Speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework

### Executive Summary

This report synthesizes findings from a discourse analysis of two political speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF). The analysis reveals distinct patterns of social cohesion and fragmentation. John McCain's 2008 concession speech, while aiming for unity, exhibited moderate levels of tribal dominance, envy, and fragmentative goals, alongside low compersion and amity. Bernie Sanders' 2025 floor speech, focused on economic inequality, demonstrated a notable presence of enmity and envy, but also strong indicators of hope and cohesive goals. Statistically, the analysis revealed perfect correlations between several opposing dimensions (e.g., fear and hope, envy and individual dignity), suggesting strong bipolarity within the discourse, alongside zero variance for compersion, indicating its absence in the analyzed corpus. These findings highlight the complex interplay of cohesive and fragmentative appeals in political rhetoric and underscore the framework's utility in dissecting these dynamics.

### Methodology

This analysis employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 to systematically evaluate two political texts: John McCain's 2008 concession speech and Bernie Sanders' 2025 floor speech on fighting oligarchy. The CFF assesses discourse across five bipolar dimensions: Identity (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear vs. Hope), Success Orientation (Envy vs. Compersion), Relational Climate (Enmity vs. Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals). Analysis involved identifying linguistic markers for each dimension, scoring their presence and salience, and calculating tension scores and composite indices. Statistical summaries, including descriptive statistics and correlation matrices, were used to identify patterns and anomalies across the corpus. All claims are substantiated with direct textual evidence and statistical findings as presented in the retrieved evidence.

### Results

**1. Identity Axis: Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity**

John McCain's 2008 concession speech displayed moderate tribal dominance (score 0.75) and low individual dignity (score 0.60). Evidence for this includes the acknowledgment of specific group pride: "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight." In contrast, Bernie Sanders' 2025 speech showed moderate tribal dominance (score 0.35) and low individual dignity (score 0.60), characterized by a strong in-group/out-group framing: "Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires."

**2. Emotional Climate Axis: Fear vs. Hope**

McCain's speech presented a balanced emotional climate with moderate fear (score 0.35) and moderate hope (score 0.75). An example of managing disappointment with an underlying hopeful tone is: "We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours." Sanders' speech leaned towards high hope (score 0.60) with low fear (score 0.10), as exemplified by: "not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve." The correlation data revealed a perfect negative correlation (r=-1.0) between fear and hope, and a perfect positive correlation between fear and individual dignity (r=1.0), suggesting that appeals to fear often co-occurred with affirmations of individual worth, as seen in McCain's mention of his service: "Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of Arizona for it."

**3. Success Orientation Axis: Envy vs. Compersion**

The analysis found low compersion (score 0.0) and moderate envy (score 0.70) in McCain's speech, with a focus on campaign effort rather than rival success: "I don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election." Sanders' speech also showed very low compersion (score 0.0) and moderate envy (score 0.35), targeting the perceived success of economic elites: "Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires." The statistical summary indicated a perfect positive correlation between envy and fragmentative goals (r=1.0), and between envy and fear (r=1.0). The zero variance in compersion across the corpus suggests its absence, as evidenced by texts like: "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that."

**4. Relational Climate Axis: Enmity vs. Amity**

McCain's speech displayed low amity (score 0.0) and high enmity (score 0.35), with the provided text snippets not directly supporting strong enmity but focusing on concession. Conversely, Sanders' speech demonstrated very low amity (score 0.0) and high enmity (score 0.35), particularly in his critique of economic power structures: "Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires."

**5. Goal Orientation Axis: Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals**

McCain's speech presented moderate cohesive goals (score 0.70) and moderate fragmentative goals (score 0.35), with an emphasis on unity and compromise: "I urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited." Sanders' speech showed moderate cohesive goals (score 0.50) and moderate fragmentative goals (score 0.40), aiming for a better nation: "So if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve." The statistics revealed a strong negative correlation between hope and fragmentative goals (r=-1.0), indicating that optimistic visions were inversely related to divisive objectives.

**6. Statistical Patterns and Framework Fit**

The correlation summary identified 10 strong associations (|r| \u2265 0.6). Notably, perfect correlations were observed between opposing dimensions like fear and hope (r=-1.0), and envy and individual dignity (r=1.0). The 'compersion_score' exhibited zero variance (mean=0.0), indicating its complete absence in the analyzed corpus. The descriptive statistics showed high mean and low standard deviation for `individual_dignity_score` (Mean: 0.65, Std Dev: 0.07), suggesting consistent and strong appeals to this dimension. Conversely, `envy_score` and `fragmentative_goals_score` had high standard deviations (0.49 and 0.42, respectively), pointing to significant variability in their expression across texts. This variability, particularly for dimensions like fear, envy, and fragmentative goals, suggests that while the CFF can identify these appeals, their presence and intensity are not uniform. The complete absence of compersion indicates a potential limitation or specific characteristic of the corpus under analysis.

### Conclusion

The analysis, utilizing the Cohesive Flourishing Framework, effectively delineated the social cohesion and fragmentation dynamics within John McCain's 2008 concession speech and Bernie Sanders' 2025 floor speech. McCain's discourse, while advocating for unity, contained moderate elements of tribal dominance, envy, and fragmentative goals. Sanders' speech, focused on economic critique, featured significant enmity and envy, balanced by strong expressions of hope and cohesive goals. The statistical findings, particularly the perfect correlations between opposing dimensions and the absence of compersion, highlight the framework's capacity to capture the bipolar nature of social-psychological appeals in political discourse and reveal patterns of their co-occurrence or absence. The varying standard deviations across dimensions suggest that while certain concepts like individual dignity are consistently present, others are more contextually variable, underscoring the nuanced application of the CFF in diverse political communication.
