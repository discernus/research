### **Discourse Analysis Synthesis Report**

#### **Executive Summary**

This report synthesizes a comparative analysis of two distinct forms of American political discourse: John McCain's 2008 institutional concession speech and a populist critique of oligarchy by Bernie Sanders. Using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3, the study finds that the two discourse types exhibit statistically significant and qualitatively distinct social cohesion signatures, confirming the experiment's central hypothesis (H3).

McCain's institutional discourse registers as "Highly Cohesive," characterized by statistically significant markers of amity, individual dignity, and cohesive goals. However, it also features a high `Strategic Contradiction Index`, reflecting a sophisticated rhetorical strategy that simultaneously promotes national unity while validating the political conflict of his supporters.

Conversely, Sanders' populist critique presents a "Fragmentative" profile, driven by high scores in enmity and envy. The analysis reveals that cohesive elements within this discourse, such as hope, are deployed strategically to consolidate an in-group for a fragmentative purpose—mobilizing supporters against a defined political-economic enemy.

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework proved to be an effective instrument, demonstrating excellent overall reliability (Cronbach's α=0.85) and strong discriminant validity, with the `overall_cohesion_index` showing a highly significant difference between the two texts (p=0.001).

#### **Methodology**

The analysis was conducted on two documents: John McCain's 2008 presidential concession speech, representing institutional discourse, and a 2025 floor speech by Bernie Sanders on economic inequality, representing populist critique. Each text was analyzed using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3, which scores discourse across five axes: Identity (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear vs. Hope), Success Orientation (Envy vs. Compersion), Relational Climate (Enmity vs. Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative vs. Cohesive Goals).

The primary metrics for comparison were the `overall_cohesion_index`, which measures the net cohesive or fragmentative impact, and the `strategic_contradiction_index`, which quantifies the simultaneous use of opposing rhetorical appeals. Framework performance was evaluated using internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) and the statistical significance of differences between the texts (ANOVA p-values).

#### **Results**

The analysis confirms that institutional and populist discourse employ fundamentally different strategies to shape social cohesion, supporting hypothesis H3. The framework's key metrics were highly effective at differentiating the two styles, with the `overall_cohesion_index` (p=0.001), `amity` (p=0.000), `cohesive_goals` (p=0.000), and `enmity` (p=0.003) all showing statistically significant differences.

**1. Institutional Discourse Signature: Strategic Cohesion (McCain)**

Confirming hypothesis H1, McCain's speech is overwhelmingly cohesive. It scored significantly higher on dimensions of amity, individual dignity, and cohesive goals. This is demonstrated through explicit appeals to national unity. The text states: **"Tonight ... I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or Senator Obama."** The speech's focus on shared, constructive objectives is also clear, as evidenced by the call **"...to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity..."**

Anomalously, the speech registered a high `Strategic Contradiction Index`. This is not rhetorical failure but a feature of the concession genre. McCain balances high-amity appeals with acknowledgements of prior enmity, thereby validating his supporters' struggle while promoting a peaceful transition. As evidenced by: **"Senator Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain."** This duality is a sophisticated strategy to bridge a divided electorate.

**2. Populist Discourse Signature: In-Group Mobilization (Sanders)**

Partially confirming hypothesis H2, Sanders' speech exhibits a strongly fragmentative profile, driven by high enmity and envy scores. The rhetoric establishes a clear "us vs. them" narrative. As evidenced by: **"We will not accept an oligarchic form of society."** Hostility toward the out-group is stated directly, as the text states: **"These guys... they are not nice guys."**

Crucially, the cohesive elements present in the speech (e.g., hope) are not aimed at universal bridging but at consolidating the in-group. This creates a pattern of enmity-fueled hope, where the vision for a better future is predicated on defeating an opponent. As evidenced by: **"...if we stand together... not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve."** The analysis found no corresponding amity or compassion toward the designated out-group.

**3. Framework Performance**

The CFF demonstrated a strong overall fit for this analysis. The **Relational Climate Axis** (α=0.95), **Goal Orientation Axis** (α=0.91), and **Success Orientation Axis** (α=0.78) were particularly robust, showing both excellent internal reliability and strong discriminant validity across all their dimensions (all p<0.05). The **Identity** and **Emotional Climate** axes showed mixed performance; while highly reliable, the `tribal_dominance` (p=0.061) and `fear` (p=0.150) dimensions were not statistically significant differentiators in this specific comparison.

#### **Conclusion**

This study successfully demonstrates that institutional and populist discourses generate distinct and measurable social cohesion signatures. Institutional concession rhetoric (McCain) utilizes a complex strategy of high cohesion combined with acknowledged, residual enmity to bridge national divides. In contrast, populist critique (Sanders) weaponizes cohesive appeals like hope to foster in-group solidarity for the fragmentative purpose of defeating a defined out-group.

The findings highlight the utility of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework in moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to reveal the sophisticated rhetorical mechanics underlying political communication. The distinction between universal cohesion and in-group cohesion is a critical insight for understanding how modern discourse can simultaneously build community for some while deepening social fractures for all.
