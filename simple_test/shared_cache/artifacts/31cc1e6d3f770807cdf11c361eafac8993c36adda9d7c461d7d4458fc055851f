The document strongly emphasizes the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few corporations and individuals, framing this as a detrimental force ('oligarchy'). The rhetoric directly contrasts the interests of the 'people' with those of the wealthy elite, aligning with themes of justice and resistance against perceived exploitation."
