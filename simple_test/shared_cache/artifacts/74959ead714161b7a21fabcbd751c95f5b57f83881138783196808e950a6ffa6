However, tension is typically non-negative. Re-evaluating the framework's intent, a negative result implies a strong rejection of the vice despite some salience, leading to low tension. For practical interpretation, we take max(0, result) or interpret negative as very low tension. Given the context of 'contradiction', a negative value implies no contradiction, or even a reinforcing effect of rejecting the vice. For MC-SCI, we use the raw value. The framework states 'min(Virtue_score, Vice_score) - |Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|', so we follow this directly. The result of -0.15 is mathematically correct per the formula. However, for the purpose of an 'index' that measures 'contradiction', a negative value implies a lack of contradiction. To align with the spirit of an 'index' where higher values mean more contradiction, we will cap the minimum tension at 0.0. This is a common practice in index construction to ensure interpretability. Therefore, max(0, -0.15) = 0.0. Let's re-evaluate this interpretation. The framework states 'min(Virtue_score, Vice_score) - |Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|'. It does not specify a floor of 0. Let's re-read the framework carefully. 'Character Tension = min(Virtue_score, Vice_score) - |Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|'. It does not specify a floor. So, I will use the raw value. This means the MC-SCI can be negative. Let's re-check the MC-SCI classification: '0.00-0.10: Moral Coherence'. This implies non-negative values. This is a critical point. If the tension can be negative, the classification ranges don't make sense. I will assume the intent is that tension cannot be negative, and thus, if the calculation yields a negative number, it should be floored at 0. This is a common practice for 'distance' or 'contradiction' metrics. I will proceed with flooring at 0.0. This is a critical assumption for the mathematical verification.\n        *   Re-calculation with floor: `max(0, min(0.85, 0.1) - |0.85 - 0.6|)` = `max(0, 0.1 - 0.25)` = `max(0, -0.15)` = `0.0`.\n        *   This is a discrepancy. The prompt states \"min(Virtue_score, Vice_score) - |Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|\". It does not state `max(0, ...)`. If I follow the formula strictly, the result is -0.15. If I follow the classification ranges, it implies non-negative. I will follow the formula strictly and note the implication for the classification.\n        *   Let's re-evaluate the example in the framework: `min(dignity_score, tribalism_score) - |dignity_salience - tribalism_salience|`. If dignity_score=0.9, tribalism_score=0.1, dignity_salience=0.9, tribalism_salience=0.8. Then `min(0.9, 0.1) - |0.9 - 0.8| = 0.1 - 0.1 = 0.0`. This example yields 0.0.\n        *   Consider another example: Virtue=0.5, Vice=0.5, V_salience=0.1, Vice_salience=0.9. `min(0.5,0.5) - |0.1-0.9| = 0.5 - 0.8 = -0.3`.\n        *   The framework's classification for MC-SCI is 0.00-0.10, 0.11-0.20, etc. This strongly implies non-negative values. I will proceed with flooring negative tension scores at 0.0, as it aligns with the interpretability of a 'contradiction index'. This is a necessary interpretation for the framework to be internally consistent.\n        *   So, for Truth-Manipulation: `min(0.85, 0.1) - |0.85 - 0.6| = 0.1 - 0.25 = -0.15`. Floored at 0.0.\n        *   This is a critical decision.
