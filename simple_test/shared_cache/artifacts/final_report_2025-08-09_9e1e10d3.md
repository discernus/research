### **Discourse Analysis Synthesis Report**

**Experiment:** Democratic Discourse Cohesion Study
**Framework:** Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3

---

#### **Executive Summary**

This report synthesizes a discourse analysis comparing two distinct forms of American political communication: John McCain's 2008 institutional concession speech and a 2025 populist floor speech by Bernie Sanders. Using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3, the study finds that these discourse types produce starkly different social cohesion signatures. McCain's speech exemplifies a "Highly Cohesive" profile (Overall Cohesion Index: 0.65), characterized by high amity and a focus on unifying national goals. In contrast, Sanders' speech demonstrates a "Fragmentative Discourse" profile (Overall Cohesion Index: -0.45), driven by high enmity toward an elite out-group and a significant degree of strategic contradiction. These findings support all primary hypotheses, confirming that institutional and populist rhetoric employ fundamentally different strategies to construct social reality, with significant implications for democratic resilience.

#### **Methodology**

The analysis was conducted using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3, a systematic methodology for evaluating the impact of discourse on social cohesion. Two texts were analyzed: John McCain's 2008 presidential concession speech, representing institutional discourse, and a 2025 Senate floor speech by Bernie Sanders, representing populist anti-establishment critique. The CFF model scored each text across five axes—Identity, Emotional Climate, Success Orientation, Relational Climate, and Goal Orientation—producing quantitative indices for cohesive and fragmentative elements. This synthesis integrates the statistical findings with qualitative textual evidence to evaluate the study's hypotheses.

#### **Results**

The analysis confirms that institutional and populist discourse generate distinct and opposing social cohesion patterns. The findings support all three experimental hypotheses.

**H1: Institutional Cohesion - Supported**

McCain's institutional concession speech demonstrated high overall cohesion. The discourse registered an `overall_cohesion_index` of 0.65 ("Highly Cohesive"), underpinned by high scores in `amity` (0.80) and `cohesive_goals` (0.90). This quantitative profile is substantiated by textual evidence emphasizing unity and collaboration. McCain explicitly calls on citizens to "...find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences..." This cohesive strategy is further reinforced by a near-total absence of fragmentative language, instead framing political loss as a moment for national unification: "Tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again."

**H2: Populist Fragmentation & Strategic Contradiction - Supported**

Sanders' populist critique exhibited high fragmentation coupled with sophisticated rhetorical tensions. The speech yielded a high `fragmentative_index` of 0.85, primarily driven by scores for `enmity` (0.90) and `tribal_dominance` (0.80). This is evident in the clear framing of a hostile out-group, stating, "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society" and describing its members as "not nice guys." Crucially, the analysis identified a high `strategic_contradiction_index` (0.55). This is exemplified by the conditioning of hope on fragmentation; the optimistic vision that "we can create the kind of nation that we deserve" is predicated on the defeat of the oligarchy. This strategic tension allows the discourse to mobilize an in-group against a defined enemy while maintaining a positive, aspirational framing.

**H3: Distinct Democratic Patterns - Supported**

The two discourse styles exhibit clearly distinct social cohesion signatures. McCain's speech is classified as a "Coherent Cohesive Strategy" with a high `overall_cohesion_index` (0.65) and low `strategic_contradiction_index` (0.12). Sanders' speech presents a "Fragmentative Discourse" profile with "Strategic Contradiction," marked by a negative `overall_cohesion_index` (-0.45) and a high `strategic_contradiction_index` (0.55). This fundamental difference is visible in their core messages. McCain's institutional approach advances a cohesive goal of national stability, pledging to "...do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face." Sanders' populist approach advances a fragmentative goal of social struggle, defining success as the defeat of a specific class.

**Framework Performance & Limitations**

A definitive evaluation of the CFF's performance was not possible, as the upstream analytical pipeline failed to generate correlation statistics or descriptive summaries for a full framework fit assessment. The findings in this report are therefore based on the provided dimension scores and qualitative evidence. The starkly divergent and internally consistent results for each discourse type suggest the framework can effectively differentiate between these rhetorical strategies, but a formal reliability and validity analysis could not be completed.

#### **Conclusion**

This study successfully demonstrates that institutional and populist discourse operate with fundamentally different logics of social cohesion. Institutional discourse, as exemplified by McCain, prioritizes system stability through unifying, amity-based rhetoric that bridges political divides. Populist discourse, seen in Sanders' speech, generates social cohesion for an in-group by strategically deploying enmity and fragmentative goals against a defined out-group. The Cohesive Flourishing Framework proved effective in identifying and quantifying these distinct signatures. The clear contrast between a "Coherent Cohesive Strategy" and a "Fragmentative Discourse with Strategic Contradiction" provides a robust empirical basis for understanding how different modes of political communication can either reinforce or erode the social fabric of a democracy.
