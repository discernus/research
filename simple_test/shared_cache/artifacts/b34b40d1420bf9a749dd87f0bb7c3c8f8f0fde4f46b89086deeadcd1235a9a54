  "raw_analysis_response": "I will first decode the provided framework and documents.\nThen, for each document, I will apply the `analysis_prompt` from the framework.\nFor each analysis, I will meticulously evaluate the text against each dimension defined in the framework, assigning a score between 0.0 and 1.0 based on the scoring methodology.\nI will extract specific textual evidence to support each assigned score for every dimension.\nAfter scoring each dimension for all documents, I will calculate the composite scores: `virtue_score`, `vice_score`, and `civic_health_index`, showing all mathematical work.\nFinally, I will generate the `<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>` and `<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>` sections with the exact delimiters and structure as specified in the framework's output contract.\n\n**Decoding Framework:**\n\nThe provided framework is for \"Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v5.0\". It defines two main categories of dimensions: \"Virtues\" and \"Vices\".\n\n**Virtues Dimensions (0.0-1.0 scale):**\n*   `democratic_engagement`: Active participation in democratic processes and institutions.\n*   `institutional_trust`: Confidence in and support for democratic institutions.\n*   `civic_responsibility`: Recognition of duties and obligations as a citizen.\n*   `constructive_dialogue`: Engagement in respectful, evidence-based public discourse.\n*   `compromise_acceptance`: Willingness to accept democratic outcomes and negotiate solutions.\n\n**Vices Dimensions (0.0-1.0 scale):**\n*   `democratic_disengagement`: Withdrawal from or rejection of democratic processes.\n*   `institutional_distrust`: Suspicion of or hostility towards democratic institutions.\n*   `civic_irresponsibility`: Neglect of civic duties and obligations.\n*   `destructive_rhetoric`: Engagement in divisive, inflammatory, or evidence-free discourse.\n*   `zero_sum_thinking`: Unwillingness to compromise or accept democratic outcomes.\n\n**Composite Scores:**\n*   `virtue_score`: Average of virtue dimensions.\n*   `vice_score`: Average of vice dimensions.\n*   `civic_health_index`: `virtue_score` - `vice_score`.\n\n**Scoring Scale:**\n*   0.0-0.2: Absent or counterproductively deployed\n*   0.3-0.4: Weakly present with minimal effectiveness\n*   0.5-0.6: Moderately present with reasonable effectiveness\n*   0.7-0.8: Strongly present with high effectiveness\n*   0.9-1.0: Exceptionally present with maximum effectiveness\n\n**Analysis of Document 1:**\n\n**Document Content:**\nThe document is a manifesto advocating for radical change, expressing deep grievances and a rejection of the current system. It uses strong, emotionally charged language to describe oppression and calls for a complete overthrow of existing structures.\n\n**Dimension-by-Dimension Analysis:**\n\n*   **`democratic_engagement`**: The document explicitly rejects existing processes and calls for a complete overhaul, implying a withdrawal from and rejection of current democratic engagement.\n    *   Score: 0.1\n    *   Evidence: \"We've been patient long enough. Our suffering is proof. Our anger is holy.\" \"If you're not with us, you're against us.\" \"This is a war for survival, and if we hesitate, we lose everything.\" \"Act now or be erased.\"\n\n*   **`institutional_trust`**: The document expresses extreme distrust and hostility towards all existing institutions, viewing them as instruments of oppression.\n    *   Score: 0.1\n    *   Evidence: \"Every policy, every tradition, every institution in this country was built to keep *them* on top and *us* beneath.\" \"They still write the laws, own the media, fund the police, and shape your future.\" \"The system is rigged.\"\n\n*   **`civic_responsibility`**: The document frames its actions as a matter of survival and justice, implying a higher responsibility to its own group, but it rejects the responsibilities associated with the existing civic order.\n    *   Score: 0.2\n    *   Evidence: \"Our identity is not optional; it's imposed.\" \"Solitarity demands unity, not nuance.\" \"Our power will come only when we stop pretending we can all coexist and start claiming what's ours.\" \"Justice without revenge is just another lie.\"\n\n*   **`constructive_dialogue`**: The document dismisses dialogue and evidence that doesn't align with its lived experience, advocating for a narrative controlled by its own group.\n    *   Score: 0.1\n    *   Evidence: \"You think fairness is blind? It's never been blind\u2014it's been looking the other way.\" \"Facts can be debated, but our lived experience is not up for discussion.\" \"If data doesn't reflect our reality, the data is flawed\u2014or worse, part of the system.\" \"We don't owe objectivity to oppressors.\"\n\n*   **`compromise_acceptance`**: The document explicitly rejects compromise and negotiation, calling for a complete overthrow and the silencing of opposing voices.\n    *   Score: 0.0\n    *   Evidence: \"Don't talk to us about 'procedure' or 'due process'\u2014those were invented to keep power in the wrong hands.\" \"Until our pain is fully acknowledged and compensated, until our enemies know what it's like to lose what we lost, there can be no reconciliation\u2014only retribution.\" \"They won't give up power without a fight\u2014and neither will we.\" \"Burn it down.\"\n\n*   **`democratic_disengagement`**: The document advocates for a complete rejection of the current system and its processes, aligning with disengagement.\n    *   Score: 0.9\n    *   Evidence: \"We've been patient long enough.\" \"Our anger is holy.\" \"If you're not with us, you're against us.\" \"Act now or be erased.\" \"Burn it down.\"\n\n*   **`institutional_distrust`**: The document exhibits extreme distrust and animosity towards all established institutions.\n    *   Score: 1.0\n    *   Evidence: \"Every policy, every tradition, every institution in this country was built to keep *them* on top and *us* beneath.\" \"They still write the laws, own the media, fund the police, and shape your future.\" \"The system is rigged.\"\n\n*   **`civic_irresponsibility`**: The document rejects the responsibilities of the existing civic order, prioritizing its own group's perceived rights and retribution.\n    *   Score: 0.8\n    *   Evidence: \"Solitarity demands unity, not nuance.\" \"Our power will come only when we stop pretending we can all coexist and start claiming what's ours.\" \"Justice without revenge is just another lie.\"\n\n*   **`destructive_rhetoric`**: The document employs highly inflammatory, divisive, and emotionally charged language, rejecting factual debate.\n    *   Score: 1.0\n    *   Evidence: \"Our suffering is proof.
