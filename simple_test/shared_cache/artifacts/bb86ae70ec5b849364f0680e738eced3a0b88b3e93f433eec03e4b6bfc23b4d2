# Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v5.0

**Version**: 5.0
**Status**: Active
**Major Change**: Embedded CSV Architecture for Synthesis Scalability

---

## Executive Summary

The Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v5.0 integrates breakthrough constitutional tension analysis to provide a multi-dimensional assessment of democratic health. It quantifies contradictions between procedural legitimacy and rejection, institutional respect and subversion, and systemic continuity and replacement. This allows for a nuanced understanding of constitutional stability and democratic resilience.

## Framework Dimensions

### **Procedural Axis**
1. **Procedural Legitimacy** (0.0-1.0): Recognition of democratic processes and institutional procedures
2. **Procedural Rejection** (0.0-1.0): Dismissal of established democratic norms and procedures

### **Institutional Axis**  
3. **Institutional Respect** (0.0-1.0): Deference to democratic institutions and their authority
4. **Institutional Subversion** (0.0-1.0): Attempts to undermine or bypass institutional constraints

### **Systemic Axis**
5. **Systemic Continuity** (0.0-1.0): Support for constitutional stability and incremental change
6. **Systemic Replacement** (0.0-1.0): Calls for fundamental constitutional or system transformation

## Constitutional Health Mathematics

### **Constitutional Health Scoring**

**Procedural Health**: `Procedural Legitimacy - Procedural Rejection`
**Institutional Health**: `Institutional Respect - Institutional Subversion`  
**Systemic Health**: `Systemic Continuity - Systemic Replacement`

### **Constitutional Direction Index (CDI)**

**Formula**: `CDI = (Procedural Health + Institutional Health + Systemic Health) / 3`

Phase 2: Framework Methodology: Your task is to analyze the text using the Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v5.0. Phase 3: Operational Definitions: Evaluate six dimensions across three axes: Procedural (Legitimacy vs. Rejection), Institutional (Respect vs. Subversion), and Systemic (Continuity vs. Replacement). Phase 4: Scoring Protocol: Score each of the six dimensions from 0.0 to 1.0 for both intensity and salience. Provide the strongest 1-2 quotes as evidence. Phase 5: Embedded CSV Generation: CRITICAL: Your response must include two embedded CSV segments using these exact delimiters: <<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>> and <<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>. The scores CSV must have columns for each dimension's score and salience, plus the calculated health scores. The evidence CSV must have columns for dimension, quote, and confidence. Phase 6: Output Specification: Return a complete response containing both a comprehensive JSON analysis and the embedded CSV segments as specified in the output_contract."
