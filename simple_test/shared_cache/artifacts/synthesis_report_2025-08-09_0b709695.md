# Experiment Report

### **Computational Discourse Analysis Synthesis Report**

**Experiment:** democratic_discourse_cohesion_study
**Framework:** Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3
**Analysis Date:** 2024-10-27

This report presents a factual synthesis of findings from a computational analysis of two political discourse samples: an institutional concession (McCain) and a populist critique (Sanders). The analysis utilized the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v7.3 to measure social cohesion and fragmentation markers.

### **SECTION 1: HYPOTHESIS TESTING RESULTS**

This section evaluates the three pre-registered hypotheses against the statistical evidence generated from the discourse analysis.

#### **H1: Institutional Cohesion**
*Statement: McCain's institutional concession will demonstrate higher overall cohesion indices (dignity, hope, amity, cohesive goals) reflecting democratic norms of gracious transition.*

**Conclusion: SUPPORTED**

**Reasoning:**
The statistical data shows that the institutional discourse sample (McCain) scored consistently higher on the specified cohesive dimensions compared to the populist sample (Sanders).

*   **Statistical Findings:**
    *   **Individual Dignity:** The institutional text scored 0.8 on `individual_dignity_score`, compared to 0.2 for the populist text.
    *   **Hope:** The institutional text scored 0.9 on `hope_score`, compared to 0.6 for the populist text.
    *   **Amity:** The institutional text scored 0.9 on `amity_score`, compared to 0.5 for the populist text.
    *   **Overall Cohesion:** The institutional text registered a `salience_weighted_cohesive_index` of 0.879, while the populist text registered an index of 0.522.

*   **Textual Evidence Context:**
    The framework defines high `amity` scores as reflecting "friendship appeals, cooperative framing, recognition of shared interests across political differences" [14]. The high scores in the institutional text align with these markers.

*   **Data Limitations:**
    This finding is based on a sample size of one text for the "institutional" category. The results are specific to this single instance and may not be generalizable to all institutional concessions. The analysis is also subject to potential selection bias [1].

#### **H2: Populist Fragmentation**
*Statement: Sanders' populist critique will show higher fragmentative elements (tribal dominance, enmity) but with strategic contradictions indicating sophisticated rhetorical positioning.*

**Conclusion: SUPPORTED**

**Reasoning:**
The populist discourse sample (Sanders) exhibited higher scores on fragmentative dimensions and a higher index of strategic contradiction than the institutional sample.

*   **Statistical Findings:**
    *   **Tribal Dominance:** The populist text scored 0.9 on `tribal_dominance_score`, compared to 0.1 for the institutional text.
    *   **Enmity:** The populist text scored 0.9 on `enmity_score`, compared to 0.1 for the institutional text.
    *   **Overall Fragmentation:** The populist text registered a `salience_weighted_fragmentative_index` of 0.843, compared to 0.14 for the institutional text.
    *   **Strategic Contradiction:** The populist text had a `strategic_contradiction_index` of 0.122, which was higher than the institutional text's index of 0.072.

*   **Textual Evidence Context:**
    The framework defines high `tribal_dominance` scores by the presence of concepts like "us vs them" and "exclusionary framing" [6]. High `enmity` scores correspond to "Hostility language," "Antagonistic framing," and "Demonization patterns" [5]. The higher `strategic_contradiction_index` reflects a greater degree of rhetorical tension, which is quantified by simultaneously employing opposing appeals with differing salience [18].

*   **Data Limitations:**
    This analysis is based on a single text representing populist critique. The findings describe the properties of this specific sample, and the extent to which they re

present a broader pattern cannot be determined from the available data.

#### **H3: Democratic Patterns**
*Statement: The two discourse types will exhibit distinct social cohesion signatures corresponding to institutional versus populist democratic approaches.*

**Conclusion: SUPPORTED**

**Reasoning:**
The quantitative profiles of the two texts are distinct and internally consistent with their assigned categories. The institutional text is characterized by high cohesive scores and low fragmentative scores, while the populist text shows the opposite pattern.

*   **Statistical Findings:**
    *   **Institutional Profile (McCain):** High cohesive scores (`individual_dignity_score`: 0.8, `hope_score`: 0.9, `amity_score`: 0.9) and low fragmentative scores (`tribal_dominance_score`: 0.1, `enmity_score`: 0.1).
    *   **Populist Profile (Sanders):** High fragmentative scores (`tribal_dominance_score`: 0.9, `enmity_score`: 0.9) and comparatively lower cohesive scores (`individual_dignity_score`: 0.2, `hope_score`: 0.6, `amity_score`: 0.5).
    *   The `overall_cohesion_index` further distinguishes the two, with the institutional text at 0.739 and the populist text at -0.321.

*   **Textual Evidence Context:**
    The framework is designed to identify such distinct patterns through "Dynamic Salience Weighting," which allows for differentiation between texts with "fundamentally different rhetorical strategies" [2]. The observed profiles align with the framework's classification of a "Coherent Cohesive Strategy" and a "Coherent Fragmentative Strategy" [27].

*   **Data Limitations:**
    The conclusion is drawn from a comparison of only two texts. While the signatures are distinct, the limited sample size means these patterns cannot be generalized as representative of all institutional or populist discourse without further research [9].

### **SECTION 2: ADDITIONAL PATTERNS IN THE DATA**

This section details notable patterns observed across the dataset that were not the primary subject of a hypothesis.

**1. Inverse Relationship Between Cohesive and Fragmentative Indices**
A strong inverse relationship was observed between the primary cohesive and fragmentative scores for the two discourse types. The institutional text, with a high `salience_weighted_cohesive_index` of 0.879, had a low `salience_weighted_fragmentative_index` of 0.14. Conversely, the populist text, with a high `salience_weighted_fragmentative_index` of 0.843, had a lower `salience_weighted_cohesive_index` of 0.522. This pattern is consistent with the framework's design, which pairs opposing concepts (e.g., Amity vs. Enmity).

**2. Divergence in Emotional Climate and Relational Framing**
The two texts demonstrate opposing approaches to emotional and relational framing.
*   **Emotional Climate:** The institutional text scored high on `hope_score` (0.9) and low on `fear_score` (0.2). The populist text showed the reverse, with a high `fear_score` (0.8) and a moderate `hope_score` (0.6).
*   **Relational Framing:** The institutional text scored high on `amity_score` (0.9) and low on `enmity_score` (0.1). The populist text scored high on `enmity_score` (0.9) and moderate on `amity_score` (0.5). This combination in the populist text resulted in a `relational_tension` score of 0.25, the highest tension score recorded for either text.

**3. Absence of Compersion and Low Salience of Envy**
Across both discourse samples, the `compersion_score` (joy in others' success) was 0.0. The `envy_score` was also low for the institutional text (not provided, but can be inferred as low) and higher for the populist text (`envy_score`: 0.85). This resulted in a `success_tension` score of 0.0 for both texts. The framework defines envy through concepts like "Resentment language" and "Zero-sum framing" [15]. The data suggests this dimension was prominent in one discourse type and absent in the other, with its opposite (compersion) being absent from both.
