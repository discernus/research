Overall Educational Value:**\n*   **Definition:** Weighted average of the three group scores.

The composite scores are calculated as averages. For the final `overall_educational_value`, the average of the composite scores is calculated and then rounded to one decimal place to align with the specified precision.\n\n**Revised Scores based on calculation and rounding:**\n\n*   `content_quality_score`: 0.75 -> 0.8 (rounding up to nearest 0.1)\n*   `pedagogical_effectiveness_score`: 0.65 -> 0.7 (rounding up to nearest 0.1)\n*   `learning_accessibility_score`: 0.75 -> 0.8 (rounding up to nearest 0.1)\n*   `overall_educational_value`: (0.8 + 0.7 + 0.8) / 3 = 2.3 / 3 = 0.766... -> 0.8 (rounding up to nearest 0.1)\n\n**Final Scores for CSV:**\n\n*   `accuracy_verification`: 0.8\n*   `curriculum_alignment`: 0.7\n*   `depth_coverage`: 0.6\n*   `relevance_context`: 0.9\n*   `instructional_clarity`: 0.8\n*   `engagement_strategies`: 0.7\n*   `differentiation_support`: 0.6\n*   `assessment_integration`: 0.5\n*   `universal_design`: 0.9\n*   `language_clarity`: 0.9\n*   `multimedia_integration`: 0.5\n*   `barrier_reduction`: 0.7\n*   `content_quality_score`: 0.8\n*   `pedagogical_effectiveness_score`: 0.7\n*   `learning_accessibility_score`: 0.8\n*   `overall_educational_value`: 0.8",
