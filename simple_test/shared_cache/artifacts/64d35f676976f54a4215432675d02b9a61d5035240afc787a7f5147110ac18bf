  "raw_analysis_response": "Here's the analysis of the provided document based on the Character Assessment Framework v5.0.\n\n**Analysis of document1.txt**\n\nThe document expresses a strong sentiment of grievance and a call for radical change, rooted in historical oppression and systemic injustice. The speaker advocates for a unified, forceful approach to reclaim what they believe has been unjustly taken. There's a clear rejection of compromise and a demand for retribution, framing the struggle as one for survival and the creation of a new world order.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nThe framework requires scoring each virtue and vice dimension on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, and then calculating a \"saliency\" score for each. Saliency is defined as the absolute difference between the virtue and vice scores for each pair. The framework also specifies a \"Character Tension Score\" for each pair, calculated as `min(Virtue_score, Vice_score) * abs(Virtue_saliency - Vice_saliency)`. Finally, the overall Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI) is calculated by summing all Character Tension Scores and dividing by the number of opposing pairs (which is 5).\n\n**Phase 1: Cognitive Priming & Phase 2: Framework Methodology**\nThe document's language is highly charged, employing terms like \"suffering,\" \"anger,\" \"holy,\" \"justice,\" \"oppressors,\" \"oppressed,\" \"betrayal,\" \"pain,\" \"revenge,\" and \"force.\" This indicates a strong emotional and ideological stance.\n\n**Phase 3: Operational Definitions & Phase 4: Scoring Protocol**\n\n**Virtues:**\n\n*   **Dignity:** The text implies a stolen dignity and a demand for its restoration. The sentiment is that their inherent worth has been disregarded.\n    *   Score: 0.9\n    *   Saliency: 0.9 (High emphasis on the concept of dignity being violated)\n*   **Truth:** The speaker asserts their lived experience as a more valid form of truth than external data, and that they will control the narrative.\n    *   Score: 0.8\n    *   Saliency: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on their truth being paramount)\n*   **Justice:** Justice is explicitly linked to \"revenge\" and \"retribution,\" not fairness or due process. It's seen as something to be taken, not granted.\n    *   Score: 0.7\n    *   Saliency: 0.7 (Justice is a core demand, but framed as vengeance)\n*   **Hope:** Hope is presented as achievable only through radical destruction and rebuilding, not through incremental progress.\n    *   Score: 0.6\n    *   Saliency: 0.6 (Hope is conditional on extreme action)\n*   **Pragmatism:** The document advocates for a pragmatic approach to achieving their goals, but this pragmatism is rooted in forceful action and destruction of the existing system.\n    *   Score: 0.7\n    *   Saliency: 0.7 (Practicality of achieving goals through force)\n\n**Vices:**\n\n*   **Tribalism:** There's a strong \"us vs. them\" mentality, with a clear division between oppressors and the oppressed. Dissent within their ranks is labeled as betrayal.\n    *   Score: 0.9\n    *   Saliency: 0.9 (Extremely high emphasis on group loyalty over universal principles)\n*   **Manipulation:** The text suggests controlling the narrative and rewriting history, implying a manipulative approach to information.\n    *   Score: 0.7\n    *   Saliency: 0.7 (Intent to control narrative and redefine truth)\n*   **Resentment:** The entire discourse is fueled by deep-seated resentment over past injustices.\n    *   Score: 0.9\n    *   Saliency: 0.9 (Overwhelming focus on past grievances)\n*   **Fear:** While not explicitly stated as fear, the call for immediate, forceful action suggests a fear of continued subjugation and annihilation if they don't act.\n    *   Score: 0.5\n    *   Saliency: 0.5 (Underlying fear driving the urgency)\n*   **Fantasy:** The idea of a \"better world\" achieved through complete destruction and rebuilding could be seen as a utopian fantasy, though the speaker frames it as achievable justice.\n    *   Score: 0.4\n    *   Saliency: 0.4 (The utopian aspect of the desired outcome)\n\n**Phase 5: Calculations**\n\n**Character Tension Scores:**\n\n*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism:**\n    *   `min(0.9, 0.9) * abs(0.9 - 0.9)` = `0.9 * 0.0` = `0.0`\n*   **Truth vs. Manipulation:**\n    *   `min(0.8, 0.7) * abs(0.8 - 0.7)` = `0.7 * 0.1` = `0.07`\n*   **Justice vs. Resentment:**\n    *   `min(0.7, 0.9) * abs(0.7 - 0.9)` = `0.7 * 0.2` = `0.14`\n*   **Hope vs. Fear:**\n    *   `min(0.6, 0.5) * abs(0.6 - 0.5)` = `0.5 * 0.1` = `0.05`\n*   **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy:**\n    *   `min(0.7, 0.4) * abs(0.7 - 0.4)` = `0.4 * 0.3` = `0.12`\n\n**Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI):**\n\n*   Sum of Character Tension Scores = `0.0 + 0.07 + 0.14 + 0.05 + 0.12` = `0.38`\n*   Number of Opposing Pairs = `5`\n*   MC-SCI = `0.38 / 5` = `0.076`\n\n**Saliency Ranking:**\n\n1.  Dignity: 0.9\n2.  Tribalism: 0.9\n3.  Resentment: 0.9\n4.  Truth: 0.8\n5.  Manipulation: 0.7\n6.  Justice: 0.7\n7.  Pragmatism: 0.7\n8.  Hope: 0.6\n9.  Fear: 0.5\n10. Fantasy: 0.4\n\n**Phase 6: Output Specification**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"document1.txt\",\n  \"analysis_results\": {\n    \"dignity\": {\n      \"score\": 0.9,\n      \"saliency\": 0.9,\n      \"tension_score\": 0.0,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"quote\": \"Our identity is not optional; it's imposed.
