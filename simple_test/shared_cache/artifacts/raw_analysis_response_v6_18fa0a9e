    "analysis_notes": "The document, a political speech, heavily emphasizes economic inequality and a clear 'us vs. them' narrative. This focus naturally results in high scores for dimensions related to division, fear, and zero-sum conflict (tribal dominance, fear, envy, enmity, fragmentary goals). Hope and cohesive goals are present, but framed in the context of overcoming the identified 'oligarchs' rather than broad, inclusive collaboration. Compassion is absent. Individual dignity is implicitly valued for the 'common people' but not as a universal principle extending to the 'opposing' wealthy class."
