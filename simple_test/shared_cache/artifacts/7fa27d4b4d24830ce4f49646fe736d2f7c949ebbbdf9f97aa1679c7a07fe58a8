  "raw_analysis_response": "It looks like you're asking me to perform a moral and ethical analysis on a provided document using a specific framework. However, the framework you've provided is quite extensive and includes calculations for various \"moral foundation pairs\" and a \"Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)\".\n\nThe analysis requires a deep understanding of Moral Foundations Theory and its application to text. I need to:\n\n1.  **Decode the framework and document.**\n2.  **Identify specific keywords and phrases** within the document that relate to the 12 moral foundations (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, Liberty/Oppression).\n3.  **Score the intensity and salience** of each foundation in the document on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.\n4.  **Calculate the \"Moral Tension\"** for each of the 6 foundation pairs using the provided formulas:\n    *   `Moral Tension = min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) \u2228 |Foundation_salience - Opposition_salience|`\n    *   Specifically for pairs:\n        *   `Care/Harm Tension = min(Care, Harm) \u2228 |Care_salience - Harm_salience|`\n        *   `Fairness/Cheating Tension = min(Fairness, Cheating) \u2228 |Fairness_salience - Cheating_salience|`\n        *   `Loyalty/Betrayal Tension = min(Loyalty, Betrayal) \u2228 |Loyalty_salience - Betrayal_salience|`\n        *   `Authority/Subversion Tension = min(Authority, Subversion) \u2228 |Authority_salience - Subversion_salience|`\n        *   `Sanctity/Degradation Tension = min(Sanctity, Degradation) \u2228 |Sanctity_salience - Degradation_salience|`\n        *   `Liberty/Oppression Tension = min(Liberty, Oppression) \u2228 |Liberty_salience - Oppression_salience|`\n5.  **Calculate the \"Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)\"**:\n    *   `MSCI = (Sum of all Moral Tension Scores) / Number of Foundation Pairs`\n6.  **Extract evidence**: 1-2 quotes per foundation, along with confidence scores and context type.\n7.  **Format the output** into the specified CSV sections.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for nuanced interpretation of the text against the theoretical framework, I will proceed with the analysis.\n\n```\n<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\naid,care,harm,fairness,cheating,loyalty,betrayal,authority,subversion,sanctity,degradation,liberty,oppression,care_salience,harm_salience,fairness_salience,cheating_salience,loyalty_salience,betrayal_salience,authority_salience,subversion_salience,sanctity_salience,degradation_salience,liberty_salience,oppression_salience,care_harm_tension,fairness_cheating_tension,loyalty_betrayal_tension,authority_subversion_tension,sanctity_degradation_tension,liberty_oppression_tension,moral_strategic_contradiction_index\n{artifact_id},0.8,0.7,0.6,0.3,0.3,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.2,0.3,0.7,0.6,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.2,0.2,0.5,0.2,0.7,0.1,0.4,0.8,0.7,0.7,0.3,0.2,0.3,0.1,0.7,0.42\n<<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>\naid,dimension,quote_id,quote_text,confidence_score,context_type\n{artifact_id},care,1,\"\"\"We've been patient long enough.
