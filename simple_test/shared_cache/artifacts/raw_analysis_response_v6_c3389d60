This context strongly influences the dimensional scores, resulting in high values for positive dimensions (Amity, Hope, Compersion) and low values for negative ones (Enmity, Fear, Tribal Dominance). The dimension 'compersion' is particularly salient, as the speaker explicitly expresses admiration for his opponent's historic achievement."
