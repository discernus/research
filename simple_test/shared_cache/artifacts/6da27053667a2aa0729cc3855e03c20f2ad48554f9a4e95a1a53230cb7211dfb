### üèõÔ∏è **Framework Overview: Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.0**

This experiment utilized the Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v7.0, a methodology designed to assess the civic character of political discourse. Grounded in civic republican theory, CAF v7.0 evaluates communication across five core dimensions, each representing a tension between a civic virtue and its corresponding counter-virtue:

1.  **Dignity vs. Tribalism** (Identity Axis)
2.  **Truth vs. Manipulation** (Information Axis)
3.  **Justice vs. Resentment** (Equity Axis)
4.  **Hope vs. Fear** (Emotional Axis)
5.  **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy** (Reality Axis)

A key feature of the v7.0 implementation is its "gasket architecture," which relies on an Analysis Agent producing a human-readable `Raw Analysis Log`. An `Intelligent Extractor` is then responsible for parsing this log to populate a structured schema for statistical processing. This experiment was specifically designed to be a "smoke test" for this new architecture.

### üìú **Corpus Profile**

The analysis was conducted on a small, ideologically opposed corpus of two documents:

*   **`john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`**: A 2008 presidential concession speech by John McCain, selected to represent a traditional, institutional, and conservative form of political discourse.
*   **`bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`**: A 2025 Senate floor speech by Bernie Sanders, selected for its populist, progressive critique of economic structures.

This corpus was intentionally designed to create high contrast across the CAF dimensions, providing a clear test case for the framework's ability to differentiate between distinct civic character profiles.

### **Executive Summary**

This report details the results of the `simple_character_validation_v7` experiment, a validation test of the Discernus v7.0 gasket architecture. The experiment resulted in a **critical processing failure**, preventing the validation of the primary scientific hypotheses regarding ideological character differences (H1) and character profile differentiation (H2). The statistical analysis pipeline failed at the initial data extraction stage, with the `Intelligent Extractor` unable to parse any civic dimension scores from the `Raw Analysis Log`. Consequently, no derived metrics were calculated, and no statistical comparisons could be performed.

While failing to produce substantive findings about the corpus, the experiment successfully fulfilled its function as a system diagnostic. The primary outcome is the identification of a severe flaw in the v7.0 gasket architecture, specifically at the interface between the natural language analysis output and the structured data extraction module. The experiment's third hypothesis (H3), which predicted the architecture would successfully process the analysis, was **conclusively rejected**. The extremely limited evidence base, consisting of a single curated artifact with no text content, further underscores the systemic nature of the failure in this run.

### üî¨ **Hypothesis Testing Results**

The experiment was designed to test three core hypotheses. Due to the data processing failure, none could be adequately tested for their intended scientific insights. The results below reflect the status of the test itself.

| Hypothesis | Description | Finding | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **H1: Ideological Differences** | Character dimensions will show significant differences between conservative (McCain) and progressive (Sanders) speakers. | ‚ùå **FAILED TO TEST** | The `Intelligent Extractor` failed to parse any civic dimension scores. Without scores, no comparison between ideologies could be performed. |
| **H2: Coherence Differentiation** | MC-SCI scores will differentiate between institutional (McCain) and populist (Sanders) discourse. | ‚ùå **FAILED TO TEST** | MC-SCI (Civic Character Index) scores could not be calculated due to the absence of the underlying base dimension scores. |
| **H3: Architecture Processing** | The v7.0 gasket architecture will successfully process the 2-document character analysis with Raw Analysis Log processing. | ‚ùå **REJECTED** | The architecture failed at its core task. The `Raw Analysis Log processing` step did not yield any usable data, demonstrating a critical breakdown in the pipeline. |

### üìâ **Detailed Statistical Analysis**

The failure of the data extraction process precluded all quantitative analysis. The sections below document the absence of results where statistical summaries would normally appear.

#### **Civic Dimension Score Table**

The following table was intended to display the CAF v7.0 scores for each document. However, no data was successfully extracted.

| Document | Dignity | Tribalism | Truth | Manipulation | Justice | Resentment | Hope | Fear | Pragmatism | Fantasy | CCI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `john_mccain_2008...` | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| `bernie_sanders_2025...`| ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
*Data unavailable due to a critical error in the Raw Analysis Log processing pipeline.*

#### **Metric Distribution & Correlation Analysis**

No metric distributions, correlation matrices, or reliability analyses (e.g., Cronbach's Œ±) could be generated. The absence of numerical data made these analytical tasks impossible to execute, leading to the series of failures noted in the provenance metadata.

### **Evidence Integration**

The analysis pipeline's failure extended to the evidence curation process, which yielded only a single artifact. This piece of evidence, curated from the Bernie Sanders speech, was associated with the **Dignity** dimension and intended to support an assertion of universal human worth [1]. However, the evidence itself lacks textual content, which points to a potential flaw in the evidence logging or retrieval mechanism. This severe limitation prevents any meaningful synthesis of qualitative evidence with quantitative findings, as neither data source is intact.

### üîë **Key Findings**

The primary findings of this experiment are diagnostic, revealing critical issues with the Discernus v7.0 platform rather than insights about the corpus.

1.  **Catastrophic Pipeline Failure:** The v7.0 gasket architecture experienced a complete breakdown. The `Intelligent Extractor` failed to parse numerical scores from the `Raw Analysis Log`, which is the foundational step for all subsequent analysis.
2.  **Hypotheses Untestable:** The failure to generate data rendered the primary research hypotheses (H1, H2) untestable. The experiment could not assess differences in civic character between the conservative and progressive speeches.
3.  **Architecture Validation Test Fails:** The experiment's core purpose‚Äîto validate the new architecture (H3)‚Äîresulted in a clear rejection. The system is not functioning as designed.
4.  **Systemic Error Propagation:** The initial extraction failure cascaded through the workflow, causing all dependent statistical tasks to fail, as documented in the error logs.
5.  **Evidence Curation Flaw:** The evidence base is functionally nonexistent. The single curated piece lacks text content [1], suggesting the data processing errors may also affect qualitative data streams.

### **Methodology Notes**

The methodology for this run was intended to be a straightforward application of the CAF v7.0 framework on a two-document corpus. However, the results are defined by the failure of that application.

*   **Experimental Design:** The choice of a high-contrast corpus (McCain vs. Sanders) was sound for testing the framework's discriminatory power, but the technical failure prevented this from being assessed.
*   **Data Processing:** The core methodological issue lies within the `Raw Analysis Log processing` workflow. This critical failure point must be the top priority for debugging.
*   **Limitations:** The primary limitation is the complete absence of analytical data. Furthermore, the warning of a "Limited evidence base" is an understatement; with only one, content-empty piece of evidence [1], no qualitative support is possible. The `CORPUS HANDLING POLICY` requires treating all metadata as factual, meaning we must formally report the system's failure to capture this evidence text.

### **Implications and Conclusions**

The `simple_character_validation_v7` experiment, while failing to produce its intended scientific output, has served its essential purpose as a "smoke test" by uncovering a critical-severity bug in the Discernus v7.0 platform. The conclusion is not about political discourse but about system readiness.

The v7.0 gasket architecture, in its current state, is not viable. The inability of the `Intelligent Extractor` to parse the `Raw Analysis Log` from the `Analysis Agent` indicates a fundamental schema mismatch, a parsing logic error, or a malformed output from the agent. This breaks the entire analytical chain.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Immediate Debugging:** A full diagnostic must be run on the `Raw Analysis Log` generated in this run to identify the source of the parsing failure.
2.  **Architecture Review:** The handoff between the Analysis Agent and the Intelligent Extractor needs to be re-validated against the `gasket_schema` specification.
3.  **Evidence System Audit:** The process for curating and storing evidence text must be investigated to understand why footnote [1] was saved without its content.

This experiment conclusively rejects the hypothesis that the v7.0 architecture can successfully process character analysis. It serves as an essential, if sobering, milestone in the development of the Discernus platform, redirecting focus toward critical infrastructure repair.
