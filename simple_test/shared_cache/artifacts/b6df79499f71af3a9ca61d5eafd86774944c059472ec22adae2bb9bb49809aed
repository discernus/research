  "raw_analysis_response": "The provided document \"document2.txt\" was analyzed using the \"Enman Framing Functions Framework v5.0\". The analysis aimed to evaluate the document across four framing dimensions: Problem Definition, Causal Attribution, Moral Evaluation, and Treatment Recommendation. Each dimension was scored on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, and the overall message completeness score was calculated as the average of these four dimensions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n**Document Analysis:**\n\n**Filename:** document2.txt\n**Hash:** af7878b2ed57...\n\n**1. Problem Definition:**\nThe document defines the core problem as the need for a future built on equality, dignity, and democratic renewal. It emphasizes building systems that reflect truth for everyone and highlights that individual dignity is inherent, not based on background but on the capacity to think, act, and contribute to the common good. It rejects essentialism and the reduction of people to categories, asserting that pluralism is a strength. The problem is framed as ensuring justice is inclusive and that past injustices are addressed through building fair, open, and future-focused systems.\n\n*   **Key Indicators Identified:**\n    *   \"Every person deserves a voice, a chance, and the freedom to live with dignity.\"\n    *   \"Our work is to build systems that reflect that truth for everyone.\"\n    *   \"Each individual carries inherent dignity, grounded not in their background but in their capacity to think, act, and contribute to the common good.\"\n    *   \"Pluralism is not a threat; it is a strength.\"\n    *   \"Our vision is inclusive because justice cannot be partial.\"\n    *   \"We commit to systems that are fair, open, and future-focused.\"\n\n*   **Score Calculation:**\n    *   The document clearly articulates a vision for a just society and identifies systemic issues rooted in past injustices and current inequalities. It establishes the scope and nature of the issues requiring public attention effectively.\n    *   **Score: 0.90**\n\n**2. Causal Attribution:**\nThe document attributes issues to past deep injustices, redlining, exclusion, exploitation, and inequality. However, it explicitly states that the past cannot be undone by mirroring its wrongs. Instead, it emphasizes a commitment to building fair, open, and future-focused systems. It notes that where inequities persist, they are addressed transparently and constructively, without creating new hierarchies of grievance. The cause of the need for improvement is linked to systemic flaws and historical wrongs, with a focus on future-oriented solutions rather than blame.\n\n*   **Key Indicators Identified:**\n    *   \"Our past contains deep injustices\u2014redlining, exclusion, exploitation, inequality.\"\n    *   \"We cannot undo the past by mirroring its wrongs.\"\n    *   \"We commit to systems that are fair, open, and future-focused.\"\n    *   \"Where inequities persist, we address them transparently and constructively, without creating new hierarchies of grievance.\"\n    *   \"We measure fairness not by whether one group 'wins,' but by whether the rules are just and universally applied.\"\n\n*   **Score Calculation:**\n    *   The document acknowledges past causes of inequity but shifts focus to systemic responsibility and future solutions. It assigns responsibility to the *systems* that allow inequities to persist, rather than solely to individuals or specific groups.\n    *   **Score: 0.85**\n\n**3. Moral Evaluation:**\nThe document strongly advocates for justice, fairness, liberty, and fundamental rights. It emphasizes core values such as integrity, moral imperative, and principles at stake. The language used (\"inherent dignity,\" \"justice cannot be partial,\" \"fairness,\" \"integrity\") indicates a clear moral stance. It asserts that what is happening is fundamentally wrong and ethically unacceptable. It calls for actions that uphold human dignity and ethical obligations.\n\n*   **Key Indicators Identified:**\n    *   \"Every person deserves a voice, a chance, and the freedom to live with dignity.\"\n    *   \"Justice cannot be partial.\"\n    *   \"Our moral case strengthens when grounded in truth.\"\n    *   \"We embrace data not to win arguments, but to solve problems.\"\n    *   \"Integrity means persuasion through clarity, not coercion.\"\n    *   \"Our credibility depends on intellectual honesty, even when it's inconvenient.\"\n\n*   **Score Calculation:**\n    *   The document consistently invokes moral principles like dignity, fairness, and justice. It evaluates current systems and past actions through an ethical lens, deeming injustice morally unacceptable.\n    *   **Score: 0.95**\n\n**4. Treatment Recommendation:**\nThe document recommends immediate action, focusing on building equitable systems. The core of the recommendation is iterative improvement, adaptation, and innovation within democratic institutions. It advocates for transparency and constructive approaches to address persistent inequities. The proposed approach involves experimentation, innovation, and policy adaptation, not panicky or reactive measures. It emphasizes building coalitions and aligning around shared goals for a better future.\n\n*   **Key Indicators Identified:**\n    *   \"We commit to building systems that are fair, open, and future-focused.\"\n    *   \"We focus on processes, not paybacks; on access, not revenge.\"\n    *   \"Where inequities persist, we address them transparently and constructively, without creating new hierarchies of grievance.\"\n    *   \"Change is necessary, but panic is not a strategy.\"\n    *   \"We meet uncertainty with resilience, not fear, and we trust in democratic institutions.\"\n    *   \"We build coalitions, not cults.\"\n    *   \"We pursue progress not by erasing our differences but by aligning around shared goals and a shared future.\"\n\n*   **Score Calculation:**\n    *   The document clearly outlines a path forward, advocating for systemic change, iterative improvement, and resilience. It suggests specific approaches like transparency, constructive dialogue, and coalition-building.\n    *   **Score: 0.88**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n*   **Message Completeness Score:**\n    *   (Problem Definition + Causal Attribution + Moral Evaluation + Treatment Recommendation) / 4\n    *   (0.90 + 0.85 + 0.95 + 0.88) / 4 = 3.58 / 4 = **0.895**\n\n---\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\naid,problem_definition,causal_attribution,moral_evaluation,treatment_recommendation,message_completeness_score\n{artifact_id},0.90,0.85,0.95,0.88,0.895\n<<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>\naid,dimension,quote_id,quote_text,confidence_score,context_type\n{artifact_id},problem_definition,1,\"Every person deserves a voice, a chance, and the freedom to live with dignity.
