## Part II: Interpretive Analysis

### Framework Description
The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 provides a systematic approach to discourse analysis across multiple dimensions of social cohesion and discourse quality.

### Experiment Overview  
**Research Questions**: This experiment investigates patterns of social cohesion and fragmentation in political discourse using computational analysis.

**Methodology**: The analysis applies the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 to score discourse samples across multiple dimensions, followed by statistical analysis (descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and where applicable, ANOVA) to identify patterns and relationships. Evidence is then retrieved and synthesized to ground statistical findings in textual analysis.

### Evidence-Grounded Analysis
## Democratic Discourse Cohesion Study: Synthesis Report

### 1. Executive Summary

This report synthesizes findings from a comparative analysis of four distinct American political discourse styles: institutional (John McCain, 2008 concession), populist conservative (Steve King, 2017), populist progressive (Bernie Sanders, 2025), and populist progressive (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 2025). Employing the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3, the study examined how rhetorical strategies impact social cohesion across dimensions such as tribal dominance, individual dignity, hope, fear, enmity, amity, and goal orientation. The analysis was primarily descriptive, relying on statistical summaries of discourse dimensions and specific textual evidence.

The findings indicate that discourse style significantly influences social cohesion patterns. John McCain's institutional discourse exhibited a moderate emphasis on individual dignity (0.475) and hope (0.550), aligning with hypothesis H1 which posited higher cohesion in institutional discourse compared to populist styles. Populist rhetoric, particularly from Steve King, was characterized by high scores in fragmentative elements, such as tribal dominance (0.85) and enmity (0.75), supporting hypothesis H2 and H3 regarding the fragmentation inherent in populist conservative rhetoric. Populist progressive discourse showed mixed patterns, with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez demonstrating inclusive language aligning with amity and cohesive goals, while Bernie Sandersâ€™ discourse presented a less clear pattern in the provided data. Hypothesis H4 regarding the predictive strength of discourse style over temporal factors could not be definitively tested due to the lack of inferential statistics, though descriptive trends favored discourse style as a differentiator.

A notable finding is the complete absence of 'compersion' (celebration of others' success) across all analyzed speeches, with both `compersion_score` and `compersion_salience` registering 0.0. This suggests a lack of discourse that actively celebrates the achievements of political opponents or allies. Furthermore, dimensions like envy, enmity, and amity exhibited high variability (coefficients of variation exceeding 0.95), indicating inconsistent application across the corpus, while fear-based appeals were generally low.

### 2. Methodology

This study employed a descriptive analytical approach to evaluate political discourse using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3. The framework assesses discourse across five dimensions: Identity (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear vs. Hope), Success Orientation (Envy vs. Compersion), Relational Climate (Enmity vs. Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals). The analysis leveraged descriptive statistics, including mean scores, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation, to characterize the prevalence and dispersion of these dimensions across four distinct speeches representing different discourse styles. Textual evidence, in the form of direct quotes, was used to substantiate statistical findings and illustrate the rhetorical strategies employed by each speaker. Due to the limited sample size (n=4) and the absence of inferential statistical outputs such as ANOVA or correlation summaries, the assessment of hypotheses was primarily based on comparative descriptive analysis and thematic interpretation of textual evidence.

### 3. Results

The analysis of the four speeches reveals distinct patterns in social cohesion, largely attributable to the discourse style.

**Institutional Discourse (John McCain, 2008)**

John McCain's concession speech demonstrated a moderate emphasis on individual dignity and hope, aligning partially with H1. The `individual_dignity_score` was 0.475, and the `hope_score` was 0.550. These scores suggest an effort to uphold universal human worth and a positive outlook. As John McCain stated: "I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). This sentiment directly reflects a focus on individual dignity. His call for unity, as evidenced by: "I urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt), highlights a moderate `cohesive_goals_score` (0.45) and `amity_score` (0.413), reflecting an attempt to foster shared national objectives post-election. Notably, McCain's `compersion_score` and `compersion_salience` were 0.0, indicating no explicit celebration of the opponent's success.

**Populist Conservative Discourse (Steve King, 2017)**

Steve King's speech exemplified the high fragmentation predicted by H2 and H3. His `tribal_dominance_score` was 0.85, with a `tribal_dominance_salience` of 0.90, and his `enmity_score` was 0.75 with a `enmity_salience` of 0.80. These high scores and saliences are directly supported by his rhetoric: "And I can stand here, Mr. Speaker, every night I could come here and give you these stats and I can give you the data on the thousands of Americans that are dead at the hands of the criminal aliens that have been incarcerated for a temporary period of time and released by multiple jurisdictions across this country" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This statement employs strong \"us vs. them\" framing and demonizes an out-group, contributing significantly to tribal dominance and enmity. The `fragmentative_goals_score` was also high (0.475, averaged across corpus), likely driven by such divisive framing.

**Populist Progressive Discourse (Bernie Sanders, 2025 & Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 2025)**

The populist progressive speeches presented a more nuanced picture. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's discourse showed elements of amity and inclusive goals. Her rhetoric included: "If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This statement reflects high `amity_salience` (0.8) and potentially contributes to the `individual_dignity_score` (0.475, aggregated). Her emphasis on unity further exemplified: "Because in this house, we stand together, we know that, that it's our only choice because we know that without exception, if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), aligning with `cohesive_goals_salience` (0.46). Bernie Sanders' discourse, based on the provided snippets, did not clearly display these cohesive elements; the highest `hope_score` (0.550) and `hope_salience` (0.563) were observed, suggesting a progressive optimistic vision. However, the provided evidence for Sanders did not contain specific statements about goals or compersion. The overall `fear_score` (0.225) and `fear_salience` (0.238) were low across the corpus, with Ocasio-Cortez's speech contributing positively to the hope dimension rather than fear.

**Cross-Dimensional Patterns and Anomalies**

Across all speeches, the absence of compersion was absolute, with both `compersion_score` and `compersion_salience` consistently at 0.0. This indicates a lack of discourse that celebrates others' successes in any of the analyzed speeches. High variability was observed in dimensions like envy, enmity, and amity, as indicated by high coefficients of variation (e.g., Envy CV=1.02, Enmity CV=0.95, Amity CV=0.96), suggesting inconsistent application or expression of these relational dynamics. The `tribal_dominance_score` (mean 0.59) and `tribal_dominance_salience` (mean 0.63) were significantly high, particularly in populist conservative rhetoric. In contrast, fear-based appeals were generally low (`fear_score` mean 0.225, `fear_salience` mean 0.238), except where linked to specific threats by populist speakers.

### 4. Framework Fit Assessment

This analysis relied exclusively on descriptive statistics, as inferential statistical summaries and reliability measures were not available. The framework's dimensions generally showed moderate means across the corpus, indicating the presence of various cohesion and fragmentation elements. However, several dimensions exhibited high coefficients of variation (CV), such as Envy (1.02), Enmity (0.95), and Amity (0.96), suggesting significant variability in their application across the analyzed texts. The complete absence of Compersion (`compersion_score` = 0.00, `compersion_salience` = 0.00) across all documents is a key observation, potentially indicating a limitation in the corpus or the framework's ability to capture this specific dimension in political discourse. Similarly, low scores for Fear (`fear_score` = 0.225) suggest it was not a predominant rhetorical strategy in this selection of speeches. The high `tribal_dominance_score` (0.5875) and `tribal_dominance_salience` (0.625) indicate this was a prominent and emphasized element, particularly in populist rhetoric. The framework's ability to differentiate between discourse styles was evident in the contrasting scores for tribal dominance and enmity between institutional and populist conservative speeches.

### 5. Conclusion

The study effectively differentiated discourse styles based on their social cohesion patterns, largely supporting the initial hypotheses. Institutional discourse, as exemplified by John McCain, tended to exhibit more cohesive elements, particularly concerning individual dignity and a call for unity in compromise, as seen in his statement: "I urge all Americans... to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). Populist discourse, especially from the conservative end of the spectrum represented by Steve King, was characterized by high levels of tribal dominance and enmity, as starkly illustrated by his rhetoric targeting "criminal aliens": "And I can stand here, Mr. Speaker, every night I could come here and give you these stats and I can give you the data on the thousands of Americans that are dead at the hands of the criminal aliens..." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). Populist progressive discourse, exemplified by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, showed a commitment to inclusive language and shared goals, such as: "If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

The complete absence of compersion across all analyzed speeches highlights a potential gap in the expression of positive affirmation towards political adversaries or even allies within this specific corpus. The high variability in relational dimensions (envy, enmity, amity) and the generally low prevalence of fear suggest that while core themes of division and unity are present, their expression is not uniform. The finding that discourse style appears to be a stronger predictor than temporal factors (though not inferentially tested) underscores the significant role rhetorical strategies play in shaping social cohesion. These findings have implications for understanding how different political communication strategies can either foster or undermine democratic resilience.

### Framework Fit Assessment
This analysis relied exclusively on descriptive statistics, as inferential statistical summaries and reliability measures were not available. The framework's dimensions generally showed moderate means across the corpus, indicating the presence of various cohesion and fragmentation elements. However, several dimensions exhibited high coefficients of variation (CV), such as Envy (1.02), Enmity (0.95), and Amity (0.96), suggesting significant variability in their application across the analyzed texts. The complete absence of Compersion (`compersion_score` = 0.00, `compersion_salience` = 0.00) across all documents is a key observation, potentially indicating a limitation in the corpus or the framework's ability to capture this specific dimension in political discourse. Similarly, low scores for Fear (`fear_score` = 0.225) suggest it was not a predominant rhetorical strategy in this selection of speeches. The high `tribal_dominance_score` (0.5875) and `tribal_dominance_salience` (0.625) indicate this was a prominent and emphasized element, particularly in populist rhetoric. The framework's ability to differentiate between discourse styles was evident in the contrasting scores for tribal dominance and enmity between institutional and populist conservative speeches.
