It frames the current state as one of systemic oppression where the in-group ('us') is subjugated by an external or elite 'them'. The language is highly emotional, emphasizing anger, suffering, and a desire for 'justice' defined as retribution. There's a clear rejection of existing institutions and established procedures, advocating for a complete dismantling of the current order and the creation of a new one controlled by 'us'. The rhetoric points towards a 'us vs. them' mentality, with a strong emphasis on collective identity and a rejection of neutrality or compromise. The document positions the in-group as victims of historical injustice and advocates for a forceful reclamation of what is perceived as theirs. The overall tone is confrontational, advocating for a 'war for survival' where inaction leads to annihilation.\",\n        \"scores\": {\n          \"vertical_axis_score\": 0.9,\n          \"horizontal_axis_score\": 0.85,\n          \"quadrant_classification\": \"Populism - Nationalism\"\n        },\n        \"evidence\": [\n          {\n            \"axis\": \"vertical_axis\",\n            \"quote_id\": \"q1\",\n            \"quote_text\": \"Our identity is not optional; it's imposed.
