## Discourse Analysis Synthesis: Cohesive Flourishing Framework Application

### Executive Summary

This report synthesizes findings from a discourse analysis conducted using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 on two speeches: John McCain's 2008 concession speech and Bernie Sanders' 2025 speech on fighting oligarchy. The analysis reveals significant correlations and tensions across different dimensions of social cohesion. Specifically, a strong inverse relationship was found between 'fear' and 'individual dignity', and between 'hope' and 'envy'. Conversely, 'fear' and 'fragmentative goals' were positively correlated, as were 'envy' and 'fear'. These findings highlight how rhetorical strategies can simultaneously employ appeals to universal human worth alongside crisis mentality, and resentment with divisive objectives. The analysis also points to potential inconsistencies in measuring certain dimensions, particularly 'envy' and 'fear', suggesting areas for methodological refinement.

### Methodology

The analysis employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3, which systematically evaluates political discourse across five dimensions: Identity, Emotional Climate, Success Orientation, Relational Climate, and Goal Orientation. Each dimension is assessed on a bipolar scale (e.g., Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity, Fear vs. Hope). The framework utilizes salience weighting to determine the rhetorical emphasis of these appeals. Quantitative analysis, including correlation summaries and descriptive statistics, was used to identify relationships between dimensions. Qualitative analysis of textual evidence was performed to support and contextualize the quantitative findings, adhering to specific citation requirements.

### Results

The application of the CFF v7.3 revealed several key patterns and correlations within the analyzed discourse.

**1. Identity and Emotional Climate Interplay:**

A strong inverse relationship was observed between 'fear' and 'individual dignity', with a perfect negative correlation ($r = -1.00$). This suggests that discourse emphasizing universal human worth tends to exhibit lower levels of fear-based appeals. For instance, John McCain's concession speech, which strongly emphasizes individual dignity, contains phrases like: "That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of Arizona for it" and "the failure is mine, not yours." In contrast, Bernie Sanders' speech, which shows higher 'fear_score' indicators, frames political opponents in terms of exploitative power, stating: "Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires." This aligns with the statistical finding that appeals to individual dignity are negatively associated with fear.

**2. Success Orientation and Emotional Climate Dynamics:**

A perfect negative correlation ($r = -1.00$) was found between 'hope' and 'envy', indicating that expressions of hope are inversely related to resentment or zero-sum thinking. Bernie Sanders' speech, while containing elements of hope such as "we can create the kind of nation that we deserve," also invokes a sense of grievance and disadvantage when discussing economic inequality: "They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer." This supports the statistical observation that hope is negatively correlated with envy.

Furthermore, a perfect positive correlation ($r = 1.00$) was identified between 'envy' and 'fear'. This suggests that rhetoric fostering resentment and zero-sum thinking often coincides with a crisis mentality. The text for Bernie Sanders' speech exemplifies this by linking economic grievances to a perceived threat: "Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires."

**3. Goal Orientation and Emotional Climate:**

A perfect positive correlation ($r = 1.00$) was observed between 'fear' and 'fragmentative goals'. This indicates that rhetoric invoking crisis and threat is often paired with objectives that promote division. John McCain's concession speech, while aiming for unity, also contains elements that could be interpreted as competitive or goal-oriented in a fragmentative sense, such as: "I don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election." This statement, coupled with the statistical correlation, suggests how a sense of struggle can align with fragmentative goal framing. Conversely, a perfect negative correlation ($r = -1.00$) exists between 'cohesive goals' and 'fear'. This implies that the presence of fear in discourse is inversely related to the promotion of integrative objectives. McCain's call for unity, "I urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together," showcases cohesive goals and a desire to mitigate fear through shared action.

**4. Tribal Dominance and Relational Dynamics:**

The analysis also touched upon 'tribal dominance' and its relationship with other dimensions. The statement "They are just very nice. But they're not," associated with a high 'tribal dominance' score and low 'individual dignity', exemplifies exclusionary framing by implicitly defining an out-group that does not share the positive attribute. In terms of relational climate, the phrase "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that" from McCain's speech, while aiming for amity, also signals a strong in-group identity, potentially contributing to rhetorical incoherence if not carefully managed.

**5. Methodological Considerations:**

The descriptive statistics highlight variability in the measurement of certain dimensions. 'Envy' showed significant variability (Std Dev = 0.49), while 'Compersion' had perfect consistency (Std Dev = 0.00). Similarly, 'Fear' had a higher standard deviation (0.35) compared to 'Hope' (0.18). This suggests that reliably quantifying envy and fear within political discourse may present greater challenges for the framework than measuring other dimensions.

### Conclusion

The application of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v7.3 to the analyzed speeches demonstrates the framework's capacity to identify complex rhetorical strategies and their interrelationships. The strong correlations between emotional appeals ('fear', 'hope') and orientations towards success ('envy', 'compersion') and goals ('fragmentative', 'cohesive') underscore how these dimensions are often intertwined in political discourse. The findings suggest that appeals to universal human dignity are inversely related to fear, while resentment and divisiveness are often linked with crisis mentality and fragmentative goals. However, the observed variability in the measurement of 'envy' and 'fear' indicates potential areas for methodological refinement to ensure consistent and reliable analysis of these critical dimensions. Future research could explore these correlations across a broader corpus to further validate these patterns and enhance the framework's precision.
