    "analysis_notes": "The document is a clear example of populist economic rhetoric, characterized by a strong 'us vs. them' narrative (the 99% vs. the oligarchs/1%). This results in high scores for dimensions related to conflict and division (Tribal Dominance, Envy, Enmity, Fragmentative Goals) and low scores for their counterparts (Individual Dignity, Compersion, Cohesive Goals). The speech blends high fear/threat framing with a concluding message of hope that is conditional on collective action."
