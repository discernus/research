It advocates for systems that reflect truth for everyone, rejecting essentialism and reduction of individuals to categories. The core message is that pluralism strengthens society without diminishing humanity, and justice cannot be partial. The document acknowledges past injustices but focuses on building fair, open, and future-focused systems. It stresses transparency, constructiveness, and universal application of rules over retribution. The author values intellectual honesty, challenging opposing views, and using data for problem-solving. Integrity means perseverance through clarity, not coercion. The authors see themselves as reformers, not revolutionaries, embracing incremental progress, trade-offs, and feasible steps to reduce suffering and expand opportunity. They acknowledge challenges but believe in human potential and resilience, advocating for continuous improvement of democratic institutions. Hope is seen as an invitation to contribute and build coalitions.\",\n        \"scores\": {\n          \"care\": 0.9,\n          \"harm\": 0.2,\n          \"fairness\": 0.9,\n          \"cheating\": 0.1,\n          \"loyalty\": 0.8,\n          \"betrayal\": 0.2,\n          \"authority\": 0.7,\n          \"subversion\": 0.3,\n          \"sanctity\": 0.8,\n          \"degradation\": 0.2,\n          \"liberty\": 0.9,\n          \"oppression\": 0.1\n        },\n        \"evidence\": {\n          \"care\": [\n            \"Every person deserves a voice, a chance, and the freedom to live with dignity.
