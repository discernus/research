{"experiment_summary": "This analysis plan is designed for the 'simple_character_validation' experiment. It will calculate descriptive statistics for all ten character dimensions to enable a descriptive comparison between the conservative and progressive speakers (H1). It will also generate a Pearson correlation matrix to analyze inter-dimensional relationships and assess the internal coherence of the framework's virtue-vice pairs, which serves as a proxy for MC-SCI reliability analysis (H2). The successful execution of this plan validates the architectural hypothesis (H3).", "tasks": {"descriptive_stats": {"tool": "descriptive_stats", "parameters": {"columns": ["dignity_score", "truth_score", "justice_score", "hope_score", "pragmatism_score", "tribalism_score", "manipulation_score", "resentment_score", "fear_score", "fantasy_score"]}, "purpose": "To calculate summary statistics for each character dimension. This provides the foundational data for H1 (Ideological Comparison) by allowing a descriptive comparison of character scores between the conservative (McCain) and progressive (Sanders) speakers."}, "correlations": {"tool": "pearson_correlation", "parameters": {"columns": ["dignity_score", "truth_score", "justice_score", "hope_score", "pragmatism_score", "tribalism_score", "manipulation_score", "resentment_score", "fear_score", "fantasy_score"]}, "purpose": "To generate a full correlation matrix of all character dimensions as required by the 'character_correlation_matrix' test.

This analysis examines the correlations between theoretically opposing virtue-vice pairs (e.g., Dignity vs. Tribalism) to validate the framework's ability to measure character tension, the basis for the MC-SCI."}}}
