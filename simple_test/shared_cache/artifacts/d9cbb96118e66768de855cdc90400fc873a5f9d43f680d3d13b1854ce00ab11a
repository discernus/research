  "raw_analysis_response": "I will decode the provided framework and documents.\nThen, I will apply the `analysis_prompt` from the framework to each document.\nFor each document, I will evaluate the ten dimensions: Tribal Dominance, Individual Dignity, Fear, Hope, Envy, Complacency, Enmity, Amity, Fragmentative Goals, and Cohesive Goals.\nFor each dimension, I will determine an intensity score (0.0-1.0) and a salience score (0.0-1.0).\nI will then calculate the ten corresponding tension scores using the formula: `Tension Score = min(Intensity, Salience) * abs(Intensity - Salience)`.\nAfter calculating all ten tension scores, I will compute the overall Strategic Contradiction Index (SCI) by averaging the ten tension scores.\nFinally, I will generate the two required CSV sections: `<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>` and `<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>`, adhering to the specified format and delimiters.\n\n**Analysis of Document 1: \"A Shared Future: Equity Through Dignity and Democratic Renewal\"**\n\n**Framework:** Cohesive Flourishing Framework v5.0\n\n**Document 1 Analysis:**\n\nThe document emphasizes individual dignity, equity, and inclusive systems. It acknowledges past injustices but focuses on building fair, open, and future-oriented systems. The text advocates for transparency, constructive approaches to inequality, and a commitment to human potential. It expresses a belief in progress through iterative improvement and adaptation, rather than radical upheaval. Hope is presented as a driving force for contribution and collaboration.\n\n**Dimension Scoring and Calculations:**\n\n**1. Identity Axis:**\n\n*   **Tribal Dominance:**\n    *   Intensity: 0.2 (The text acknowledges group experiences but rejects essentialism and reduction of people to categories, suggesting a low emphasis on tribal dominance.)\n    *   Salience: 0.3 (While not dominant, the acknowledgment of group experiences like race, gender, and class gives it some salience.)\n    *   Tension Score = min(0.2, 0.3) * abs(0.2 - 0.3) = 0.2 * 0.1 = **0.02**\n    *   Evidence: \"While we must acknowledge the lived experiences shaped by race, gender, and class, we reject essentialism and the reduction of people to categories.\"\n\n*   **Individual Dignity:**\n    *   Intensity: 0.9 (The core message revolves around every person deserving a voice, a chance, and the freedom to live with dignity.)\n    *   Salience: 0.9 (This is a central theme, consistently reinforced throughout the document.)\n    *   Tension Score = min(0.9, 0.9) * abs(0.9 - 0.9) = 0.9 * 0.0 = **0.00**\n    *   Evidence: \"Every person deserves a voice, a chance, and the freedom to live with dignity.\" and \"Each individual carries inherent dignity, grounded not in their background but in their capacity to think, act, and contribute to the common good.\"\n\n**2. Emotional Climate:**\n\n*   **Fear:**\n    *   Intensity: 0.3 (The document states, \"We do not fear facts; we seek them,\" and \"We meet uncertainty with resilience, not fear,\" indicating a conscious effort to manage or overcome fear.)\n    *   Salience: 0.2 (Fear is mentioned as something to be overcome, not a dominant emotion.)\n    *   Tension Score = min(0.3, 0.2) * abs(0.3 - 0.2) = 0.2 * 0.1 = **0.02**\n    *   Evidence: \"We do not fear facts; we seek them.\" and \"We meet uncertainty with resilience, not fear.\"\n\n*   **Hope:**\n    *   Intensity: 0.9 (Hope is presented as a fundamental belief in a better future achievable through human choice and action, driving contribution and collaboration.)\n    *   Salience: 0.9 (Hope is a pervasive and motivating theme throughout the text.)\n    *   Tension Score = min(0.9, 0.9) * abs(0.9 - 0.9) = 0.9 * 0.0 = **0.00**\n    *   Evidence: \"Hope does not deny hardship; it insists that hardship is not the end of the story.\" and \"We believe the future can be better\u2014not because of inevitability, but because people choose to make it so.\"\n\n**3. Success Orientation:**\n\n*   **Envy:**\n    *   Intensity: 0.1 (The text focuses on building systems that are fair for everyone and acknowledges the value of marginalized communities without expressing resentment towards others' success.)\n    *   Salience: 0.1 (Envy is not a prominent theme.)\n    *   Tension Score = min(0.1, 0.1) * abs(0.1 - 0.1) = 0.1 * 0.0 = **0.00**\n    *   Evidence: \"We measure fairness not by whether one group 'wins,' but by whether the rules are just and universally applied.\"\n\n*   **Complacency:**\n    *   Intensity: 0.2 (The document acknowledges flaws and injustices in systems, indicating a rejection of complacency and a drive for improvement.)\n    *   Salience: 0.2 (Complacency is implicitly rejected by the call for reform and progress.)\n    *   Tension Score = min(0.2, 0.2) * abs(0.2 - 0.2) = 0.2 * 0.0 = **0.00**\n    *   Evidence: \"We see the flaws in our systems, the pain in our communities, and the scale of our challenges.\"\n\n**4. Relational Climate:**\n\n*   **Enmity:**\n    *   Intensity: 0.1 (The document advocates for constructive approaches and building coalitions, not antagonism.)\n    *   Salience: 0.1 (Enmity is not a focus.)\n    *   Tension Score = min(0.1, 0.1) * abs(0.1 - 0.1) = 0.1 * 0.0 = **0.00**\n    *   Evidence: \"We pursue progress not by erasing our differences but by aligning around shared goals and a shared future.\"\n\n*   **Amity:**\n    *   Intensity: 0.8 (The text emphasizes building systems, coalitions, and pursuing progress through alignment around shared goals.)\n    *   Salience: 0.8 (Collaboration and building positive relationships are key to achieving the vision.)\n    *   Tension Score = min(0.8, 0.8) * abs(0.8 - 0.8) = 0.8 * 0.0 = **0.00**\n    *   Evidence: \"Hope invites all to contribute. It builds coalitions, not cults.\" and \"We pursue progress not by erasing our differences but by aligning around shared goals and a shared future.\"\n\n**5. Goal Orientation:**\n\n*   **Fragmentative Goals:**\n    *   Intensity: 0.2 (The document acknowledges differences but aims to align around shared goals, suggesting a low emphasis on fragmentative goals.)\n    *   Salience: 0.3 (While the aim is unity, the acknowledgment of diverse experiences gives some salience to potential fragmentation.)\n    *   Tension Score = min(0.2, 0.3) * abs(0.2 - 0.3) = 0.2 * 0.1 = **0.02**\n    *   Evidence: \"We pursue progress not by erasing our differences but by aligning around shared goals and a shared future.\"\n\n*   **Cohesive Goals:**\n    *   Intensity: 0.9 (The vision is about building inclusive systems, a shared future, and aligning around common objectives.)\n    *   Salience: 0.9 (This is the overarching objective of the document.)\n    *   Tension Score = min(0.9, 0.9) * abs(0.9 - 0.9) = 0.9 * 0.0 = **0.00**\n    *   Evidence: \"Our work is to build systems that reflect that truth\u2014for everyone.\" and \"Our vision is inclusive because justice cannot be partial.\"\n\n**Tension Scores Summary:**\n\n*   Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity: 0.02\n*   Fear vs. Hope: 0.02\n*   Envy vs. Complacency: 0.00\n*   Enmity vs. Amity: 0.00\n*   Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals: 0.02\n\n**Strategic Contradiction Index (SCI) Calculation:**\n\nSCI = (0.02 + 0.02 + 0.00 + 0.00 + 0.02) / 5\nSCI = 0.06 / 5\n**SCI = 0.012**\n\n**Salience Ranking:**\n\n1.  Individual Dignity: 0.9\n2.  Hope: 0.9\n3.  Cohesive Goals: 0.9\n4.  Amity: 0.8\n5.  Tribal Dominance: 0.3\n6.  Fragmentative Goals: 0.3\n7.  Fear: 0.2\n8.  Envy: 0.1\n9.  Complacency: 0.2\n10. Enmity: 0.1\n\n*Note: Complacency and Fear have the same salience score of 0.2. Envy and Enmity have the same salience score of 0.1. The ranking reflects the order in which they appear in the list if scores are equal.*\n\n**Revised Salience Ranking (ordered):**\n\n1.  Individual Dignity: 0.9\n2.  Hope: 0.9\n3.  Cohesive Goals: 0.9\n4.  Amity: 0.8\n5.  Tribal Dominance: 0.3\n6.  Fragmentative Goals: 0.3\n7.  Complacency: 0.2\n8.  Fear: 0.2\n9.  Enmity: 0.1\n10. Envy: 0.1\n\n**Final Scores and Evidence:**\n\n```\n<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\naid,tribal_dominance_intensity,tribal_dominance_salience,individual_dignity_intensity,individual_dignity_salience,fear_intensity,fear_salience,hope_intensity,hope_salience,envy_intensity,envy_salience,complacency_intensity,complacency_salience,enmity_intensity,enmity_salience,amity_intensity,amity_salience,fragmentative_goals_intensity,fragmentative_goals_salience,cohesive_goals_intensity,cohesive_goals_salience,tribal_dominance_vs_individual_dignity_tension,fear_vs_hope_tension,envy_vs_complacency_tension,enmity_vs_amity_tension,fragmentative_goals_vs_cohesive_goals_tension,strategic_contradiction_index\n{artifact_id},0.2,0.3,0.9,0.9,0.3,0.2,0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.1,0.8,0.8,0.2,0.3,0.9,0.9,0.02,0.02,0.00,0.00,0.02,0.012\n<<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>\naid,dimension,intensity,salience,evidence,tension_score\n{artifact_id},tribal_dominance,0.2,0.3,\"While we must acknowledge the lived experiences shaped by race, gender, and class, we reject essentialism and the reduction of people to categories.\",0.02\n{artifact_id},individual_dignity,0.9,0.9,\"Every person deserves a voice, a chance, and the freedom to live with dignity.
