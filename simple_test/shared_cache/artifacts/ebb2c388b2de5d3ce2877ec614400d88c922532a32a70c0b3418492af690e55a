# Moral Foundations Theory Framework v5.0

**Version**: 5.0  
**Status**: Active  
**Major Change**: Embedded CSV Architecture for Synthesis Scalability

A Discernus framework is a self-contained markdown file that embodies the core principles of computational social science research. It serves as both human-readable methodology and machine-executable instructions, ensuring perfect coherence between theory and practice.

**ðŸš€ NEW IN V5.0: Embedded CSV Output Contract**

Version 5.0 introduces the **Embedded CSV Architecture** to solve synthesis scalability bottlenecks. Frameworks must now embed standardized CSV segments directly in their LLM responses using Discernus-specific delimiters, enabling processing of 3,000-8,000 documents per synthesis run (a 60-800x improvement over current academic practice).

## Moral Foundations Theory Core Analysis

### **Six Foundation Pairs: Independent Scoring with Tension Analysis**

**Individualizing Foundations (Foundation Pairs 1-2)**:
1. **Care** (0.0-1.0): Compassion, protection, suffering prevention
2. **Harm** (0.0-1.0): Cruelty concern, violence prevention, victim advocacy

3. **Fairness** (0.0-1.0): Justice, equality, proportional treatment  
4. **Cheating** (0.0-1.0): Unfairness concern, exploitation prevention, corruption focus

**Binding Foundations (Foundation Pairs 3-5)**:
5. **Loyalty** (0.0-1.0): Group cohesion, fidelity, solidarity
6. **Betrayal** (0.0-1.0): Group abandonment concern, treachery prevention

7. **Authority** (0.0-1.0): Hierarchy respect, tradition, legitimate order
8. **Subversion** (0.0-1.0): Rebellion concern, tradition undermining, hierarchy disruption

9. **Sanctity** (0.0-1.0): Sacred preservation, purity, transcendence  
10. **Degradation** (0.0-1.0): Contamination concern, profane prevention, sacred violation

**Liberty Foundation (Foundation Pair 6)**:
11. **Liberty** (0.0-1.0): Freedom, autonomy, self-determination
12. **Oppression** (0.0-1.0): Control concern, domination prevention, freedom protection

## Revolutionary Moral Tension Mathematics

### **Moral Foundation Tension Scoring**

**Formula**: `Moral Tension = min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) Ã— |Foundation_salience - Opposition_salience|`

### **Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)**

**Formula**: `MSCI = (Sum of all Moral Tension Scores) / Number of Foundation Pairs`

Phase 2: Framework Methodology: Your task is to analyze the text using the Moral Foundations Theory Framework v5.0, which includes tension-enhanced salience-weighted analysis. Phase 3: Operational Definitions: The framework evaluates 6 foundation pairs (12 total foundations): Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, and Liberty/Oppression. Phase 4: Scoring Protocol: For each of the 12 foundations, score its intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience (0.0-1.0). Provide the strongest 1-2 quotes as evidence. Then, calculate the moral tension for each of the 6 pairs and the overall Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI). Phase 5: Framework-Specific CSV Structure: Your scores CSV must contain exactly 27 columns in this order: aid, care, harm, fairness, cheating, loyalty, betrayal, authority, subversion, sanctity, degradation, liberty, oppression, care_salience, harm_salience, fairness_salience, cheating_salience, loyalty_salience, betrayal_salience, authority_salience, subversion_salience, sanctity_salience, degradation_salience, liberty_salience, oppression_salience, care_harm_tension, fairness_cheating_tension, loyalty_betrayal_tension, authority_subversion_tension, sanctity_degradation_tension, liberty_oppression_tension, moral_strategic_contradiction_index. Your evidence CSV must contain exactly 6 columns: aid, foundation, quote_id, quote_text, confidence_score, context_type. Phase 6: Output Specification: Return a complete response containing both a comprehensive JSON analysis AND the embedded CSV segments using the exact delimiters and column structures specified in the output_contract."
