# Political Speech - Speaker H

**Context**: Economic policy speech from 2020s

We are witnessing an oligarchy in America. And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price. And our political system is ill-prepared for this abuse of power. In fact, much of our political system enables it, starting with the role of money in politics.

The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country and they derive their power from dividing working people apart. They specialize in getting us to turn on one another and they get us to turn on one another along lines of left and right, race and gender, creed and culture. They'll throw out every label and judgment and cultural debate in the book to keep us distracted because the last thing they want us to realize is that the division that is actually hurting our country the most is how endless greed is costing the lives of everyone else.

They want us to think that our lives are suffering because of the LGBT kid down the street or because of the mixed status family or the dreamer down the block who's just trying to make a better life for themselves. But we're smarter than that Greeley. We know better than that.

And I understand that this kind of disdain that the wealthiest, wealthiest people in this country have for the working class doesn't just come from them not being raised right. It's shorthand for the right wing's entire political agenda and a certain ugly kind of politics, a politics that involves lying to and screwing over working and middle class Americans so that they can steal from our healthcare, Social Security, and veterans' benefits to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest and bailouts for their crypto billionaire friends. And Greeley, there's a word for this kind of thing, corruption.

Donald Trump does see the immense pressure that working people are under. But his answer is an America that operates on the principle of every man for himself, divide and conquer. And now that Trump is back in power, we see it clear as day. He's handed the keys to Elon Musk and is selling off our country for parts to the wealthiest people in the world for a kickback. And in exchange, those billionaires and oligarchs will back his campaigns and bankroll those of his allies. They scratch his back and he scratches theirs. And all of us are left behind.

And the clever thing that these guys sell is making working people like you and me believe that we're just one step outside from that club, that we're just a little bit out from being able to be a billionaire too. Any billionaires in this room? I didn't think so.

Now it's this idea that if we just work hard, we too can have nation-state level money, except these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me.

Just look at what Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing to our healthcare, our veterans' benefits, and Social Security. They are slashing programs that we and you have spent a lifetime paying into. And by the way, not them, because those billionaires haven't paid their fair share of taxes in years.

And let's talk about Medicaid and Medicare for a second because your representative, Dave Evans, you know that guy that hasn't been showing up for the last couple months? Maybe he hasn't been showing up because he voted to cut Medicaid.

In fact, every single House Republican voted to cut Medicaid and they'll tell you, "No, I didn't. I didn't say that," but here's what it is. They voted on a budget that cuts $880 billion from the committee that's in charge of Medicaid. And so now they're trying to play a game and say, "We didn't do that," because they did by proxy. So let's set the record straight.

Mass media and Fox News, and the right well have you believe that these American values are something out of the Communist Manifesto. They believe that we think these things, because we went to some fancy college and read them in a book somewhere. But I'll tell you, I don't believe in healthcare, labor and human dignity, because I'm an extremist or a Marxist. I believe it because I was a waitress, because I've scrubbed toilets with my mom to afford school, because I've worked double shifts to keep the lights on, because I lost my dad to cancer as a kid and had to see my mom open hospital bills in the days after. And I don't want us to live like this anymore, Greeley.

This isn't just about Republicans. We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us too. But, Greeley, that means our communities choosing and voting for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.

You know which Coloradans did vote to gut Medicaid and jack up healthcare costs? Gabe Evans and Lauren Boebert right next door. So folks, you know what that means, right? We need to come together and spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors, and give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat who will stand for Colorado.

So to all of those who came here today, unsure of whether this is where you belong, I want to tell you that you do. You do. Honestly, no matter who you voted for in the past. No matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender identity, or status, no matter if you disagree with me on a couple of things. If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here.

If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here. But I will say this, those leaders on either side of the aisle who are willing to put their fellow Americans down, so that they can get ahead or feel better about themselves, those folks may best find a home somewhere else. Because in this house, we stand together, we know that, that it's our only choice because we know that without exception, if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win.

So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity.

It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, "Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect."

# Political Speech - Speaker G

**Context**: Economic policy speech from 2020s

The American people are outraged at what's going on, and the American people are saying loud and clear, "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society. We will not accept the richest guy in the world running all over Washington, making cuts to the Social Security Administration, cuts to the Veterans Administration, almost destroying the Department of Education, all so that they could give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1%."

Today you have more concentration of ownership in America than we have ever had in the history of this country in sector after sector, whether it is agriculture, transportation, media, financial services, what you have is a small number of extraordinarily large corporations who charge us outrageous prices for the products that we have to buy.

Today you've got three Wall Street firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. Combined, these three investment firms are the majority stockholders in 95% of American corporations. These guys, I want to tell you something because I bump into them in my line of work, they are not nice guys. I know on TV they come across... And in your community, they make a donation to the hospital or the Boys & Girls Clubs or the food shelf. They're just very nice. But they're not.

In America today, as I think all of you know, sadly and tragically, and we've got to deal with it, we have major epidemics dealing with addiction. I think we lost a hundred thousand Americans last year because of drug overdose. It's a serious problem in my state. We have people addicted to alcohol, serious problems with alcoholism. We have people who were addicted to tobacco. My father smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and he died before he was 60. People addicted to food. But I will tell you this, in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs.

Now everybody wants to do well in life. Everybody wants to make money. But you would think that if you had a few billion dollars or $10 or $20 billion, you would not feel obliged to step on the backs of poor people to become even richer. But that is exactly what they are doing right now. They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer.

These guys have no sense of what goes on in the real world. They live in another planet. They own mansions all over the world. They go on vacations to their own private islands. When they want to go someplace, they don't go into their car. They go into the planes or the helicopters that they own. Send their kids to the best private schools and colleges. That is their world.

Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires.

And what these guys are busy doing right now is going after Medicaid, going after Social Security, going after nutrition. The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on.

You know why the American people are angry and they are angry all over this country? They are angry because, believe it or not, despite a huge increase in worker productivity over the last 52 years, if you could believe it, real inflation accounted for wages today are lower than they were 52 years ago. Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change.

You got a President Trump getting inaugurated. And I must tell you one of the more bizarre experiences of my life was I was kind of pushed into the front row of that. And there I am, there's Trump, and right behind him, you got Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg, three wealthiest guys in the country. And then behind them, you got 13 other billionaires who Trump nominated to head up various government agencies.

I don't care if you are a Republican, Democrat, or independent, I don't think there's anybody who thinks it vaguely makes sense that the richest guy in the world could spend $270 million to get Trump elected and then become the most powerful person in the government. That's not just Republicans. Let's be clear. Billionaires are funding the Democratic Party and preventing that party from standing up for working families.

I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%. So if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve.

# Political Speech - Speaker A

**Context**: Electoral speech from 2000s

Thank you, thank you my friends. Thank you for coming here on this beautiful Arizona evening. [Applause] 

My friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Senator Barack Obama to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.

In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.

This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. Senator Obama believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.

A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States. [Applause]

Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.

Senator Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.

I urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.

Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that. [Applause]

It is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.

I am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.

I'm especially grateful to my wife Cindy, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.

You know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.

I am also, of course, very thankful to Governor Sarah Palin - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her husband Todd and their five beautiful children, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to Alaska, the Republican Party, and our country.

To all my campaign comrades, from Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.

I don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.

This campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that Senator Obama and my old friend Senator Joe Biden should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.

[Please, please] I would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of Arizona for it.

Tonight - tonight more than any night - I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or Senator Obama. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president, and I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America.

Because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.

Thank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.

[Applause]

# Political Speech - Speaker F

**Context**: Legislative floor speech from 2010s


Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my privilege to have the opportunity to address you here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. I have listened to a lot of discussion here with which I disagree, of course, and uh, but I keep hearing this term, "do your job, do your job." It seems to echo out of the left constantly, "do your job." And uh, the argument is that one of the arguments is that the President of the United States has a constitutional right to nominate to the Supreme Court. Well, he does, that's pretty clear in the Constitution. However, the Senate determines what advice is and the Senate determines that which is consent. And no nomination to the federal court can move forward without the Senate's advice and consent. It's the Senate's job then to evaluate the nominations of the President. And they can do so with or without hearings, with or without interviews. The Senate writes its own rules just like the House writes its own rules, Mr. Speaker. And so I'd like to put this back in perspective here. We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that the Constitution means what they want it to mean and they want to read it uh to say what they want it to say rather than what it actually says and rather than what it actually was understood to mean at the time of its ratification. And when you have justices to the Supreme Court that, that embody that belief and act on that belief, then we here who take an oath to support and defend the Constitution—and that's actually all of us here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, and everyone in the United States Senate for that matter—we recognize that if we're going to support and defend the Constitution, encouraging the, the nomination and the advice and the consent, the confirmation of the Senate and encouraging then a presidential appointment to the Supreme Court of someone whom the President is incapable of nominating anyone to the Supreme Court that what the Constitution says and what was understood to mean at the time of its ratification, he's demonstrated that in the past with his appointments to the court. He will demonstrate that again. We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend. And so our obligation then is to say, "Mr. President, you're lame duck. Let's stick with the tradition. Let's stick with the practice. Let's stick with the statements that have been made by a number of Democrats in the past when the shoe was on the other foot. People like Joe Biden and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer all would agree with Senator Chuck Grassley. No hearing, no, no confirmation in the Senate, no vote in the in the Judiciary Committee, and no vote on the floor of the Senate for this lame duck President's appointments because we have a Constitution that's got to be restored. And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment.

We were sitting with a deadlocked court that sat four and a half to four and a half out of a nine-member court. And you could kind of toss a coin on whether you would get a decision that came down on what the Constitution said and what the law said or what they preferred the policy was. An example of that. Got a couple of bad examples. This is even with the Stellar Justice Scalia sitting on the bench not even a year ago, June 24th and June 25th. On the 24th of June, the court came down with a decision King versus Burwell where the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court decided that he could write words into Obamacare that didn't exist. They were not passed by this Congress, not by either chamber of this Congress. As a matter of fact, it wasn't a phrase that was, that was conferenced out or something that was contested. It never was in the bill. The phrase that said, "or federal government." And that's the, that's the component that had it been in Obamacare, then the federal government could have gone into the states and established the exchanges in the states that ref establish exchanges to comply with the suggestion that came from this Congress, by the way, that came from this Congress by hook, by crook, by legislative shenanigan, just to quote some Democrats that lamented at the methodology they had to go through to push Obamacare down the throats of the American people. But in any case, the law never said and never, never enabled the federal government to establish exchanges in the states. And the Constitution doesn't allow that authority, in my opinion. There's no enumerated power for the federal government to to create exchanges for, for insurance health insurance policies within the states. But the Supreme Court ruled with the majority opinion written by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, but they could add words into the Obamacare where it says, "the states may establish exchanges." They, they added, "the states or federal government may establish exchanges." They made it up. And they wrapped themselves in the cloak of constitutional authority in Marberry versus Madison and a whole series of presumably precedent cases along the line. And that was June 24th on Thursday and it would kick the breath out of your gut to hear that if you're a constitutionist. And it bring you to a sad state of mourn. And you'd lay your head down on the pillow at night having trouble to sleep, thinking, "What am I going to do tomorrow? I couldn't react today. What am I going to do tomorrow? Lord, wake me up with an idea on how to, how to preserve our Constitution," if the Supreme Court of the United States believes that they can write law. When here in our Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Article one of our Constitution says, "All legislative power, power, all legislative, all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States." That's here. The House and the Senate. Article one, first words of our Constitution, all legislative powers. But the Supreme Court, wrapped in the cloak of Marbury versus Madison and their imagination of what precedents and star decisis might mean to them, decides that they can write words into the law. A Supreme Court writing law. And then the next morning, that morning that I was hopeful that I would wake up with an idea and how to address the Supreme Court that's overreached, here came the next decision, my time DC time, and that was decision of Obergfell where the Supreme Court created a new command in the Constitution. Not just discovered a right that never existed. They manufactured a command. There's no right in the Constitution for a same-sex marriage. There's no reference in there at all. There's not one single Founding Father that would have ever accepted an idea that they had, they had founded a nation and embodied within our declaration or our ratified Constitution or the subsequent amendments that there was some right, let alone a command, same-sex marriage. It's a complete manufactured, not just a right, but a command by the Supreme Court of the United States. And I have some history with this. The Supreme Court of the state of Iowa did the same thing to Iowans in 2009. I sat in the legislature and was an author of the Defense of Marriage Act in about 1998. And one of the pieces of the debate was, "Why do we need to bother to do this?" Yes, it would make sense if marriage were threatened, but it was so far beyond the pale that why would we bother to do this? Well, we saw litigation coming in Hawaii at that period of time that was trying to force same-sex marriage on America. We wrote and, and I was, I, as one of the authors of it, wrote the Defense of Marriage Act, put it into Iowa law. And so from 1998, 11 years later, the Supreme Court of the United, or excuse, Supreme Court of the state of Iowa created a for same-sex marriage in Iowa. And Iowans rose up and threw three of them off the bench the following election in November of 2010. Not because of the policy decision, but because they had not kept their oath of office to support and defend the Constitution. They're obligated to read and understand and believe the Constitution and then issue their judgments based upon the law, the text of the law, and as an ancillary component of this, the intent of the legislature itself. Because after all, the legislature is the voice of the people. The judges are not. They're unelected. They're appointed for life. They're unaccountable. And so there it was. June 25th of 2015 on Friday, the Supreme Court manufactured a command for same-sex marriage. Now this is appalling to me, Mr. Speaker, because I can read this Constitution and understand what it means. And I can read the precedent cases along the way that have flowed from Marberry on down to today. But it's no longer possible to look at this Supreme Court and discern what a likely decision of the Court might be by studying the text of the Constitution and the text of the law because we have a court that will write, make it up as they go along, write laws. They go and discover what they would call a new right in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, equal protection under the law. There is equal protection already. There's long been equal protection that was about making sure that babies that were born to the newly free slave post Civil War would be American citizens and they would enjoy all of the rights and all the priv of being a citizen, a person that enjoyed personhood in good standing. That's what the 13th, 13th Amendment ended slavery and the 14th Amendment guaranteed equal rights. And now this court has twisted it into a command that there's not a difference between a man and a woman when it comes to joining them together in matrimony. Well, there is a difference. And it's been husband and wife in every one of these states until such time as the activists got busy. Those are the kind of things that if the states want to establish same-sex marriage, so be it. That's a voice of the people. It's constitutional and it fits the structure of our our United States Constitution along with the various state constitutions and the structure of the rule of law. But if a court wants to manufacture a new right, let alone a new command, that's wrong. And this Congress ought to speak up and we need a president that will appoint justices to the Supreme Court that will rule on the text of the Constitution, its original meaning, and on the understanding of what the text of that Constitution says.

So I would back up to the King versus Burwell decision, Mr. Speaker, and add this, uh, for the benefit of those folks that are listening in, and maybe there is some staff of the Supreme Court that are listening. If you discover a law, if it's a, if it's a law like Obamacare that comes before the Supreme Court and you read the text of that and it doesn't include "or federal government," and you believe that Congress wanted the federal government to be able to establish the exchanges or intended to write that into the law, you don't get to just write it in and say that's what they really meant. You have to remand it back to Congress and tell us this is what the law says. So therefore, if Congress wants the law to say something different, we have to amend it here in the House and the Senate and get a presidential signature on it. That is the constitutional structure of this government that we have, Mr. Speaker, and it's, it's a bit um, frustrating for me to listen to the dialogue otherwise that the Senate's not doing their job because they withhold a confirmation, uh, that of a presidential appointment when we have a president that has proven that he's not going to put up an appointment that will protect our Constitution. This is the time we must defend our Constitution and we must nominate and elect a president of the United States who will make those appointments to the Supreme Court who believe the Constitution means what it says.

But Mr. Speaker, I didn't actually come here to talk about that. Um, that's my rebuttal to what I've listened to for the last 40 minutes or so. I came here to talk about the rule of law for sure. And part of this is stimulated by an immigration hearing that we had yesterday in the subcommittee, House Judiciary. This is a type of hearing that I have listened to too many times, one of the hardest hearings that I have sat through in my time here in this Congress, Mr. Speaker. This was a hearing that had witnesses, um, a fine Sheriff Jenkins from Frederick County, Maryland, who has been enforcing immigration law, standing up for the rule of law. He's been prudently using the legal and justifiable, uh, evidence that he had before him, and he's been criticized for his effectiveness by the people that don't want to enforce the law. It's a good witness, uh, Sheriff Jenkins. But additionally there also we had, we had witnesses from two families that were suffering tragically. One of them was a mother of Joshua Wilkerson, her name is Laura Wilkerson. She's testified before the Judiciary Committee in the past at least once, and I have met her at an immigration event in Richmond, Virginia on another occasion and listen to the tragic, tragic story of her son Joshua, who was, um, essentially abducted from his school at, um, as about a sophomore in high school or so and hauled out into outside of town where he was beaten mercilessly and bludgeoned and finally murdered and had and then the perpetrator, an illegal alien whom the law enforcement had encountered and released onto the streets of America, who had no business being in America in the first place, and whom law enforcement already had picked up at least once. This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body. He hauled his body out and and put gas and poured gasoline on it and burned this Joshua Wilkerson's body and then he went and took a shower and went to a movie as if it was just another day in the life of. Well, Mr. Speaker, it was another day in, in the life of America and Americans. It's another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here, one who had been encountered by law enforcement officers in the past, one whom I believe ICE declined, uh, to pick up and place into removal proceedings. This happens every day in this country. It happens hundreds of times in this country each year. These incidents of illegal aliens that are, that are arrested and turned loose on the street because the President has this idea of prioritization or prosecutorial discretion is costing lives in America. And it's costing, it's costing in the end thousands of lives in America. And the sad, sad story told by Laura Wilkerson yesterday that she has the courage and the heart to come here and share her story with us and to place that awful, brutal, ghastly memory again into her mind's eye and pour that forth into the Congressional Record so that some of us, some of us will soak that up and be mobilized to do something, something more to resist the President's policy of amnesty, de facto amnesty, amnesty by executive edict, that has been part and parcel of the Obama policy since the beginning of his time here in office. And it's been getting worse and worse every month. I thank God for Laura Wilkerson and I ask God to bless the life and the memory and the soul of Joshua Wilkerson who has paid a tremendously high price because we have an ideological president who, I'd say to the other side of the aisle, who's not doing his job. In fact, he's ordering law enforcement officers not to do their job. Federal law requires that when immigration law enforcement officers encounter an individual is unlawfully present in the United States, quote, "he shall be placed in removable proceedings," close quote. That's the law. And our, and our Border Patrol officers included are told, "If you're here to enforce the law and you're determined to do so, you're better get yourself another job." They've become the Welcome Wagon on the southern border. And now most anybody that crosses that border and makes it across the Rio Grande River, across the land border that stretches from Texas all the way, uh, across through New Mexico, Arizona, and California to the Pacific Ocean. Most anybody that gets across there knows, "If you just claim asylum, uh, you can be, you can be a refugee and this federal government will roll out the Welcome Wagon." Former member of Congress, Michelle Bachman, and I stood on the, on the banks of the Rio Grande River at Roma, Texas, here a summer and a half or so ago and watched as they inflated a raft on the, the other side of the river. Two coyotes, fairly good-sized raft. And they helped the lady into that raft Sunday afternoon, broad daylight, exactly at the shift change for the Border Patrol. And they helped a pregnant lady into the raft. She had two little bags of for property. And they raft across the river, brought it up to the shoreline under the eyes of the city police and the Border Patrol. But it was shift change and they helped one of the coyotes got out of the raft. The other one stabilized it, helped the pregnant lady out of the raft onto the, onto US shores. And then handed her two little diddy bags and he got back into the raft and the two coyotes went back across the river, deflated the raft, folded it up, put it in the trunk of their car, the car that we'd watched go around and around over there knowing that it was a coyote car because they recognized it from the US side of the river. And a lady stood there, she and her unborn baby in her two diddy bags, waiting for the Border Patrol to show up. Takes a little longer during the shift change. They show up, no doubt. And I didn't follow this case any further. And they would have preferred that I didn't. But here's what I will predict happened. That she applied for asylum. The baby is now born. And the baby is an American citizen. And she is the parent of an anchor baby. Well, that's the kind of person that Barack Obama has granted a de facto, at least a temporary amnesty to for the deferred action for parents of. I keep wanting to tell you what that word means to me. Um, but, but the, um, parents, the parents of Americans is what the President would like to call it. Deferred action for parents of Americans, DAPA. Well, here's. I watched one of those parents of Americans, parent now come across the border in a, in an inflatable raft with two coyotes. They got paid something to do that, that I don't know how much. And now the edict that we grant this de facto permit, this amnesty for the parents of, of anchor babies to be staying free in the United States, that suspends the rule of law, def law, defies the very law, the specified law itself. And that case is heard before the Supreme Court this week, uh, Mr. Speaker. And the question is, does the President have prosecutorial authority, prosecutorial discretion? That, well, the precedence along prosecutorial discretion. And I don't know. The Supreme Court has ever heard and ruled on a case of prosecutorial discretion. I believe they have not. But the precedents that are out there in the lower courts and the practice has been that if a chief executive officer and and can project his policy through his subordinates that they have to pick and choose which cases they will prosecute. Well, when they do that, that's called prosecutorial discretion. It has to be on an individual basis only. And that's by the words of the former Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, who testified before the Judiciary Committee to that extent. And in the first Morton memo that brought out this prosecutorial discretion, it creates four different categories or groups of people. So they're utilizing categories or groups of people declaring it to be prosecutorial discretion when in fact it is not prosecutorial discretion because it applies to groups of people created four different groups of people. That's the story of Joshua Wilkerson. And then the witness sitting next to Laura Wilkerson is Michelle Rut Modale, Iowa. Michelle Rut, the grieving mother of a daughter, 21 years old, who was a 4.0 student at Belleview University. She wanted to become a law enforcement investigator. She had the best grades that you could possibly have, living and loving life. She had graduated and enjoyed the graduation ceremonies the day before when an illegal criminal alien drunk driving perpetrator ran her down and rear-ended her in the street and killed Sarah Root. Sarah, Sarah Root, 4.0 student, the world ahead of her, wanting to contribute to this country, to life, to society, living and loving life. Her life abruptly ended by a criminal alien who had been, and who had been encountered by a law enforcement before, whose immigration attorneys knew him. Two of them have been quoted in the newspaper at this point. And he had been released. He'd been released onto the streets where he now had three times the blood alcohol content allowable by law, drag racing in the streets, killed Sarah Root. And her mother Michelle told the story yesterday of her, of her daughter whom she loves so deeply. And all through the rest of her life and her family's life, they will carry this hole, this ache in their heart that didn't need to be. Sarah Root would be alive today if the President had done his job, if law enforcement had been allowed to do their job, if ICE had responded when local law enforcement called them. And if ICE and, and on top of that, sometimes it's ICE issues a detainer and local law enforcement releases them from a sanctuary city. This is mixed up both ways. We got ICE who's prohibited from doing their job, who sometimes won't when they want to. Local law enforcement that won't cooperate with ICE because I sent out a letter a year and a half or so ago that said ICE detainers are a recommendation. They're no longer mandatory. Congress passed the law and directed the Department of Homeland Security to establish the rule that would have the force and effective law that ICE detainers are mandatory. They wrote the rule that ICE detainers are mandatory. And Dan Ragsdale, the interim director of ICE, issued a letter that said to all local law enforcement, "No, it's a recommendation. It's not mandatory." And now we have in this confused junk. Arizona, here's Texas. You've got it in the heart of the heartland. Though that's col, that's Colorado over along the East Coast. Something has happened in most of the states and this is because of the prosecutorial discretion. This President has, has released, his administration has released over 30,000 criminals, criminal aliens onto the streets of America. And of those that they released, there have been at least 124 of them who have been charged with homicide for 135 murders. That's 135 dead Americans that would be alive today if the President didn't have the policy of releasing criminal, criminal aliens onto the streets. That's, that's the ones we know of. That's the ones that are the recidivism within a five-year window of time whose names we know, whose incidents we know. But that doesn't include anywhere near all of them, Mr. Speaker. This is a local, this is the face of one of these perpetrators, Mauricio Hernandez. What did he do? Mauricio Hernandez, a sexual predator who impregnated a 13-year-old daughter of his living girlfriend. And took this repeatedly, had sexual relations with her in ways that I won't repeat here on the floor. Took her off to soccer games where he gave. He also gave her an abortion inducing drug. And she went into into a porta pot and had the baby that was alive. And he went in and saw that baby. And this girl was then hauled home. The baby was left to die. That baby died. Mauricio Hernandez is the perpetrator. He's another illegal alien. Another one who had been encountered by law. Another one that had been granted this de facto amnesty because of the President's policy. And so I can stand here, Mr. Speaker, every night I could come here and give you these stats and I can give you the data on the thousands of Americans that are dead at the hands of the criminal aliens that have been incarcerated for a temporary period of time and released by multiple jurisdictions across this country. And every American that dies at their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our laws. That's what's at stake here. But we're going to have to personalize it because people over on this side of the aisle have their fingers in their ears on data. But when they see the faces, when they hear the anguish and the voices, especially of the mothers, or the voice. And I'll conclude with this, Mr. Speaker, or the voice of the father, Scott Root, who said when they arrested this perpetrator that killed his daughter, he was out before they could bury his daughter. He was out on $5,000 bail, which was less than it cost him to bury his daughter. And that individual absconded back out of the United States, now not to be reached again by the arm of the law, which is not long enough because they put him out on bail. I don't want to see any more bail to criminal aliens. I want to see law enforcement. And I want an expectation that when the law is broken in the United States, that there's going to be an enforcement, that it'll be applied equally without regard to any of these categories that the President encourages us to be members of. That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally. Secure our borders. Restore their respect for the rule of law. Save these lives. Send these people into prison. And when they're done, send them back to the country that they can live in legally for the rest of their lives if they don't stay in our prisons for the rest of their lives. Mr. Speaker, this is an infuriating topic that America needs to know a lot more about. And I'd ask Mr. Speaker that this country keep the families of these victims in their prayers every day until such time as we rest.
