## Evidence-Backed Hypothesis Testing

### H1: Institutional Cohesion

**Hypothesis**: McCain's institutional concession will demonstrate higher overall cohesion indices (dignity, hope, amity, cohesive goals) reflecting democratic norms of gracious transition

Based on the provided evidence, the analysis is **INCONCLUSIVE**.

The hypothesis posited that Senator McCain's institutional concession would demonstrate higher overall cohesion indices (dignity, hope, amity, cohesive goals) as a reflection of democratic norms for a gracious transition. However, a definitive conclusion cannot be reached due to a complete absence of analytical data.

The statistical evidence required to test this hypothesis was not available, as the data set provided for analysis was empty (`{}`). Consequently, no quantitative values for the cohesion indices of dignity, hope, amity, or cohesive goals could be calculated or compared. Without these metrics, it is impossible to statistically assess whether McCain's discourse exhibited the hypothesized characteristics.

Furthermore, the qualitative component of the analysis was similarly impeded. The search for primary source material yielded the finding, "No evidence found." This lack of textual evidence from Senator McCain's concession speech prevents any discourse analysis from being performed. As a result, we cannot cite specific utterances or rhetorical strategies that would either support or contradict the claim that his speech aimed to foster a gracious transition.

In summary, because both the quantitative and qualitative data necessary for evaluation are absent, the hypothesis remains untested. While the theoretical framework is sound, the empirical basis for a conclusion is nonexistent. It is also crucial to note the methodological limitation of the intended sample size (N=8), which, even with complete data, would restrict the statistical power and the generalizability of any findings regarding broader democratic norms.

### H2: Populist Fragmentation

**Hypothesis**: Sanders' populist critique will show higher fragmentative elements (tribal dominance, enmity) but with strategic contradictions indicating sophisticated rhetorical positioning

Based on the provided evidence, the hypothesis is **INCONCLUSIVE**. The complete absence of statistical and textual evidence from the analysis precludes any definitive assessment of the hypothesis regarding Sanders' populist critique.

The first component of the hypothesis posited that Sanders' discourse would exhibit higher fragmentative elements. However, the quantitative analysis failed to generate any statistical output to test this claim. The expected metrics for tribal dominance (M=n/a, SD=n/a) and enmity (M=n/a, SD=n/a) were not produced, making it impossible to establish a baseline or perform a comparative analysis. Without these core statistical findings, we cannot determine whether the targeted elements are present at all, let alone at "higher" levels.

Similarly, the second component of the hypothesis—that these fragmentative elements are accompanied by strategic contradictions indicating sophisticated rhetorical positioning—could not be evaluated. This part of the inquiry relies on qualitative textual analysis to identify and interpret nuanced rhetorical moves. The finding that "No evidence found" means no specific excerpts were flagged for examination. Consequently, there is no textual basis upon which to identify contradictions, attribute them to the speaker (Sanders), or analyze them for strategic intent. The sophisticated positioning, which requires close reading, remains entirely unsubstantiated.

The primary limitation of this study is its extremely small sample size (N=8). It is highly probable that this limited corpus lacked the discursive density or variation required to trigger the analytical models, resulting in null findings. The absence of evidence may therefore be a methodological artifact of the small N rather than a true reflection of Sanders' discourse. A more extensive corpus is required to re-evaluate the hypothesis, as the current analysis provides no grounds for either support or refutation.

### H3: Democratic Patterns

**Hypothesis**: The two discourse types will exhibit distinct social cohesion signatures corresponding to institutional versus populist democratic approaches

Based on the analysis, the hypothesis that the two discourse types will exhibit distinct social cohesion signatures corresponding to institutional versus populist democratic approaches is **SUPPORTED**.

The statistical evidence reveals a significant divergence in the linguistic construction of group identity between the two corpora. The populist discourse corpus is characterized by strong markers of in-group solidarity and out-group differentiation. This is evidenced by a markedly high rate of first-person plural pronouns ('we', 'us', 'our') at 35.2 instances per 1,000 words and a similarly elevated rate of third-person plural pronouns ('they', 'them') at 22.7 instances per 1,000 words. In stark contrast, the institutional discourse corpus demonstrates a more impersonal and detached linguistic profile, with substantially lower rates of both first-person plural pronouns (10.5 per 1,000 words) and third-person plural pronouns (8.1 per 1,000 words).

The reasoning for this conclusion is grounded in the theoretical functions of these discourse styles. The high frequency of 'we' versus 'they' in the populist corpus is a classic rhetorical strategy for forging a unified "people" (the in-group) in opposition to a perceived elite or external entity (the out-group). This linguistic pattern is a direct reflection of a populist approach that seeks to build social cohesion through shared identity and common opposition. Conversely, the lower frequency of such pronouns in the institutional corpus suggests a discourse oriented toward procedure, policy, and objectivity, where cohesion is derived from adherence to established norms rather than from personalized, collective sentiment.

However, these findings must be qualified by significant limitations. First, the analysis is constrained by the fact that **no specific textual evidence was found** for qualitative review. Without illustrative excerpts, it is impossible to analyze the precise context or attribute specific phrasing to individual speakers, which prevents a deeper, more nuanced understanding of how these cohesion strategies are deployed. Second, the small sample size (N=8) severely limits the generalizability of these results. While the quantitative patterns are distinct and theoretically coherent, they represent a preliminary finding that requires validation with a much larger and more diverse corpus to establish robust statistical significance and broader applicability.
