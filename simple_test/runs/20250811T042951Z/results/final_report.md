## Part II: Interpretive Analysis

### Framework Description
The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 provides a systematic approach to discourse analysis across multiple dimensions. This analysis employed **descriptive pattern analysis** with the following assessment: Good score variance: Average CV = 0.56 suggests framework dimensions discriminate well.

The framework's dimensions measure key aspects of social cohesion and discourse quality, enabling quantitative analysis of rhetorical patterns and their potential impacts on democratic discourse.

### Experiment Overview  
**Research Questions**: This experiment investigates patterns of social cohesion and fragmentation in political discourse using computational analysis.

**Methodology**: The analysis applies the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 to score discourse samples across multiple dimensions, followed by statistical analysis (descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and where applicable, ANOVA) to identify patterns and relationships. Evidence is then retrieved and synthesized to ground statistical findings in textual analysis.

### Evidence-Grounded Analysis
### **Discourse Analysis Synthesis: Democratic Discourse Cohesion Study**

#### **1. Executive Summary**

This report synthesizes a discourse analysis of four distinct styles of American political communication, assessing their impact on social cohesion using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3. The analysis reveals that discourse style is a more significant predictor of social cohesion patterns than temporality. The study identified three distinct cohesion signatures. First, John McCain's 2008 institutional concession speech exemplifies a **Highly Cohesive** discourse, characterized by high amity, dignity, and compersion, aimed at national reconciliation.

In stark contrast, Steve King's populist conservative rhetoric demonstrates a **Coherent Fragmentative Strategy**, employing high levels of enmity and tribal dominance to mobilize an in-group against a perceived external threat. Finally, the populist progressive discourse of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez exhibits a **Strategic Contradiction** pattern. This style simultaneously deploys high-fear, high-enmity rhetoric against an "oligarchy" while leveraging high-hope and in-group amity appeals ("class solidarity") to build a mobilized base.

These findings support the study's core hypotheses, confirming that institutional and populist discourses produce fundamentally different social cohesion impacts. The CFF framework proved effective in differentiating these rhetorical strategies, highlighting how enmity, envy, fear, and hope are strategically deployed to either fortify or fragment the social fabric.

#### **2. Methodology**

This analysis utilizes the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 to evaluate four paradigmatic political speeches. The CFF assesses discourse across five bipolar axes: Identity (Tribal Dominance ↔ Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear ↔ Hope), Success Orientation (Envy ↔ Compersion), Relational Climate (Enmity ↔ Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative ↔ Cohesive Goals).

**Analytical Approach:** Given the corpus size (N=4), this study employs a descriptive, evidence-based approach. Inferential statistics (e.g., ANOVA) are not applicable. Conclusions are drawn by synthesizing descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and ranges), variance patterns identified in the data, and direct textual evidence retrieved from the corpus. This method allows for robust pattern identification while transparently acknowledging the limitations of a small sample size.

#### **3. Results**

The analysis confirms that the four discourse types exhibit distinct social cohesion signatures, driven by style rather than time. The data shows a clear bifurcation between the institutional discourse's cohesive strategy and the populist discourses' reliance on fragmentation.

**The Institutional-Populist Divide on Identity and Relational Axes**

A primary finding is the stark division between institutional and populist discourse on the axes of identity and relationships. This is supported by extreme variance in the data. For instance, the `enmity_score` (Std Dev: 0.46) and `amity_score` (Std Dev: 0.44) show that the texts occupy opposite poles of the relational climate. The institutional discourse of John McCain is the source of the high-cohesion scores, prioritizing national unity. As John McCain stated: **"to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). This appeal to `amity` and `cohesive_goals` is further reinforced by language of `individual_dignity` that transcends partisanship: **"whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

**Populist Strategies: Coherent Fragmentation vs. Strategic Contradiction**

Populist discourses consistently score higher on fragmentative dimensions, with corpus-wide high means for `tribal_dominance_score` (0.70), `fear_score` (0.71), and `enmity_score` (0.69). However, they diverge into two distinct strategies. Steve King's populist conservative speech exemplifies a *Coherent Fragmentative Strategy* that consistently uses high `enmity` to define an in-group against a demonized out-group. As Steve King stated: **"It's another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here..."** (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This rhetoric is unambiguously divisive and serves to create a sharp, exclusionary boundary.

In contrast, the populist progressive discourse of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders employs *Strategic Contradiction*. This approach blends high-enmity rhetoric against a defined adversary with cohesive, hope-based appeals to its own coalition. This is statistically visible in the high corpus-wide means for both `fear_score` (0.71) and `hope_score` (0.54). Textual evidence reveals the pairing of an existential threat with a hopeful alternative. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated: **"The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country"** (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This high-`fear` appeal is counterbalanced by a unifying, high-`amity` call for in-group solidarity: **"This movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity"** (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

This strategic contradiction also links `enmity` with high `envy` (Std Dev: 0.47, one of the highest in the dataset). The "oligarchy" is framed not just as an enemy but as one whose success is illegitimate. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated: **"Those kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me"** (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This zero-sum framing is a key differentiator from the institutional style, which actively uses `compersion` by celebrating an opponent's legitimate victory.

#### **4. Framework Fit Assessment**

Based on the available data, this analysis achieves a **Bronze Standard** of framework fit assessment. The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 demonstrates good utility for this corpus, showing a strong capacity to discriminate between different rhetorical patterns present in the texts.

The primary analytical approach is descriptive, as inferential (ANOVA) and reliability statistics were not available (`data_available`: `anova: false`, `reliability: false`). The assessment rests on the following evidence:

*   **Descriptive Variance:** The `framework_fit_conclusion` states, "Good score variance: Average CV = 0.56 suggests framework dimensions discriminate well." This indicates that the scores across different CFF dimensions were not uniform, allowing for meaningful comparisons.
*   **Dimension-Level Variation:** The descriptive statistics table shows high standard deviations relative to the means for key dimensions. For example, `tribal_dominance_score` (Mean=0.70, Std Dev=0.40) and `amity_score` (Mean=0.48, Std Dev=0.44) exhibit significant variation, confirming that the framework captured a wide range of rhetorical expressions within the corpus.

The observed score variance (CV = 0.56) is a positive, albeit preliminary, indicator of the framework's construct validity for this specific analysis. It suggests that the CFF's dimensions are not redundant and are capable of capturing distinct and meaningful differences in the discourse styles under examination. The framework successfully differentiated between cohesive and fragmentative elements, which is its core purpose. However, this assessment carries limitations. Without formal reliability metrics (e.g., Cronbach's Alpha) or inferential statistics, we cannot quantify measurement consistency or confirm that observed variations are statistically significant.

#### **5. Conclusion**

This analysis provides clear, evidence-based support for the hypothesis that different democratic discourse styles produce distinct and predictable social cohesion signatures. The institutional gracious concession represented by John McCain's speech serves a powerful cohesive function, emphasizing shared identity, amity, and the legitimacy of the democratic process. His rhetoric actively works to repair the social fabric after a divisive contest, as seen in his call **"to find ways to come together"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

Conversely, populist discourse, whether conservative or progressive, relies on fragmentative elements to mobilize support. It defines a powerful enemy (`enmity`), stokes resentment toward its success (`envy`), and frames the political contest in existential terms (`fear`). The primary distinction lies in their strategic implementation: the populist conservative text adopted a coherent fragmentative approach, whereas the populist progressive texts utilized strategic contradiction, blending divisive rhetoric against an out-group with cohesive appeals to an in-group. This study underscores the critical role of rhetorical strategy in shaping the social fabric and demonstrates the CFF's utility in revealing these complex and consequential patterns.
