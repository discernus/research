## Executive Summary
This document summarizes the computational research artifacts generated during experiment run `20250804T225310Z` of the `simple_character_validation_v7` project. The primary goal of this experiment was to validate the `v7.1` "gasket architecture" of the Character Assessment Framework (CAF) by detecting ideological character signatures in text from conservative and progressive speakers. Specifically, it aimed to demonstrate the framework's ability to process and synthesize character coherence patterns using enhanced metadata scores (salience, confidence).

This particular run utilized the `vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` language model and successfully completed its analysis stage in approximately 3.35 seconds, producing two core artifacts: consolidated evidence extracted from the input documents and the raw JSON output from the LLM's analysis.

## Key Artifacts
This experiment run produced the following essential artifacts, providing direct outputs from the computational process:

*   **`analysis_response_74be86ee.json`**
    *   **Path**: `projects/simple_test/runs/20250804T225310Z/artifacts/analysis_response_74be86ee.json`
    *   **Description**: This JSON file contains the raw, structured output directly from the Large Language Model (LLM) after it performed the character analysis. It represents the LLM's initial interpretation and structured data extraction based on the Character Assessment Framework (CAF).
    *   **Purpose**: Essential for understanding the LLM's direct contribution, verifying its outputs, and scrutinizing the raw analytical judgments before any further processing or synthesis.
    *   **Size**: ~10.4 KB

*   **`combined_evidence_v6_66dbafb8`**
    *   **Path**: `projects/simple_test/runs/20250804T225310Z/artifacts/combined_evidence_v6_66dbafb8`
    *   **Description**: This artifact aggregates curated quotes and supporting data extracted from the input corpus documents (`bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt` and `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`). It represents the foundational textual evidence identified for analysis.
    *   **Purpose**: Provides the direct textual evidence base from which the LLM drew its conclusions. Crucial for verifying the relevance and accuracy of the extracted evidence against the original source materials.
    *   **Size**: ~9.2 KB

## File Structure Navigation
The artifacts for this run are organized within the `projects/simple_test/runs/20250804T225310Z` directory. Understanding this structure is key to navigating the computational outputs:

*   **`data/`**: Contains CSV files intended for external statistical analysis, such as scores and extracted evidence for quantitative review.
*   **`artifacts/`**: This directory is the primary repository for the structured outputs of the computational pipeline. It contains:
    *   `artifacts/analysis_plans/`: The LLM's pre-analysis planning artifacts.
    *   `artifacts/analysis_results/`: Raw analysis outputs from the LLM (like `analysis_response_74be86ee.json`).
    *   `artifacts/statistical_results/`: Mathematical computations and metrics derived from the analysis.
    *   `artifacts/evidence/`: Curated quotes and supporting data (like `combined_evidence_v6_66dbafb8`).
    *   `artifacts/reports/`: Final synthesized reports and summaries.
    *   `artifacts/inputs/`: Copies of the framework, corpus, and experiment configuration used for the run.
*   **`technical/`**: Houses system-level information for audit and debugging, including detailed system logs and records of LLM interactions.

## Audit Trail
Robust provenance and an auditable trail are integral to this research. Reviewers can verify the integrity and origin of all artifacts:

*   **`provenance.json`**: Located at the root of the run directory (`projects/simple_test/runs/20250804T225310Z/provenance.json`), this file (part of the data provided to you) acts as a high-level manifest. It summarizes the experiment details, directory structure, pipeline stages, and descriptions of key artifacts.
*   **`technical/manifest.json`**: This detailed manifest, found at `projects/simple_test/runs/20250804T225310Z/technical/manifest.json`, provides a comprehensive record of the run. It includes:
    *   The exact `experiment_config` used.
    *   The `input_artifacts` (corpus documents and framework) with their cryptographic hashes, ensuring their immutability.
    *   The `execution_timeline`, detailing each stage of the computational pipeline, including agent names, models used, and precise start/end times.
    *   `audit_references` pointing to specific log files for in-depth inspection.
*   **`technical/logs/`**: This directory (`projects/simple_test/runs/20250804T225310Z/technical/logs/`) contains granular operational logs:
    *   `llm_interactions.jsonl`: Records every query and response between the system and the LLM, crucial for understanding model behavior and verifying its inputs/outputs.
    *   `system.jsonl`, `agents.jsonl`, `orchestrator.jsonl`: Provide comprehensive system-level execution details, agent activities, and overall workflow orchestration.
    *   `costs.jsonl`: Logs any associated computational costs, ensuring financial transparency.
*   **Artifact Hashing**: Each significant artifact is assigned a cryptographic hash (e.g., `74be86ee...`) which is recorded in the `artifact_registry` and `technical/manifest.json`. This hash can be used to verify the integrity and immutability of the artifact files.

Together, these files provide a complete, verifiable audit trail from experiment configuration to final artifact generation, allowing for thorough inspection and reproduction.

## External Reviewer Guide
Depending on your focus, specific sets of artifacts are most relevant for review:

*   **For Replication Researchers**:
    *   Examine the `artifacts/` directory for all generated outputs.
    *   Review `technical/manifest.json` to understand the exact experimental configuration, input documents, and workflow.
    *   Consult `README.md` (if present) for general experiment setup instructions.
*   **For Fraud Auditors**:
    *   Prioritize `technical/manifest.json` for a complete execution record.
    *   Thoroughly inspect `technical/logs/` for any anomalies in system behavior, agent execution, or LLM interactions.
    *   Verify `provenance.json` for high-level run metadata.
*   **For LLM Skeptics**:
    *   Scrutinize `technical/model_interactions/` (specifically `technical/logs/llm_interactions.jsonl` if `model_interactions` directory is symbolic) to directly observe LLM prompts and responses.
    *   Examine `data/reliability_metrics.csv` (if generated) to assess the consistency and robustness of LLM outputs.
    *   Directly review `artifacts/analysis_results/analysis_response_74be86ee.json` to see the raw LLM output.
