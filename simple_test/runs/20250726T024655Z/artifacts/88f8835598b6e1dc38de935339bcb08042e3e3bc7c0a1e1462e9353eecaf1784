It is `caf_v4_3_tension_enhanced`, a Character Assessment Framework version 4.3, which includes new capabilities for Character Tension Pattern Analysis and the Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI).\n\n**Framework Name:** Character Assessment Framework v4.3 - Tension Enhanced\n**Version:** v4.3\n**Key Enhancements:**\n*   **Character Tension Scoring:** Quantifies moral contradictions between opposing character traits. Formula: `min(Virtue_score, Vice_score) * |Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|`.\n*   **Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI):** Overall character tension measurement. Formula: `(Sum of all 5 Character Tension Scores) / 5`.\n*   **Character Pattern Classification:** Classifies MC-SCI into Moral Coherence (0.00-0.10), Character Complexity (0.11-0.20), Character Ambivalence (0.21-0.30), Character Contradiction (0.31+).\n*   **Preserved CAF v4.2 Functionality:** Includes salience-weighted calculations for Virtue/Vice Cluster Scores, Character Balance, Character Intensity, Moral Clarity, and Character Salience Concentration (Standard Deviation of salience scores).\n\n### DOCUMENTS DECODING\n\n**DOCUMENT 1:**\n*   **Filename:** document1.txt\n*   **Hash:** 994460e392c8...\n*   **Decoded Content:** `My fellow Americans, today we face challenges that require unity and decisive action.

Truth (0.7) was initially ranked below Dignity (0.6) but was corrected to reflect its higher salience score.\n\n**Confidence assessment (0.0-1.0) for each numerical result:**\n\n*   **Individual Intensity/Salience Scores:** Confidence for these scores ranges from 0.7 to 1.0, reflecting the clarity and directness of evidence in the short documents. Scores of 0.0 (absence of trait) generally have higher confidence (1.0) due to clear lack of evidence.\n*   **Derived Cluster Scores (Virtue/Vice Cluster, Balance, Intensity, Moral Clarity):** Confidence for these aggregated scores is high (0.95) because they are direct mathematical derivations from the individual scores, assuming the individual scores are accurate.\n*   **Character Tension Scores:** Confidence for individual tension scores is high (0.9) as they are direct mathematical applications of the formula to the individual scores and salience values.\n*   **MC-SCI:** Confidence is high (0.95) as it is a direct average of the tension scores.\n*   **Character Salience Concentration (CSC):** Confidence is high (0.95) as it is a direct statistical calculation from the salience scores.\n\n**Any mathematical concerns or limitations identified:**\n\n*   **Subjectivity of Initial Scores:** The initial assignment of intensity and salience scores (0.0-1.0) is inherently subjective and relies on qualitative interpretation of the text. While reasoning and evidence are provided, different analysts might assign slightly different initial scores, which would propagate through all subsequent calculations. This is a fundamental limitation of any qualitative-to-quantitative assessment.\n*   **Short Document Length:** The brevity of the documents limits the depth of character demonstration and the range of rhetorical choices available for analysis. This might lead to lower intensity/salience scores for traits that are simply not addressed, rather than actively absent. This could potentially skew the MC-SCI if certain traits are not present to create tension.\n*   **Zero Salience Denominator:** For cluster scores, if the sum of salience for all virtues or all vices were 0, the division would be by zero. In these documents, the sums were non-zero, so this was not an issue. However, it's a theoretical edge case to consider for robustness.\n*   **Interpretation of Tension Formula:** The tension formula `min(Virtue_score, Vice_score) * |Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|` implies that tension only arises when *both* a virtue and its opposing vice are present to some degree (`min` > 0) AND there is a difference in their salience. If both are present but equally salient, the tension is 0. If one is absent, tension is 0. This specific mathematical definition of \"tension\" is critical to understanding the MC-SCI.\n\n---\n\n### OUTPUT\n\n```json\n{\n  \"worldview\": \"The speaker presents a civic-minded,
