## 🚦 Audit Workflow Recommendations

### Quick Integrity Check (5 minutes)
1. Verify `manifest.json` shows successful completion
2. Check `results/final_report.md` exists and is substantial
3. Confirm `artifacts/provenance.json` shows complete artifact chain
4. Spot-check one artifact symlink resolves correctly

### Standard Audit (30 minutes)
1. **Inputs Verification**: Review `artifacts/inputs/` for frameworks and data sources
2. **Analysis Verification**: Examine `artifacts/analysis_results/` for AI system outputs
3. **Computation Verification**: Check `artifacts/statistical_results/` for mathematical work
4. **Evidence Verification**: Review `artifacts/evidence/` for supporting evidence
5. **Cost Verification**: Check `logs/costs.jsonl` for reasonable resource usage

### Deep Forensic Audit (2+ hours)
1. **Complete Log Analysis**: Full review of `logs/` directory
2. **Artifact Chain Verification**: Validate every symlink and dependency
3. **LLM Interaction Analysis**: Review `logs/llm_interactions.jsonl` for prompt engineering
4. **Reproducibility Testing**: Attempt replication using preserved inputs
5. **Statistical Validation**: Independent verification of mathematical computations

## 🔐 Cryptographic Provenance System

### Content-Addressable Storage
Every artifact in this system is stored using **content-addressable hashing**:
- **SHA-256 hashes**: Each file's content generates a unique 256-bit fingerprint
- **Tamper detection**: Any modification changes the hash, making tampering immediately evident
- **Deduplication**: Identical content across runs shares the same hash, ensuring efficiency
- **Verification**: Run `sha256sum` on any artifact to verify its integrity

### Hash-Based Artifact Identification
```bash
# Example: Verify an artifact hasn't been tampered with
sha256sum artifacts/analysis_results/analysis_response_185f5e58.json
# Should match: 185f5e58f8a7a05836183257ddecd52a3f5768272a30e6a8c2e8865d8008c273
```

### Git-Based Permanent Provenance
- **Immutable history**: Every research run is committed to Git with timestamps
- **Distributed verification**: Git's distributed nature enables independent verification
- **Branching strategy**: Research runs are preserved across branches for long-term access
- **Cryptographic signatures**: Git commits can be cryptographically signed for additional security

### Symlink Architecture for Efficiency
- **Shared cache**: Common artifacts (frameworks, models) stored once, linked many times
- **Performance**: No duplication of large files across multiple runs
- **Integrity**: Symlinks point to content-addressed files, maintaining hash verification
- **Transparency**: All links are relative and auditable

### Dependency Chain Verification
The system maintains a complete **cryptographic dependency graph**:
```
Input Data (hash_A) → Analysis (hash_B) → Synthesis (hash_C) → Results (hash_D)
```
- Each stage records the hashes of its inputs in metadata
- Auditors can verify the complete chain from raw data to conclusions
- Any break in the chain indicates potential tampering or data loss

### Academic Integrity Guarantees
This cryptographic system provides **mathematical proof** of:
1. **Data integrity**: Content hasn't been modified since creation
2. **Provenance completeness**: All inputs to conclusions are preserved
3. **Temporal ordering**: Git timestamps prove sequence of operations
4. **Reproducibility**: Exact inputs preserved for independent replication

### Verification Commands for Auditors
```bash
# Verify artifact integrity
sha256sum artifacts/statistical_results/*.json

# Check Git history for this run
git log --oneline --grep="20250804T175152Z"

# Validate symlink targets exist and match hashes
find artifacts/ -type l -exec ls -la {} \;

# Verify dependency chain in artifact metadata
grep -r "dependencies" artifacts/*/
```

## 🤝 Auditor Support

### Common Questions
- **"Is this data fabricated?"** → All artifacts are cryptographically hashed and linked to source
- **"Can I trust the AI system outputs?"** → Raw AI responses preserved in `artifacts/analysis_results/`
