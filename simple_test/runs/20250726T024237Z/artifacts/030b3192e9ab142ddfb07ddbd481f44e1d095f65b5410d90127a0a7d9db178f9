The use of `min()` and `abs()` functions, as well as standard deviation and weighted averages, has been correctly applied. No mathematical errors were identified during the self-check. The precision was maintained consistently, with tension scores and MC-SCI at 3 decimal places, and other aggregate scores at 2 decimal places.\n\n### Confidence Assessment for Numerical Results\n\n*   **Individual Character Scores (Intensity & Salience):** Confidence for these scores ranges from 0.6 to 0.9, reflecting the inherent subjectivity in interpreting qualitative text into quantitative scores. The confidence is higher for traits with clear, direct textual evidence and lower for those with less explicit or absent evidence.\n*   **Character Tension Scores:** Confidence for these calculations is high (0.95) because they are direct applications of a defined mathematical formula to the initial scores. Any variability comes from the initial scoring.\n*   **Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI):** Confidence is high (0.98) as it's a simple average of the tension scores, which are themselves derived mathematically.\n*   **Character Salience Concentration (CSC):** Confidence is high (0.98) as it's a standard statistical calculation (standard deviation) applied to the salience scores.\n*   **Character Cluster Scores (Virtue/Vice), Character Balance, Character Intensity, Moral Clarity:** Confidence for these aggregate scores is high (0.98) as they are direct applications of the salience-weighted formulas.\n\n### Mathematical Concerns or Limitations Identified\n\n1.  **Subjectivity of Initial Scoring:** The primary limitation lies in the initial assignment of intensity and salience scores (0.0-1.0) to character traits. While guided by keywords and rhetorical analysis, this process is inherently qualitative and relies on expert judgment. This subjectivity propagates through all subsequent calculations. The confidence estimates provided for individual scores reflect this.\n2.  **Interpretation of Salience Concentration (CSC) Ranges:** The framework defines \"Focused Character\" (CSC > 0.3) and \"Distributed Character\" (CSC < 0.2). For both documents, the calculated CSC (0.28 for Document 1, 0.25 for Document 2) falls between these two thresholds. This indicates a moderately distributed character, but the framework does not provide a specific classification for this intermediate range. This is a limitation of the classification scheme, not the calculation itself.\n3.  **Formulaic Nature:** The framework relies on specific mathematical formulas for tension and cluster scores. While these formulas are applied correctly, their conceptual validity (e.g., `min(score) * |salience_diff|` for tension) is assumed as per the framework's design.\n\nOverall, the mathematical operations are robust and accurately executed given the input scores. The primary area for potential variability or debate lies in the initial qualitative assessment of character intensity and salience.",
