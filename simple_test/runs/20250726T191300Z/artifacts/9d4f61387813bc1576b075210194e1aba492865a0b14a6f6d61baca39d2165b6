The low tension scores arise because for most virtue-vice pairs, either the virtue intensity is very low (e.g., Dignity, Truth, Hope, Pragmatism) or the salience difference is small (e.g., Truth-Manipulation, Justice-Resentment). This indicates that while the speaker *rejects* virtues, they don't necessarily exhibit *internal conflict* between a virtue and its opposing vice; rather, they simply embrace the vice. The 'Moral Coherence' classification here implies a consistent, albeit negative, moral stance rather than internal struggle. The character cluster analysis, showing a significantly higher vice cluster score and negative balance, more directly reflects the speaker's overall moral direction.
