## File Structure Navigation

The run directory (`/Volumes/code/discernus/projects/simple_test/runs/20250804T230826Z`) is organized as follows to aid in artifact discovery:

*   **`data/`**: Contains raw data files (e.g., CSVs) suitable for external statistical analysis.
*   **`artifacts/`**: This is the primary directory for research outputs, further categorized into:
    *   `artifacts/analysis_plans/`: Contains the structured plans developed by the LLM for analysis.
    *   `artifacts/analysis_results/`: Holds the raw, machine-readable outputs from the LLM's analytical processes.
    *   `artifacts/statistical_results/`: Contains the detailed mathematical computations and statistical metrics.
    *   `artifacts/evidence/`: Houses curated pieces of evidence that directly support the research findings.
    *   `artifacts/reports/`: Contains the synthesized and final reporting documents.
    *   `artifacts/inputs/`: Includes all configuration files, framework details, and corpus information used in the run.
*   **`technical/`**: This directory is dedicated to system-level information, including logs and records of model interactions, crucial for auditing and reproducibility.

## Audit Trail

The integrity and provenance of artifacts are maintained through systematic logging and versioning. The `provenance.json` file (located in the run's root directory, though not explicitly listed in the provided data, it's implied by the reviewer guide) serves as a central manifest. It records the lineage of each artifact, including its creation timestamp, source run, and associated metadata. The `technical/manifest.json` file, as indicated for fraud auditors, likely contains a more detailed system-level manifest for verifying artifact completeness and integrity against the run's execution. The `technical/logs/` and `technical/model_interactions/` directories provide granular system and model behavior records, essential for in-depth audits.

## External Reviewer Guide

For peer reviewers, we recommend focusing on the following artifacts to gain a comprehensive understanding of the experiment:

1.  **`final_report_2025-08-04_b8554f59.md`**: To understand the overall findings and conclusions.
2.  **`curated_evidence_89b0de83.json`**: To examine the specific evidence supporting the claims made in the report.
3.  **`statistical_results_b200af7a.json`**: To verify the quantitative underpinnings of the analysis.
4.  **`analysis_plan_a0de9214.md`**: To understand the methodological approach taken by the LLM.
5.  **`data/` directory**: To conduct independent statistical analysis if desired.

Reviewers interested in the LLM's internal reasoning should consult `artifacts/analysis_results/` and potentially `technical/model_interactions/`.
