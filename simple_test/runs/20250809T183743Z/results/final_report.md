### **Executive Summary**

This report synthesizes the discourse analysis of John McCain's 2008 institutional concession speech and Bernie Sanders' 2025 populist critique. The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) was used to compare their respective impacts on social cohesion. The analysis confirms that the two discourse styles exhibit distinct, complex, and statistically significant social cohesion signatures.

McCain's institutional discourse demonstrates a **Coherent Cohesive Strategy**, characterized by high scores in `amity` (0.90) and `cohesive_goals` (0.90). However, it also features a high `strategic_contradiction_index` (0.19), revealing a sophisticated blend of unifying rhetoric with acknowledgements of political conflict and national threats. This tension is central to the genre of gracious concession.

Sanders' populist discourse presents a **Fragmentative Discourse** profile, with dominant scores in `enmity` (0.95) and `envy` (0.90). This is strategically balanced by a high `cohesive_index` (0.42), driven by strong cohesive appeals to his in-group. This signature reveals a strategy of targeted fragmentation against an out-group to foster solidarity and hope within a defined in-group.

The CFF proved highly effective, as all dimensions showed statistically significant discriminatory power (p ≤ 0.001) in distinguishing the two rhetorical approaches.

### **Methodology**

This study analyzed two documents—John McCain's 2008 concession speech (institutional) and Bernie Sanders' 2025 anti-oligarchy speech (populist)—using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3. The CFF evaluates discourse across five axes: Identity, Emotional Climate, Success Orientation, Relational Climate, and Goal Orientation. Analysis involved scoring each text on the CFF's ten primary dimensions and calculating composite metrics, including the `cohesive_index`, `fragmentative_index`, and `strategic_contradiction_index`. The analysis focused on identifying and comparing the distinct "social cohesion signatures" of each discourse style.

### **Results**

The analysis confirms that institutional and populist discourse employ fundamentally different, yet equally complex, rhetorical strategies. The CFF effectively captured these distinctions, with ANOVA results indicating that every dimension of the framework produced statistically significant differences between the two speeches (all p-values ≤ 0.001), confirming **Hypothesis H3**.

#### **Signature 1: Institutional Cohesion (John McCain)**

McCain’s speech is characterized by its overwhelmingly cohesive nature, confirming **Hypothesis H1**. It scored high on `amity` (0.90), `hope` (0.80), and `cohesive_goals` (0.90). This is evident in calls to "find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences" and pledges to offer the victor "our good will and earnest effort."

However, the discourse is not rhetorically simple. It registered a high `strategic_contradiction_index` (0.19), driven by a necessary blend of cohesion and realism. The text pairs unifying appeals with acknowledgements of external threats and internal conflict. For instance, the cohesive goal of finding compromise is framed within the context of the need to "defend our security in a dangerous world" (fear score: 0.30). Similarly, amity is balanced by an acknowledgement of political reality: "Senator Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed" (enmity score: 0.20). This rhetorical tension is a key feature of legitimizing a democratic transition.

This signature is further defined by the suppression of resentment. Despite the context of an electoral loss, the speech scores low on `envy` (0.10), instead prioritizing a shared identity: "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans."

#### **Signature 2: Populist Fragmentation & In-Group Solidarity (Bernie Sanders)**

Sanders' speech exhibits a highly fragmentative profile, confirming the first part of **Hypothesis H2**. The discourse is built on strong `enmity` (0.95) and `envy` (0.90), with no evidence of `compersion` (0.00). The relational climate is overtly adversarial, characterizing opponents as "not nice guys." This enmity is linked to a tribal framework that pits an in-group against an "oligarchic form of society."

Crucially, this fragmentation is not an end in itself but a tool for in-group mobilization, confirming the second part of **H2** regarding sophisticated positioning. Despite high fragmentation, the speech has a high `cohesive_index` (0.42), driven by `cohesive_goals` (0.80) and `individual_dignity` (0.70) aimed at its supporters. The fragmentative critique is presented as a necessary precondition for a cohesive outcome, as seen when the declaration "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society" is thematically linked to the promise that "we can create the kind of nation that we deserve." This reveals a strategy where fragmenting from an out-group is the primary mechanism for unifying an in-group.

#### **Comparative Patterns and Rhetorical Complexity**

The study reveals two distinct cross-dimensional patterns. McCain’s institutional discourse creates an **amity-cohesion nexus**, where amity ("I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens") is directly linked to cohesive goals ("to find ways to come together"). In contrast, Sanders' populist discourse builds an **enmity-tribalism nexus**, where enmity ("These guys... are not nice guys") galvanizes a tribal in-group ("if we stand together, are strong") toward a shared goal.

Finally, neither speech was rhetorically simplistic. Both McCain's and Sanders' discourses showed high variance across CFF dimensions (`dimension_standard_deviation` of 0.34 and 0.36, respectively). This indicates that effective political communication in both genres requires a dynamic and complex application of rhetorical appeals.

### **Conclusion**

This analysis demonstrates that institutional and populist discourses generate distinct, statistically significant, and rhetorically complex social cohesion signatures.

1.  **Institutional discourse**, as exemplified by McCain, builds social cohesion by subordinating political loss to the higher goals of national unity and peaceful transition. It manages the inherent tension of this process through a sophisticated blend of amity toward opponents and a sober acknowledgement of ongoing differences and threats.

2.  **Populist discourse**, as shown by Sanders, operates by sharpening social divisions. It uses fragmentative appeals like enmity and envy to delegitimize an out-group, thereby creating a strong, cohesive, and hopeful identity for its target in-group.

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework proved to be a highly effective instrument for distinguishing these strategies. The findings reveal two divergent rhetorical models for managing political difference in a democracy: one focused on bridging divides through shared identity and compromise, the other on leveraging those divides to mobilize a political base.
