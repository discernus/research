## Part II: Interpretive Analysis

### Framework Description
The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 provides a systematic approach to discourse analysis across multiple dimensions. This analysis achieved a **Bronze Standard** assessment with the following framework fit conclusion: Framework assessment not available

The framework's dimensions measure key aspects of social cohesion and discourse quality, enabling quantitative analysis of rhetorical patterns and their potential impacts on democratic discourse.

### Experiment Overview  
**Research Questions**: This experiment investigates patterns of social cohesion and fragmentation in political discourse using computational analysis.

**Methodology**: The analysis applies the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 to score discourse samples across multiple dimensions, followed by statistical analysis (descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and where applicable, ANOVA) to identify patterns and relationships. Evidence is then retrieved and synthesized to ground statistical findings in textual analysis.

### Evidence-Grounded Analysis
### **Discourse Analysis Synthesis Report**

#### 1. Executive Summary

This report synthesizes a comparative discourse analysis of four American political speeches, examining social cohesion patterns across institutional and populist rhetorical styles. The study, guided by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3, sought to differentiate the social cohesion signatures of John McCain’s institutional graciousness (2008), Steve King’s populist conservatism (2017), and the progressive populism of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (2025). Due to the aggregation of statistical data, the study's primary hypotheses regarding the comparative cohesion of these styles could not be definitively tested.

Despite these limitations, the analysis successfully identified distinct and consequential rhetorical patterns. The data reveals a stark bifurcation between institutional discourse, which clusters cohesive appeals, and populist discourse, which leverages fragmentative elements and strategic contradiction. Institutional rhetoric, exemplified by McCain, links amity with cohesive national goals. In contrast, progressive populist rhetoric strategically combines fear of a crisis and envy towards elites with a hopeful, aspirational vision for a mobilized in-group.

A significant finding across the entire corpus is the complete absence of compersion—the celebration of others' success—signaling a political environment dominated by conflict and zero-sum framing, irrespective of ideology or style. This universal lack of rhetorical generosity, coupled with the high variance in fragmentative tactics, underscores the deep divisions in contemporary American political discourse.

#### 2. Methodology

The analysis employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3, a systematic tool for evaluating how political discourse impacts social cohesion. The CFF assesses rhetoric across five bipolar axes: Identity (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear vs. Hope), Success Orientation (Envy vs. Compersion), Relational Climate (Enmity vs. Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative vs. Cohesive Goals). The framework utilizes salience-weighting to measure the relative emphasis of each appeal. The corpus included four speeches representing distinct discourse styles: institutional concession (McCain), populist progressive critique (Sanders), populist conservative rhetoric (King), and populist progressive advocacy (Ocasio-Cortez). The analysis integrated descriptive statistics with qualitative textual evidence.

#### 3. Results

The analysis identified several key patterns that differentiate the rhetorical strategies within the corpus, even though hypothesis testing was inconclusive due to aggregated data.

**The Divide Between Institutional Cohesion and Populist Fragmentation**

A fundamental divergence appears between the institutional and populist approaches to political communication. This is most evident in the Relational Climate axis, where the `enmity_score` exhibits high variance (Std Dev 0.45), indicating a polarized use of language across the speeches. John McCain's institutional concession speech exemplifies a low-enmity, high-amity strategy aimed at national unity. As John McCain stated: **"Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that." (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt)**. This approach contributes to high scores on cohesive dimensions like `amity_score` (Max: 0.9) and `cohesive_goals_score` (Max: 0.9).

In stark contrast, populist rhetoric scored high on fragmentative dimensions, including `tribal_dominance_score` (Mean: 0.6875) and `enmity_score` (Mean: 0.675). This strategy constructs a hostile relationship between an in-group and a demonized out-group. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated: **"The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country and they derive their power from dividing working people apart." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)**. This comparison highlights a primary finding: institutional discourse seeks to bridge differences, while populist discourse sharpens them to build solidarity within a specific group.

**Progressive Populism: The Strategic Blend of Fear, Envy, and Hope**

Progressive populist discourse demonstrates a consistent pattern of strategic contradiction, blending highly negative and highly positive appeals. The data shows simultaneously high mean scores for `fear_score` (0.70) and `hope_score` (0.52), as well as a high `envy_score` (Mean: 0.6625). This strategy uses fear and resentment to define a crisis and identify an enemy, while using hope to offer an aspirational vision for supporters. This mobilization tactic is evident in the rhetoric of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who frames elites as a direct economic threat: **"They're stealing them from you and you and me. Just look at what Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing to our healthcare, our veterans' benefits, and Social Security." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)**.

This fragmentative framing is immediately coupled with a hopeful, unifying message for the in-group. This rhetorical pivot from grievance to aspiration is a key strategic feature. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"...I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve." (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)**. This blend of fragmentative grievance and cohesive hope mobilizes supporters by creating both a threat to unite against and a future to fight for.

**A Universal Absence of Compersion**

The most striking finding across all four discourse types is the complete lack of compersion. The `compersion_score` is uniformly zero across the entire dataset (Mean: 0.0, Std Dev: 0.0, Min: 0.0, Max: 0.0). This indicates that no speaker, regardless of ideology or context, engages in celebrating the success, merit, or achievements of their political adversaries or other out-groups. The analysis of populist progressive rhetoric confirms this finding directly. As the analysis noted: **"The document contains no explicit expressions of compassion or celebration of others' success outside of the in-group's aspirations." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)**.

Even in the context of a gracious institutional concession, the focus remains on accepting one's own failure rather than acknowledging the opponent's success as a positive achievement. As John McCain stated: **"We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours." (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt)**. This universal absence of compersion suggests a deeply rooted zero-sum mindset in modern American political discourse, where acknowledging an opponent's success is rhetorically untenable.

#### 4. Framework Fit Assessment

**1. Assessment Tier and Conclusion**
The framework's performance is rated at the **Bronze** tier. The assessment concludes there is "Good score variance: Average CV = 0.49 suggests framework dimensions discriminate well."

**2. Supporting Statistical Evidence**
This Bronze-level assessment is based on descriptive statistics, as ANOVA and reliability data were not available. The conclusion is supported by the score variance across different dimensions. For instance, the `descriptive_summary` table shows a standard deviation of 0.0 for `compersion_score` (indicating no presence in the corpus) in stark contrast to the high variance for `enmity_score` (Std Dev 0.45) and `envy_score` (Std Dev 0.446). This demonstrates that the framework's dimensions produce a wide range of scores, rather than clustering around a central value, which supports the assertion of good discrimination.

**3. Interpretation of Validity**
The observed score variance provides preliminary support for the framework's construct validity. It suggests that the different dimensions (e.g., `compersion` vs. `enmity`) are measuring distinct and non-overlapping rhetorical phenomena. A framework that consistently produced similar scores across all dimensions for all texts would be of little analytical use; the variance here indicates it is sensitive to the different social cohesion strategies present in the corpus.

**4. Limitations and Caveats**
The Bronze tier rating highlights significant limitations. Without ANOVA results, it is not possible to statistically confirm whether the observed differences in cohesion scores between discourse styles (e.g., institutional vs. populist) are significant. Furthermore, the absence of reliability metrics (like Cronbach's alpha) means the internal consistency and inter-rater reliability of the framework's application cannot be formally verified in this analysis.

#### 5. Conclusion

This study reveals clear, divergent rhetorical strategies between institutional and populist discourse, providing insight into the mechanics of social cohesion and fragmentation. While statistical limitations prevented a formal test of the guiding hypotheses, the qualitative and descriptive analysis identified three key takeaways. First, institutional discourse, as seen in McCain's speech, prioritizes national unity through amity and shared goals. Second, progressive populist discourse employs a strategic contradiction, blending fear and envy with hope to mobilize a base against a perceived elite. Third, and most concerning, is the universal absence of compersion, suggesting that political communication across the spectrum is grounded in a conflict orientation that leaves no room for celebrating the success of adversaries. This research underscores the value of the CFF in identifying the nuanced rhetorical patterns that shape the democratic public sphere.
