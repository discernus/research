## Part II: Interpretive Analysis

### **Discourse Analysis Synthesis: Institutional vs. Populist Rhetoric**

#### **Executive Summary**

This report synthesizes a discourse analysis comparing two distinct forms of American political communication: John McCain's 2008 institutional concession speech and a populist floor speech by Bernie Sanders. The analysis, guided by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3, sought to identify the social cohesion signatures of each rhetorical style. While the absence of quantitative statistical results renders formal hypothesis testing inconclusive, the qualitative analysis reveals starkly different, sophisticated strategies. McCain's institutional discourse fosters social cohesion through high amity and appeals to shared national goals, while strategically omitting direct praise for his opponent. Conversely, Sanders' populist critique employs strategic contradiction, pairing fragmentative enmity toward an "oligarchic" out-group with cohesive, hopeful appeals to a mobilized in-group. These findings illustrate that institutional and populist discourse employ fundamentally different mechanisms to construct their political realities and impact the social fabric.

#### **Methodology**

The analysis utilized the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v7.3 to evaluate two texts from the study's corpus: John McCain's 2008 presidential concession speech, representing institutional discourse, and Bernie Sanders' 2025 "Fighting Oligarchy" speech, representing populist critique. The CFF framework assesses discourse across five axes: Identity (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear vs. Hope), Success Orientation (Envy vs. Compersion), Relational Climate (Enmity vs. Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative vs. Cohesive Goals). This synthesis integrates findings from initial hypothesis testing, anomaly investigation, and pattern analysis. It must be noted that due to a lack of statistical outputs, all conclusions are based on qualitative textual evidence and analytical notes.

#### **Detailed Results**

The analysis revealed distinct rhetorical signatures for institutional and populist discourse, even though formal hypothesis testing was inconclusive due to missing statistical data.

**Discourse Signature Comparison**

The two speeches demonstrated opposing approaches to political communication. McCain’s institutional discourse prioritized national unity and procedural legitimacy. This is evidenced by his focus on amity and cohesive goals, stating, **"to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity..."** He reinforces this by foregrounding a shared identity that transcends political division, as evidenced by: **"Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that."**

In stark contrast, Sanders' populist discourse centered on societal conflict and establishing a clear out-group. This fragmentative approach is built on high enmity and tribal dominance. The text states: **"We will not accept an oligarchic form of society."** This establishes a tribal "us vs. them" frame, further reinforced by personal demonization of the out-group, as evidenced by: **"These guys, I want to tell you something because I bump into them in my line of work, they are not nice guys."**

**Rhetorical Nuance and Strategic Contradiction**

Further investigation revealed that neither speech was monolithically cohesive or fragmentative. McCain’s institutional graciousness was qualified by a strategic omission. The analysis notes a lack of celebratory language for his opponent's specific platform, stating: **"No direct evidence of compassion found towards groups whose success is being critiqued. The text focuses on the a negative impacts of their actions."** This indicates a subtle distancing that maintains partisan identity without resorting to overt enmity.

Sanders’ speech demonstrated a sophisticated use of strategic contradiction. The fragmentative attacks on the "oligarchy" were balanced with powerful, cohesive appeals to his own supporters. This is evidenced by the combination of high-enmity phrases with high-hope messages for the in-group, such as: **"if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve."** This pattern suggests that populist rhetoric achieves its mobilizing power by simultaneously defining a clear enemy and offering a hopeful, cohesive vision for "the people."

**Identified Rhetorical Patterns**

The analysis identified a clear linkage in McCain's speech between amity and cohesive goals, where appeals to cooperation are used to frame integrative, national objectives. This is supported by the call **"...to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises..."** which directly follows an appeal to shared identity as **"fellow Americans."** This pattern is characteristic of institutional discourse aimed at reinforcing democratic norms.

#### **Conclusion**

This study contrasts two potent models of democratic discourse. The institutional model, exemplified by John McCain, builds social cohesion through appeals to shared identity, amity, and collaborative national goals, upholding the norms of gracious transition. Its fragmentative elements are subtle, manifesting as strategic omissions rather than direct attacks. The populist model, exemplified by Bernie Sanders, operates through strategic contradiction. It deliberately creates social division by targeting an out-group with high enmity while simultaneously building powerful in-group cohesion through appeals to hope and shared purpose. While quantitative validation was not possible, the qualitative evidence strongly supports the conclusion that these two discourse styles possess distinct social cohesion signatures, with significant implications for democratic resilience and social fabric.
