The speaker's character is assessed across ten dimensions (five virtues, five vices) for intensity and salience. The analysis reveals a highly tribalistic and resentful character, prioritizing retributive justice and rejecting traditional civic virtues. Mathematical calculations quantify moral tensions, overall strategic contradiction, and character cluster dynamics, indicating a morally coherent but vice-dominant character with a moderate focus on specific moral priorities.\",\n  \"document_analyses\": {\n    \"document1.txt\": {\n      \"worldview\": \"The speaker presents a highly adversarial, zero-sum worldview rooted in historical grievance and a belief in systemic oppression.
