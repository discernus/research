The corpus reveals a striking dichotomy in moral orientation and worldview.\n\n**Document 'document1.txt'** presents a character deeply rooted in **vice-driven motivations**, particularly Tribalism, Resentment, Manipulation, Fear, and Fantasy. Its worldview is revolutionary and adversarial, prioritizing group-specific retribution over universal principles. Despite this strong negative leaning, the analysis indicates \"Moral Coherence\" (MC-SCI: 0.10), signifying a consistent alignment of low virtue salience with low virtue intensity, and high vice salience with high vice intensity, minimizing internal moral conflict. The character is highly focused on these dominant negative traits.\n\nIn stark contrast, **Document 'document2.txt'** embodies a character strongly aligned with **virtue-driven principles**, emphasizing Dignity, Truth, Justice, Hope, and Pragmatism. Its worldview is progressive, inclusive, and reformist, advocating for systemic change through universal values and collaborative effort. This document also exhibits \"Moral Coherence\" (MC-SCI: 0.074), reflecting a consistent and strong commitment to virtues and a clear rejection of vices.\n\nOverall, the corpus demonstrates two highly coherent but opposing moral frameworks: one advocating for destructive, tribalistic change, and the other for constructive, inclusive progress. The analyses highlight how \"moral coherence\" can manifest in characters with vastly different ethical leanings, indicating a lack of internal struggle rather than an inherently \"good\" or \"bad\" moral stance.\n\n## Corpus-Wide Statistical Analysis\n\nGiven the small corpus size (N=2), statistical measures primarily highlight the significant differences between the two documents rather than broad trends.\n\n### Average and Standard Deviation of Core Scores (Intensity & Salience)\n\n| Dimension    | Avg. Intensity | Std. Dev. Intensity | Avg. Salience | Std. Dev. Salience |\n|:-------------|:---------------|:--------------------|:--------------|:-------------------|\n| Dignity      | 0.55           | 0.35                | 0.50          | 0.40               |\n| Truth        | 0.45           | 0.35                | 0.45          | 0.35               |\n| Justice      | 0.75           | 0.15                | 0.80          | 0.10               |\n| Hope         | 0.50           | 0.30                | 0.50          | 0.30               |\n| Pragmatism   | 0.45           | 0.35                | 0.45          | 0.35               |\n| Tribalism    | 0.50           | 0.40                | 0.50          | 0.40               |\n| Resentment   | 0.50           | 0.40                | 0.50          | 0.40               |\n| Manipulation | 0.40           | 0.30                | 0.40          | 0.30               |\n| Fear         | 0.40           | 0.30                | 0.40          | 0.30               |\n| Fantasy      | 0.40           | 0.30                | 0.40          | 0.30               |\n\n### Average and Standard Deviation of Derived Character Metrics\n\n| Metric                       | Average | Std. Dev. |\n|:-----------------------------|:--------|:----------|\n| MC-SCI                       | 0.087   | 0.013     |\n| Virtue Cluster Score         | 0.632   | 0.211     |\n| Vice Cluster Score           | 0.445   | 0.345     |\n| Character Balance            | 0.18    | 0.55      |\n| Character Intensity          | 0.538   | 0.067     |\n| Moral Clarity                | 0.55    | 0.18      |\n| Character Salience Concentration | 0.346   | 0.026     |\n\n### Identification of Outliers / Unusual Scoring Patterns\n\nThe two documents represent extreme ends of the moral spectrum within the defined framework, making each an \"outlier\" relative to the other.\n\n*   **Character Balance:** Document 'document1.txt' has a Character Balance of **-0.37** (vice-dominant), while 'document2.txt' has **0.74** (virtue-dominant). This is the most significant divergence, indicating fundamentally different moral orientations.\n*   **Virtue/Vice Cluster Scores:** Document 'document1.txt' shows a Virtue Cluster Score of **0.42** and a Vice Cluster Score of **0.79**. Conversely, 'document2.txt' has a Virtue Cluster Score of **0.84** and a Vice Cluster Score of **0.10**. These inverse patterns highlight the opposing moral priorities.\n*   **Moral Coherence (MC-SCI):** Both documents exhibit \"Moral Coherence\" (MC-SCI values of 0.10 and 0.074). This is notable as it indicates that despite their opposing moral stances, neither character experiences significant internal conflict or contradiction between their expressed virtues and vices. Their moral frameworks, whether positive or negative, are internally consistent.\n\n## Thematic Analysis\n\nThe corpus, though small, presents a stark contrast in moral character and worldview.\n**Document 'document1.txt'** embodies a radical, revolutionary, and highly tribalistic perspective. Its core themes revolve around historical grievance, retribution, and the forceful re-establishment of power for a specific group. Virtues are largely absent or redefined to serve this agenda, while vices like Tribalism, Resentment, Manipulation, Fear, and Fantasy are highly salient and intense. The speaker's moral coherence stems from a consistent alignment with these dominant negative traits, rather than internal conflict.\n\n**Document 'document2.txt'** represents a progressive, inclusive, and reformist worldview. Its themes emphasize universal human dignity, truth, justice, hope, and pragmatic solutions. It actively rejects tribalism, resentment, and manipulation, focusing instead on collective action, systemic reform, and building a better future based on shared goals and human potential. This document exhibits a strong commitment to traditional virtues and a clear rejection of vices, leading to high moral clarity and coherence.\n\nIn essence, the corpus showcases two diametrically opposed approaches to societal change and moral engagement: one driven by division, retribution, and the subversion of universal values, and the other by inclusivity, progress, and the upholding of universal principles.\n\n## Detailed Results Table\n\n| Document | MC-SCI | Classification | Virtue Cluster Score | Vice Cluster Score | Character Balance | Moral Clarity | Salience Concentration |\n|----------|--------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| document1.txt | 0.100 | Moral Coherence | 0.420 | 0.790 | -0.37 | 0.37 | 0.32 |\n| document2.txt | 0.074 | Moral Coherence | 0.843 | 0.100 | 0.74 | 0.74 | 0.37 |\n\n## Mathematical Verification\n\nThe Character Assessment Framework v4.3 relies on precise mathematical calculations for its derived metrics. The LLM's ability to perform these calculations accurately is critical for the reliability of the analysis. Below are detailed steps for key calculations, demonstrating the LLM's adherence to the defined formulas.\n\n### Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI) Calculation (Example: document1.txt)\n\n**Formula:** `MC-SCI = (Sum of all Character Tension Scores) / Number of Opposing Pairs`\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n1.  **Calculate individual Character Tension Scores:**\n    *   **Dignity_Tribalism_Tension:**\n        *   `min(Virtue_score, Vice_score)`: min(0.2, 0.9) = 0.2\n        *   `|Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|`: |0.1 - 0.9| = |-0.8| = 0.8\n        *   Calculation: `0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16`\n        *   Result: `0.16`\n    *   **Truth_Manipulation_Tension:**\n        *   `min(Virtue_score, Vice_score)`: min(0.1, 0.7) = 0.1\n        *   `|Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|`: |0.1 - 0.7| = |-0.6| = 0.6\n        *   Calculation: `0.1 * 0.6 = 0.06`\n        *   Result: `0.06`\n    *   **Justice_Resentment_Tension:**\n        *   `min(Virtue_score, Vice_score)`: min(0.6, 0.9) = 0.6\n        *   `|Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|`: |0.7 - 0.9| = |-0.2| = 0.2\n        *   Calculation: `0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12`\n        *   Result: `0.12`\n    *   **Hope_Fear_Tension:**\n        *   `min(Virtue_score, Vice_score)`: min(0.2, 0.7) = 0.2\n        *   `|Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|`: |0.2 - 0.7| = |-0.5| = 0.5\n        *   Calculation: `0.2 * 0.5 = 0.10`\n        *   Result: `0.10`\n    *   **Pragmatism_Fantasy_Tension:**\n        *   `min(Virtue_score, Vice_score)`: min(0.1, 0.7) = 0.1\n        *   `|Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|`: |0.1 - 0.7| = |-0.6| = 0.6\n        *   Calculation: `0.1 * 0.6 = 0.06`\n        *   Result: `0.06`\n\n2.  **Sum of Tensions:** `0.16 + 0.06 + 0.12 + 0.10 + 0.06 = 0.50`\n3.  **Number of Opposing Pairs:** `5`\n4.  **Final MC-SCI Calculation:** `0.50 / 5 = 0.10`\n5.  **Result:** `0.10`\n6.  **Classification:** `Moral Coherence` (Thresholds: 0.00-0.10: Moral Coherence, 0.11-0.20: Character Complexity, 0.21-0.30: Character Ambivalence, 0.31+: Character Contradiction)\n\n### Character Salience Concentration (CSC) Calculation (Example: document1.txt)\n\n**Formula:** `CSC = Standard Deviation of all Character Salience Scores`\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n1.  **Salience Scores:** `[0.1, 0.1, 0.7, 0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7]`\n2.  **Mean (\u03bc):** `(0.1+0.1+0.7+0.2+0.1+0.9+0.9+0.7+0.7+0.7) / 10 = 5.1 / 10 = 0.51`\n3.  **Squared Differences from Mean (\u03a3(x\u1d62 - \u03bc)\u00b2):**\n    - (0.1-0.51)^2 = 0.1681\n    - (0.1-0.51)^2 = 0.1681\n    - (0.7-0.51)^2 = 0.0361\n    - (0.2-0.51)^2 = 0.0961\n    - (0.1-0.51)^2 = 0.1681\n    - (0.9-0.51)^2 = 0.1521\n    - (0.9-0.51)^2 = 0.1521\n    - (0.7-0.51)^2 = 0.0361\n    - (0.7-0.51)^2 = 0.0361\n    - (0.7-0.51)^2 = 0.0361\n4.  **Sum of Squared Differences:** `0.1681 + 0.1681 + 0.0361 + 0.0961 + 0.1681 + 0.1521 + 0.1521 + 0.0361 + 0.0361 + 0.0361 = 1.043`\n5.  **Variance (\u03c3\u00b2):** `1.043 / 10 = 0.1043`\n6.  **Standard Deviation (CSC):** `sqrt(0.1043) = 0.32295...`\n7.  **Result:** `0.32`\n8.  **Classification:** `Focused Character` (Thresholds: Low (<0.2): Broad character engagement, High (>0.3): Focused character priorities)",
