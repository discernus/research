The speaker exhibits a highly adversarial and revolutionary worldview, prioritizing group-specific retribution and power reversal over universal principles. The analysis reveals a strong emphasis on vices like Tribalism, Resentment, Manipulation, Fear, and Fantasy, while virtues like Dignity, Truth, Hope, and Pragmatism are largely absent or redefined in a negative, group-centric context. Justice is present but heavily skewed towards retribution. Despite the strong emphasis on vices, the Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI) indicates 'Moral Coherence' due to the consistent alignment of low virtue salience with low virtue intensity, and high vice salience with high vice intensity, minimizing internal tension between opposing traits. The character is highly focused on a few dominant traits, primarily vices.\",\n  \"document_analyses\": {\n    \"document1.txt\": {\n      \"worldview\": \"The speaker's worldview is one of radical, revolutionary change driven by historical grievance and a strict 'us vs. them' dichotomy.
