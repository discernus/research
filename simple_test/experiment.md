# Democratic Discourse Cohesion Study - v8.0

## Research Purpose
A comparative analysis of social cohesion patterns across four distinct approaches to democratic discourse: institutional gracious concession, populist progressive critique, populist conservative rhetoric, and populist progressive advocacy.

## Research Questions
1. Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion than populist styles?
2. Do populist progressive and conservative variants differ in social cohesion patterns?
3. What strategic contradictions emerge across different discourse types?
4. How do temporal factors (2008 vs 2017 vs 2025) influence cohesion patterns?

## Framework
**Path**: `cff_v8.md`
**Type**: Cohesive Flourishing Framework v8.0
**Focus**: Social cohesion analysis through 10 dimensions

## Corpus
**Path**: `corpus/`
**Documents**: 4 paradigmatic examples of American political communication
- John McCain 2008 concession speech (institutional)
- Bernie Sanders 2025 anti-oligarchy critique (populist progressive)
- Steve King 2017 cultural identity speech (populist conservative)  
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 2025 economic inequality address (populist progressive)

## Expected Outcomes
- **Statistical Analysis**: Social cohesion comparative analysis between institutional and populist discourse
- **Strategic Contradiction Analysis**: Rhetorical tension pattern measurement
- **Democratic Resilience Assessment**: Impact assessment across CFF dimensions
- **Quality Metrics**: Framework score extraction success rate > 95%

## Success Criteria
- Clear differentiation between institutional vs populist cohesion signatures
- Automated function generation for all CFF calculations
- Publication-ready visualizations and statistical reports
- Complete evidence integration linking scores to textual support
