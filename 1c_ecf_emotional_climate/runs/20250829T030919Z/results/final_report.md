## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the emotional climate in American political discourse, utilizing the Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v10.0. The study examines a corpus of eight speeches within a 2x3 factorial design (Ideology × Era), spanning from the Civil Rights Era (1963) to the contemporary Populist Era (2017-2025). Due to the preliminary nature of this pilot study and its small sample size (N=8), inferential statistics like ANOVA could not be performed; therefore, all findings are descriptive and should be considered indicative rather than conclusive.

The analysis reveals a significant and concerning trend: a dramatic shift towards a more negative and conflict-oriented emotional climate in recent political discourse. The data indicates that the Populist Era (2017-2025) is characterized by substantially higher levels of Fear, Enmity, and Envy compared to the Institutional Era (2008-2020). This is reflected in a sharp decline in the overall Emotional Climate Index (ECI), which moved from a balanced mean in the Institutional Era (*M* = 0.25) to a strongly negative one in the Populist Era (*M* = -0.37). This trend appears to transcend ideological lines, with both conservative and progressive speakers in the Populist Era contributing to this negative climate, albeit through different emotional emphases.

Key dimensional relationships validate the ECF's theoretical structure. A very strong negative correlation was found between Enmity and the overall Emotional Climate Index (*r* = -0.97), suggesting that the creation of an antagonistic atmosphere is the single most powerful driver of a negative emotional climate. Conversely, strong positive correlations between Hope and Amity (*r* = 0.87) and between the Positive Emotional Index and the ECI (*r* = 0.94) highlight the symbiotic relationship between constructive, optimistic language and a positive overall climate. Cluster analysis further identified distinct rhetorical archetypes: a "High-Amity" group (John McCain, Cory Booker) characterized by hope and cooperation, and a "High-Conflict" group (encompassing speakers from John Lewis to J.D. Vance) defined by high fear and enmity. These preliminary findings suggest the ECF is a robust tool for quantifying the psychological atmosphere of political discourse and tracking its evolution over time.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **A Shift Towards Pervasive Negativity**: The analysis indicates a stark shift in emotional climate from the Institutional Era (2008-2020) to the Populist Era (2017-2025). The average Social Relations Balance plummeted from a positive, amity-oriented score of +0.41 to a deeply negative, enmity-driven score of -0.69, suggesting a move from cooperative to conflict-oriented discourse.
*   **The Fear-Enmity Nexus**: Fear and Enmity are strongly linked (*r* = 0.79), indicating that discourse emphasizing threat and danger is highly likely to also create an antagonistic atmosphere toward opponents. This pattern is prominent in Populist Era speeches, such as J.D. Vance's warning that "The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more" (Source: `jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference.txt`).
*   **The Hope-Amity Synergy**: Hope and Amity are strongly correlated (*r* = 0.87), suggesting that optimistic, forward-looking discourse is intertwined with language that fosters cooperation and unity. This synergy is exemplified in John McCain's 2008 concession speech, where he urged supporters to "join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together" (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`).
*   **Emergence of Emotional Archetypes**: Cluster analysis identified distinct emotional profiles. A "High-Amity" cluster (McCain, Booker) is defined by high Hope (*M* = 0.83) and Amity (*M* = 0.90). In contrast, a large "High-Conflict" cluster (Lewis, Romney, Sanders, AOC, Vance) is characterized by high Fear (*M* = 0.82) and Enmity (*M* = 0.86). A third, outlier cluster represented by Steve King shows an extreme negative profile, with maximal Fear and Enmity and minimal positive emotion.
*   **The Rise of Grievance Politics**: Envy, defined as resentment toward others' advantages, is a powerful feature of the Populist Era, particularly in progressive discourse. Speeches by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez scored exceptionally high on Envy (*M* = 0.85), framing political conflict through a lens of grievance. As Ocasio-Cortez stated, "The last thing they want us to realize is that the division that is actually hurting our country the most is how endless greed is costing the lives of everyone else" (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`).
*   **The Scarcity of Compersion**: Across all eras and ideologies, Compersion—the celebration of others' success—was the least expressed emotion (*M* = 0.34). This suggests that political discourse broadly lacks an abundance-minded, supportive psychological state, even in speeches with an otherwise positive climate.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description

This analysis employed the Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v10.0, a computational tool designed to evaluate the psychological atmosphere generated by political discourse. Grounded in Affective Intelligence Theory and Social Identity Research, the ECF measures the emotional environment independent of specific rhetorical strategies or speaker characteristics.

The framework operates on three bipolar axes, comprising six fundamental emotional dimensions:
1.  **Threat-Opportunity Axis**: Measures the balance between **Fear** (danger, crisis) and **Hope** (possibility, progress).
2.  **Social Relations Axis**: Measures the balance between **Enmity** (antagonism, hostility) and **Amity** (cooperation, solidarity).
3.  **Resource Attitudes Axis**: Measures the balance between **Envy** (grievance, resentment) and **Compersion** (celebration of others' success).

A novel feature of the ECF is its use of **salience weighting**. Each dimension is scored for both raw intensity (0.0-1.0) and rhetorical salience (0.0-1.0), which measures its prominence and emphasis within the discourse. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of a speaker's strategic emotional priorities. From these scores, derived metrics such as the axis balances and a summary **Emotional Climate Index (ECI)** are calculated to provide a holistic assessment.

### Corpus and Data Structure

The analysis was conducted on a purpose-built corpus of 8 political speeches arranged in a 2×3 factorial design:
*   **Factor 1 (Ideology)**: Conservative (4 speeches), Progressive (4 speeches).
*   **Factor 2 (Era)**: Civil Rights (1963), Institutional (2008-2020), Populist (2017-2025).

This balanced design was intended to enable analysis of main effects and interaction effects between ideology and historical era. The speeches were selected to represent pivotal moments and prominent voices within each cell of the design.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations

The primary analytical methods were descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and k-means clustering. Mean scores for each of the six core dimensions and derived metrics were calculated and grouped by the experimental factors (era, ideology, and their interaction). A Pearson correlation matrix was generated to examine the relationships between all emotional dimensions and key indices. Finally, k-means clustering was used to identify natural groupings of speeches based on their six-dimensional emotional profiles.

A significant limitation of this study is its **small sample size (N=8)**. This size is insufficient for reliable inferential statistical tests such as a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), which failed to run due to cells with fewer than two observations. Consequently, this report does not make claims of statistical significance (e.g., p-values) and focuses exclusively on describing the patterns observed in the data. All findings should be interpreted as **preliminary and exploratory**, providing a foundation for future, larger-scale research.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics: A Temporal Shift to Negativity

Descriptive analysis of the emotional dimensions across political eras reveals a clear and dramatic trend toward a more negative and conflict-oriented climate. While the Institutional Era (2008-2020) presented a relatively balanced emotional profile, the Populist Era (2017-2025) is marked by a sharp increase in negative emotions and a corresponding decrease in positive ones.

**Table 1: Mean Emotional Climate Scores by Political Era**

| Metric                       | Institutional Era (2008-2020) | Populist Era (2017-2025) |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Fear (raw score)**         | 0.67                          | 0.85                       |
| **Hope (raw score)**         | 0.68                          | 0.40                       |
| **Enmity (raw score)**       | 0.37                          | 0.90                       |
| **Amity (raw score)**        | 0.80                          | 0.25                       |
| **Envy (raw score)**         | 0.17                          | 0.40                       |
| **Compersion (raw score)**   | 0.57                          | 0.40                       |
| **Threat-Opportunity Balance** | +0.01                         | -0.45                      |
| **Social Relations Balance**   | +0.41                         | -0.69                      |
| **Emotional Climate Index**  | +0.25                         | -0.37                      |
| **Negative Emotional Index** | 0.40                          | 0.72                       |
| **Positive Emotional Index** | 0.68                          | 0.35                       |

As shown in Table 1, the mean raw score for **Enmity** more than doubled, jumping from 0.37 in the Institutional Era to 0.90 in the Populist Era. Simultaneously, the mean **Amity** score fell from 0.80 to 0.25. This inversion is the most dramatic shift in the dataset and is captured by the `social_relations_balance` metric, which plummeted from a highly positive (amity-dominant) +0.41 to a deeply negative (enmity-dominant) -0.69.

This pattern of negativity extends to the Threat-Opportunity axis. While Hope and Fear were balanced in the Institutional Era, the Populist Era shows a rise in Fear (*M* = 0.85) and a decline in Hope (*M* = 0.40), resulting in a negative `threat_opportunity_balance` of -0.45. The overall effect is a stark reversal in the general emotional atmosphere, with the summary **Emotional Climate Index (ECI)** shifting from a positive +0.25 to a negative -0.37.

### 5.2 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The relationships between the emotional dimensions provide strong support for the ECF's theoretical constructs and reveal the underlying mechanics of emotional climate creation.

**Table 2: Key Inter-Dimensional Correlations (Pearson's *r*)**

| Dimension 1               | Dimension 2               | Correlation (*r*) | Interpretation                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enmity (raw score)**    | Emotional Climate Index   | -0.97             | Enmity is the strongest predictor of a negative climate. |
| **Positive Emotional Index** | Emotional Climate Index   | +0.94             | Positive emotions collectively drive a positive climate. |
| **Negative Emotional Index** | Emotional Climate Index   | -0.93             | Negative emotions collectively drive a negative climate. |
| **Hope (raw score)**      | Amity (raw score)         | +0.87             | Optimism and cooperation are strongly linked.       |
| **Fear (raw score)**      | Enmity (raw score)        | +0.79             | Threat and antagonism are strongly linked.          |
| **Enmity (raw score)**    | Envy (raw score)          | +0.76             | Hostility and grievance are strongly linked.        |
| **Envy (raw score)**      | Compersion (raw score)    | -0.78             | Grievance and celebration are strongly opposed.     |

The correlation matrix highlights several critical findings:

1.  **The Primacy of Enmity**: The extremely strong negative correlation between Enmity and the ECI (*r* = -0.97) is the most significant relationship in the dataset. This suggests that the presence of antagonistic, hostile language is the single most powerful factor in creating a negative psychological atmosphere, overwhelming other emotional content.
2.  **The Positive and Negative Poles**: The strong positive correlation between the Positive Emotional Index (Hope, Amity, Compersion) and the ECI (*r* = 0.94), paired with the strong negative correlation for the Negative Emotional Index (Fear, Enmity, Envy) (*r* = -0.93), validates the framework's core structure. It confirms that the ECI effectively summarizes the balance between these two opposing emotional poles.
3.  **Symbiotic Emotional Pairs**: The data reveals two powerful emotional pairings. The strong positive correlation between **Hope and Amity** (*r* = 0.87) suggests a "constructive" emotional strategy, where optimism is paired with calls for unity. Conversely, the strong positive correlation between **Fear and Enmity** (*r* = 0.79) indicates a "deconstructive" or "defensive" strategy, where threats are paired with the identification of an enemy.

### 5.3 Pattern Recognition: Rhetorical Archetypes

K-means clustering based on the six raw emotional scores revealed three distinct rhetorical archetypes within the corpus, demonstrating that speakers cluster based on emotional strategy rather than solely on ideology or era.

*   **Cluster 0: The High-Conflict Populists** (John Lewis, Mitt Romney, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, J.D. Vance). This was the largest cluster, defined by high average scores in Fear (*M* = 0.82), Enmity (*M* = 0.86), and Envy (*M* = 0.66). Despite spanning different eras and ideologies, these speeches share a common emotional foundation of threat, antagonism, and grievance. For example, John Lewis's 1963 speech, with its declaration that "All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!" (Source: `john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington.txt`), shares an emotional signature of high-stakes conflict with Bernie Sanders' 2025 speech decrying an oligarchic system where opponents "are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare" (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`).

*   **Cluster 1: The High-Amity Institutionalists** (John McCain, Cory Booker). This cluster is the emotional inverse of the first, characterized by high Hope (*M* = 0.83), high Amity (*M* = 0.90), and high Compersion (*M* = 0.85). These speeches create a positive, collaborative, and abundance-minded climate. Though from opposing parties, both speakers employed a strategy of unification. As Cory Booker stated, "We have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle" (Source: `cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt`). This mirrors the sentiment in John McCain's speech, which celebrated his opponent's success as something he "deeply admire[s] and commend[s] him for achieving" (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`).

*   **Cluster 2: The Extreme Negativity Outlier** (Steve King). This speech was so emotionally distinct it formed its own cluster. It is defined by maximum or near-maximum scores on Fear (*M* = 0.90) and Enmity (*M* = 0.90), coupled with minimal Hope (*M* = 0.10) and Amity (*M* = 0.10). This profile represents a purely antagonistic and threat-based climate, devoid of positive emotional appeals. The speech's focus on graphic threats, such as when King described how "This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`), exemplifies this extreme emotional strategy.

### 5.4 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The analysis suggests that the Emotional Climate Framework v10.0 is an effective tool for quantifying and differentiating the psychological atmospheres of political discourse.

*   **Discriminatory Power**: The framework successfully differentiated between speeches, revealing both broad temporal trends and specific rhetorical archetypes. The ability of the cluster analysis to group McCain and Booker, despite their ideological differences, demonstrates that the ECF captures a layer of emotional strategy that transcends partisan labels.
*   **Construct Validity**: The strong correlations observed align with the framework's theoretical underpinnings. The negative correlation between opposing dimensions (e.g., Envy and Compersion, *r* = -0.78) and the positive correlation between aligned dimensions (e.g., Fear and Enmity, *r* = 0.79) suggest the framework's dimensions are measuring distinct but related psychological constructs as intended.
*   **Salience Weighting**: The salience-weighted balance metrics, such as `social_relations_balance`, proved highly effective at capturing the overall tenor of a speech. For example, in John Lewis's speech, both Enmity (*salience* = 0.8) and Amity (*salience* = 0.2) were present, but the salience-weighted balance score of -0.68 accurately reflected that the dominant emotional emphasis was on conflict, not unity.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this preliminary analysis, while based on a limited sample, point toward several significant implications for the study of political communication. The most prominent finding is the descriptive evidence of a sharp negative turn in the emotional climate of American political discourse in the post-2016 Populist Era. This shift from a climate of balanced hope and fear and majority amity to one of dominant fear and enmity suggests a fundamental change in the psychological environment being created for political audiences.

This trend aligns with the predictions of Affective Intelligence Theory, which posits that emotional states alter how citizens process information. The high-fear, high-enmity climate of the Populist Era is likely to foster a "defensive" and "anxious" mode of political engagement, prioritizing threat detection over deliberative reasoning. In contrast, the more amity-driven climate of the Institutional Era speeches would be more conducive to constructive engagement and compromise. The data provides a quantitative fingerprint of this shift. As J.D. Vance frames the political landscape as a fight against those who have made society "poorer, less safe, less prosperous" (Source: `jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference.txt`), he cultivates a defensive psychological state. This stands in stark contrast to the constructive state fostered by Cory Booker's assertion that "we still live in a a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us" (Source: `cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt`).

Furthermore, the findings resonate with Social Identity Theory. The dramatic rise in Enmity and the corresponding fall in Amity suggest that political discourse is increasingly framed in terms of intergroup conflict ("us vs. them"). The emergence of Envy as a key dimension in progressive populist rhetoric, exemplified by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's focus on how "endless greed is costing the lives of everyone else" (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`), points to a specific form of social identity conflict rooted in economic grievance.

The identification of "High-Amity Institutionalist" and "High-Conflict Populist" archetypes suggests that emotional strategy may be a more fundamental organizing principle than party affiliation alone. The fact that a conservative (McCain) and a progressive (Booker) could share a common emotional profile centered on hope and unity indicates that this approach is not exclusive to one ideology. However, the prevalence of the high-conflict archetype in the Populist Era across both ideologies suggests that the strategic incentives for political communication may have shifted decisively toward conflict.

## 7. Conclusion

This report details a descriptive analysis of emotional climate patterns in American political discourse using the ECF v10.0. Despite the significant limitation of a small sample size, the analysis reveals a clear, indicative trend: a marked deterioration of the collective emotional climate from the Institutional Era to the Populist Era, characterized by a surge in Fear, Enmity, and Envy.

The study successfully demonstrates the utility of the ECF in quantifying complex psychological atmospheres. The framework's dimensional structure was validated by strong internal correlations, and its metrics effectively captured both overarching temporal shifts and distinct speaker archetypes. The findings suggest that the emotional texture of our political dialogue has coarsened, shifting from a language of cautious cooperation to one of pervasive conflict.

These preliminary results underscore the urgent need for larger-scale research. Future studies should expand the corpus to enable robust statistical testing of the interaction between ideology and era, track these emotional trajectories with greater granularity over time, and connect these climate patterns to real-world audience responses. Understanding the emotional climates we inhabit is a critical first step toward diagnosing and potentially improving the health of our democratic discourse.
