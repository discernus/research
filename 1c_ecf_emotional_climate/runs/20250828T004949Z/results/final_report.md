## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the emotional climates in American political discourse from 1963 to 2025, utilizing the Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v10.0. The study, based on a 2×3 factorial design (Ideology × Era), analyzed eight speeches from conservative and progressive figures across the Civil Rights, Institutional, and Populist eras. The preliminary findings from this pilot study indicate that political discourse organizes into distinct "emotional signatures" rather than following simple ideological or temporal divides.

The most significant finding is the identification of a potent, blended emotional climate characterized by high-intensity, conflict-oriented rhetoric. This climate, observed in populist-era speeches from both ideologies and in high-stakes historical activism, simultaneously leverages Hope and Amity for an in-group while directing Fear, Enmity, and Envy toward an out-group. This complex profile contrasts with more monolithic climates, such as a purely positive/collaborative style (e.g., John McCain's 2008 concession) or a purely negative/antagonistic one (e.g., Steve King's 2017 floor speech). Statistical analysis reveals strong, theoretically consistent correlations between emotional dimensions. Notably, Hope and Amity are strongly linked (raw score r = 0.87), as are Fear and Enmity (r = 0.79). Furthermore, Enmity shows a strong inverse relationship with Compersion (salience r = -0.76), suggesting that a focus on adversaries systematically precludes the celebration of others' success.

The ECF v10.0 framework proved effective in quantifying these complex psychological environments. Its novel distinction between emotional intensity (raw score) and rhetorical prominence (salience) provided a nuanced view of strategic communication. While the small sample size (N=8) means these findings should be considered indicative rather than definitive, they point toward a critical shift in political communication. The data suggests that the most energetic forms of modern political discourse are not merely negative but are defined by a high-intensity fusion of hope and conflict, a finding with significant implications for understanding political polarization, mobilization, and democratic health.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

- **Political Rhetoric Clusters into "Emotional Signatures":** The analysis identified at least three distinct emotional profiles in political discourse: a 'Positive/Collaborative' climate (high Hope, Amity, Compersion), a 'Negative/Antagonistic' climate (high Fear, Enmity), and a 'Mixed High-Intensity/Conflict' climate that blends positive and negative emotions. This suggests that the psychological environment created by a speech is a more robust classifier than ideology or era alone.

- **The Positive Axis: Hope and Amity are Deeply Intertwined:** The data shows a very strong positive correlation between the intensity of Hope and Amity (r = 0.87). This indicates that optimistic political visions are typically constructed upon a foundation of unity and shared purpose. As Cory Booker argued for bipartisan legislation, "We have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle" (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt).

- **The Negative Triad: Fear, Enmity, and Envy Form a Cohesive Strategy:** The analysis reveals strong positive correlations between Fear and Enmity (r = 0.79) and between Enmity and Envy (r = 0.76). This suggests a powerful rhetorical strategy that links perceived threats to a specific enemy and fuels the conflict with a sense of grievance. For example, Bernie Sanders’ critique of a "rigged economy" where a "$75 trillion transfer of wealth" occurred exemplifies the link between Envy and Enmity (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

- **The Centrality of Conflict: Enmity is Incompatible with Compersion:** The strongest negative correlations were found between Enmity and Compersion (celebrating others' success), both in raw intensity (r = -0.73) and rhetorical salience (r = -0.76). This stark trade-off suggests that building a political message around an enemy makes it rhetorically and psychologically difficult to create a supportive, abundance-minded atmosphere.

- **Compersion is a Rare Political Emotion:** Across the entire corpus, Compersion was the least prevalent emotion. Its near-absence, except in unique contexts like a concession speech, indicates that modern political discourse prioritizes grievance and conflict over the celebration of mutual or opponents' success, potentially contributing to a zero-sum political mindset.

- **A "High-Intensity Conflict" Climate Defines Modern Populism and Activism:** A key cluster of speeches (from Lewis, Booker, Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Vance) is characterized by high scores across almost all dimensions—positive and negative. This suggests that a defining feature of modern populist rhetoric and historical high-stakes activism is the blending of a hopeful vision for "us" with an antagonistic, fear-based narrative about "them."

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description

This analysis employed the **Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v10.0**, a computational tool designed to measure the psychological atmosphere generated by political discourse. The ECF evaluates text along three bipolar axes, comprising six fundamental emotional dimensions:

1.  **Threat-Opportunity Axis:** Measures the balance between **Fear** (language of danger, crisis) and **Hope** (language of possibility, progress).
2.  **Social Relations Axis:** Measures the balance between **Enmity** (antagonistic, hostile language) and **Amity** (cooperative, unifying language).
3.  **Resource Attitudes Axis:** Measures the balance between **Envy** (grievance, resentment of others' success) and **Compersion** (celebration of others' success).

A core innovation of the ECF is its dual-track analysis, which independently scores each dimension for **raw intensity** (0.0-1.0) and **salience** (0.0-1.0). Salience measures the rhetorical prominence or strategic emphasis a speaker places on an emotion, allowing for a more nuanced understanding beyond mere intensity. The framework calculates several derived metrics, including axis-level balances and a summary **Emotional Climate Index**, to provide a holistic assessment.

### Corpus and Data Structure

The analysis was conducted on a purpose-built corpus of 8 political speeches arranged in a 2×3 factorial design:
-   **Factor 1 (Ideology):** Progressive (4 speeches), Conservative (4 speeches).
-   **Factor 2 (Era):** Civil Rights (1963), Institutional (2008-2020), Populist (2017-2025).

This balanced design was intended to test for main effects of ideology and era, as well as their interaction effects on the emotional climate. Speeches were selected from prominent figures (e.g., John Lewis, John McCain, Bernie Sanders, JD Vance) to represent these categories.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations

The primary statistical method presented in this report is Pearson correlation analysis, used to identify relationships between the six core emotional dimensions for both raw scores and salience scores. The analysis also draws upon pre-computed cluster analysis findings provided in the evidence packet to identify recurring emotional profiles.

It is critical to acknowledge the limitations of the provided statistical output. The automated analysis pipeline failed to generate descriptive statistics, two-way ANOVA results, and a direct K-Means clustering output, citing missing data or invalid parameters. Consequently, this report cannot comment on statistical significance for differences between groups (ideology/era) and relies on the successful correlation analysis and the curated evidence packet for its primary findings. All conclusions drawn from this small (N=8) pilot study should be considered preliminary and suggestive, intended to generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research. A minor data inconsistency was noted where the dimension `compersion` was labeled `compassion` in the statistical output; for this analysis, they were treated as synonymous based on the framework specification.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Dimensional Patterns and Correlations

While a full descriptive statistics table was not generated, the correlation analysis and evidence packet reveal significant patterns in the relationships between emotional dimensions. These correlations provide strong evidence for the ECF's construct validity, as related concepts cluster together and opposing concepts show negative relationships.

#### The Architecture of Positive Climates: The Hope-Amity Synergy

The analysis revealed a powerful, positive relationship between Hope and Amity. The correlation between their raw intensity scores was exceptionally strong (r = 0.87), with a similarly strong correlation for their rhetorical salience (r = 0.73). This indicates that political messages aiming to create an optimistic, forward-looking psychological state are structurally reliant on language of unity, cooperation, and shared identity.

This pattern is clearly visible in speeches from the Institutional era. For example, in his 2008 concession speech, John McCain masterfully wove together themes of hope and unity, urging Americans "to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). This hopeful message was paired with expressions of Amity, as he called on his supporters to join him in offering goodwill to his opponent. Similarly, Cory Booker’s 2018 speech in support of the First Step Act built a hopeful case for reform on a foundation of bipartisan collaboration, stating, "We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us" (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt). These examples illustrate that, rhetorically, hope is not an isolated emotion but is activated through appeals to collective identity and cooperation.

#### The Architecture of Negative Climates: The Fear-Enmity-Envy Triad

Conversely, the data indicates that negative emotional climates are built around a triad of Fear, Enmity, and Envy. The analysis found a strong positive correlation between the raw scores of Fear and Enmity (r = 0.79), suggesting that the creation of a threat is intrinsically linked to the identification of an enemy responsible for it. This was a prominent feature in populist-era speeches. JD Vance, for instance, framed immigration not as a policy issue but as an existential danger, stating, "The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more" (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference.txt), directly linking a threat (to democracy) with an antagonistic group (politicians).

This dynamic is further intensified by the strong positive correlation between the raw scores of Enmity and Envy (r = 0.76). This suggests that hostility towards an out-group is often fueled by a narrative of grievance and unfairness. Progressive populist speeches demonstrated this link clearly. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez identified an enemy—an oligarchy—and connected it to a core grievance: "The last thing they want us to realize is that the division that is actually hurting our country the most is how endless greed is costing the lives of everyone else" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This fusion of an enemy (`enmity`) with resentment over their advantages (`envy`) creates a potent, conflict-oriented psychological state.

### 5.2 Cross-Axis Dynamics: The Enmity-Compersion Opposition

The most telling cross-axis relationship is the strong, negative correlation between Enmity and Compersion. This opposition was robust across both raw scores (r = -0.73) and, even more starkly, salience scores (r = -0.76). This finding suggests a fundamental principle of emotional climate construction: a speaker who strategically emphasizes an enemy (`enmity_salience`) systematically de-emphasizes or ignores the celebration of others' success (`compersion_salience`).

This dynamic explains the overall rarity of Compersion in the corpus. The only speech with a high Compersion score was John McCain's concession, a unique political context that requires the gracious acknowledgement of an opponent's victory. He stated, "But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans... is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). This stands in sharp contrast to the high-Enmity speeches, which contained no such language. The data indicates that Enmity-based rhetoric creates a zero-sum psychological environment where another's success cannot be acknowledged as legitimate or worthy of celebration. This finding has profound implications for understanding political polarization, as it suggests that an emphasis on political combat actively suppresses the emotional capacity for finding common ground or acknowledging shared achievements.

### 5.3 Emotional Climate Clusters and Archetypes

Based on the evidence provided, the speeches in the corpus group into three distinct emotional archetypes, which appear to be driven more by strategic intent and political context than by ideology or era alone.

1.  **Cluster 0: 'Negative/Antagonistic' Climate.** Characterized by high Fear and Enmity with a near-total absence of positive emotions. This climate is purely oppositional and threat-focused. Speeches by Mitt Romney on impeachment and Steve King on immigration fall into this category. King's speech, for example, is dominated by visceral threat narratives—"This illegal alien beat this boy to death... and burned his body" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt)—and directed Enmity, creating a stark, defensive psychological state.

2.  **Cluster 2: 'Positive/Collaborative' Climate.** This is the mirror opposite of the first cluster, defined by high Hope, Amity, and Compersion, with minimal negative emotion. John McCain's concession speech is the exemplar of this climate, built around national unity and graciousness. This archetype appears to be reserved for specific institutional moments that demand cross-party appeals.

3.  **Cluster 1: 'Mixed High-Intensity / Conflict-Oriented' Climate.** This is the most complex and perhaps most significant cluster. It is defined by high intensity across *both* positive and negative dimensions, particularly Hope, Fear, Enmity, and Envy. This archetype includes speeches from John Lewis (Civil Rights), Cory Booker (Institutional), and the populist-era figures Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Vance. This climate is not simply positive or negative; it is a rhetoric of righteous struggle. It combines a hopeful vision for an in-group with a narrative of threat and hostility toward an out-group. John Lewis's 1963 speech embodies this, pairing a hopeful vision—"we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy" (Source: john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington.txt)—with fierce opposition to the existing power structure. This blended, high-energy climate appears to be the signature style of transformative political movements and modern populism.

## 6. Discussion

The preliminary findings of this analysis offer several important insights into the nature of emotional climates in American political discourse. The core takeaway is that political communication strategies can be effectively mapped as distinct "emotional signatures," with the 'Mixed High-Intensity/Conflict' climate emerging as a particularly potent and prevalent archetype in contemporary politics.

The existence of this blended climate challenges simplistic models of political communication that equate populism or negativity with a monolithic use of fear and anger. Instead, this analysis suggests a more sophisticated strategy is at play: one that mobilizes followers by wedding a hopeful, unifying message for the in-group to a narrative of grievance, threat, and enmity directed at an out-group. This dual-front emotional appeal may be particularly effective at fostering high levels of engagement and polarization simultaneously. The fact that this signature is shared by a Civil Rights icon like John Lewis and modern populists from both the left and right suggests it is a functional strategy for movements seeking radical change against a perceived hostile establishment.

Furthermore, the stark trade-off between Enmity and Compersion is a critical finding. The data strongly indicates that as political discourse becomes more centered on conflict and opposition, it loses the capacity for acknowledging shared success or the legitimacy of opponents. The near-absence of Compersion in the corpus, outside of a formal concession, may be a quantitative indicator of a decaying political culture, one where zero-sum thinking has supplanted the potential for positive-sum collaboration. This has significant implications for democratic health, as a political environment devoid of Compersion is unlikely to find sustainable, bipartisan solutions to complex problems.

The study's limitations, particularly the small sample size and the failure of the ANOVA tests, prevent definitive conclusions about the causal effects of ideology and era. However, the cluster patterns suggest that the *interaction* between these factors is more revealing than either in isolation. For example, the Institutional era produced both the most purely positive (McCain) and purely negative (Romney, King) climates, while the Populist era is dominated by the 'Mixed High-Intensity' climate. This suggests that political eras may enable or constrain certain emotional strategies, which are then adopted by speakers based on their goals.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though preliminary, successfully demonstrates the utility of the Emotional Climate Framework v10.0 in identifying and quantifying the complex psychological environments created by political discourse. The study moves beyond simple positive/negative sentiment analysis to reveal the structural relationships between distinct emotions and the recurring "emotional signatures" that define different political strategies.

The key contribution of this report is the identification of a 'Mixed High-Intensity/Conflict' climate as a defining feature of modern populist and historical activist rhetoric. This blended strategy, which combines in-group hope with out-group enmity, provides a more nuanced model for understanding political mobilization and polarization. The analysis also highlights the fundamental tension between Enmity and Compersion, suggesting that the prevalence of conflict-oriented rhetoric systematically erodes the emotional foundation for collaboration and mutual respect.

While these findings require validation with a larger and more diverse corpus, they provide a robust, data-driven foundation for future research. Future studies should apply this framework at scale to track the evolution of these emotional climates over time, assess their prevalence across different media platforms, and investigate their causal impact on audience attitudes and behaviors. By mapping the emotional terrain of our political discourse, we can better understand the psychological forces shaping our democracy.
