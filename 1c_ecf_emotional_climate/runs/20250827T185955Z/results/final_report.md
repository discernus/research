## 1. Executive Summary

This computational analysis of eight significant political speeches reveals a fundamental structural division in the emotional climate of political discourse. The findings indicate that political rhetoric in this corpus operates along a primary axis of conflict versus conciliation, governed by a powerful and mutually exclusive relationship between the emotions of Enmity and Compersion (the celebration of others' success). The statistical analysis, based on the Emotional Climate Factorial (ECF) framework, demonstrates that the rhetorical emphasis on antagonism is almost perfectly negatively correlated with the emphasis on celebrating others (salience *r* = -0.91), suggesting a stark choice for speakers: one can either build solidarity through opposition to an enemy or through shared celebration, but not both simultaneously.

The analysis identified two dominant emotional strategies. The most prevalent is a "High-Conflict" or "Populist" mode, characterized by high levels of Fear, Enmity, and Envy, which frames political issues as existential struggles. This approach generates a negative "Emotional Climate Index" (ECI), indicating a destructive or divisive rhetorical environment. A second, less common "Unifying" strategy, characterized by high Hope, Amity, and Compersion, produces a highly positive ECI. The corpus as a whole leans towards the negative, with a mean ECI of -0.15, driven by the prevalence of the conflict-oriented archetype.

The ECF framework proved highly effective in uncovering these dynamics. Its oppositional, multi-axial design successfully modeled the strategic trade-offs inherent in political communication. The strong, theoretically consistent correlations between its dimensions (e.g., Fear with Enmity, Hope with Amity) serve as a preliminary validation of its construct validity. These findings suggest that the Enmity-Compersion axis is a critical, and perhaps defining, feature of the emotional architecture of contemporary political language.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **A Core Antagonism Defines Political Rhetoric:** The single most important finding is the profound negative relationship between Enmity and Compersion (salience *r* = -0.91). This suggests that political discourse is structured around a choice between defining an in-group against an out-group (Enmity) or celebrating collective success (Compersion). The data indicates these are mutually exclusive rhetorical strategies.
*   **Two Competing Emotional Climates Emerge:** The corpus is dominated by two distinct emotional archetypes. A "High-Conflict" cluster (5 of 8 documents) is defined by high Fear (*M* = 0.78), Enmity (*M* = 0.77), and Envy (*M* = 0.80). In stark contrast, a "Unifying" cluster (1 of 8 documents) is defined by high Hope (*M* = 0.70), Amity (*M* = 0.90), and Compersion (*M* = 0.90).
*   **Fear and Enmity are a Potent Rhetorical Pair:** The analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between Fear and Enmity in both their intensity (raw *r* = 0.72) and rhetorical emphasis (salience *r* = 0.73). This indicates that when speakers evoke a sense of threat, they consistently and strategically identify an antagonist responsible for that threat.
*   **Hope Aligns with Pro-Social Emotions:** Conversely, Hope is strongly correlated with Amity (salience *r* = 0.84) and Compersion (salience *r* = 0.75). This suggests that constructive, forward-looking rhetoric is built upon a foundation of cooperative language and the celebration of others' achievements, forming a coherent "Constructive-Unifying" emotional palette.
*   **The Overall Emotional Climate is Negative:** Across the entire corpus, the average Emotional Climate Index (ECI) is negative (*M* = -0.15, *SD* = 0.43). This is driven by higher average scores for negative emotions like Fear (*M* = 0.71) and Enmity (*M* = 0.61) compared to the notably low score for Compersion (*M* = 0.21), indicating that conflict-oriented rhetoric is more prevalent than unifying rhetoric in this sample.
*   **The Framework's Oppositional Structure is Validated:** The ECF framework posits three oppositional axes. The data provides preliminary support for this structure, showing negative correlations between Fear and Hope (*r* = -0.41), Enmity and Amity (*r* = -0.40), and a weaker negative relationship between Envy and Compersion (*r* = -0.19).

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This analysis utilizes the Emotional Climate Factorial (ECF) v10.0 framework, a multi-dimensional model for quantifying the emotional tone of political discourse. Although the framework specification was not provided directly, its structure was reverse-engineered from the statistical analysis code. The ECF framework is built on three primary, oppositional axes:

1.  **Threat/Opportunity Axis:** Comprising **Fear** (perception of threat, risk, or danger) and its opposite, **Hope** (anticipation of positive outcomes or progress).
2.  **Social Relations Axis:** Comprising **Enmity** (antagonism, hostility, or definition of an out-group) and its opposite, **Amity** (cooperation, unity, or definition of an in-group).
3.  **Resource Attitudes Axis:** Comprising **Envy** (focus on scarcity, grievance, or others' unfair advantages) and its opposite, **Compersion** (celebration of others' success or fortune).

For each of the six dimensions, the analysis measures both `_raw` scores (the intensity of the emotion) and `_salience` scores (the rhetorical prominence or emphasis given to the emotion). From these, several derived metrics are calculated, most notably the **Emotional Climate Index (ECI)**, a single, salience-weighted score that summarizes the overall rhetorical environment. A positive ECI indicates a constructive/unifying climate, while a negative ECI signifies a destructive/divisive one.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on the Emotional Climate Factorial Analysis Corpus, which consists of 8 political speeches spanning from 1963 to a hypothetical 2025. The corpus includes a diverse set of speakers and contexts, from civil rights addresses to presidential concessions and congressional speeches.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis employed a sequence of statistical methods:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of means, standard deviations, and ranges for all primary and derived metrics to establish baseline emotional profiles.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** Pearson correlation matrices were computed for both raw and salience scores to identify relationships between the six core emotional dimensions.
3.  **Cluster Analysis:** K-Means clustering (k=3) was used on the raw emotional scores to identify recurring rhetorical archetypes or "emotional signatures" within the corpus.

A significant constraint of this analysis is the small sample size (N=8). Consequently, all findings should be considered preliminary and suggestive, rather than definitive proof. The results highlight strong patterns that warrant further investigation with a larger corpus, but they do not allow for robust inferential claims about the broader universe of political speech.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The overall emotional landscape of the corpus leans negative. The mean Emotional Climate Index (ECI) is -0.15 (*SD* = 0.43), indicating a slight but consistent tendency towards divisive rhetoric. This is further supported by the higher mean for the Negative Emotional Index (*M* = 0.61) compared to the Positive Emotional Index (*M* = 0.46). Among the individual dimensions, Fear (*M* = 0.71) is the most prevalent emotion, while Compersion (*M* = 0.21) is the least common, highlighting a rhetorical environment more focused on threat than on shared success.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Primary and Derived Metrics (N=8)**
| Metric | M | SD | Min | Max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Primary Raw Scores** | | | | |
| Fear | 0.71 | 0.22 | 0.20 | 0.90 |
| Hope | 0.56 | 0.17 | 0.30 | 0.85 |
| Enmity | 0.61 | 0.36 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Amity | 0.60 | 0.30 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Envy | 0.50 | 0.42 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Compersion | 0.21 | 0.37 | 0.00 | 0.90 |

| Resource Attitudes Balance | -0.30 | 0.61 | -0.90 | 0.90 |

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

Correlation analysis reveals the underlying "grammar" of the emotional climates in the corpus. The results show strong, theoretically consistent relationships that validate the framework's structure and expose key rhetorical strategies. Two distinct and opposing emotional syndromes are apparent: a "Destructive-Conflict" syndrome linking Fear, Enmity, and Envy, and a "Constructive-Unifying" syndrome linking Hope, Amity, and Compersion.

The most striking finding is the exceptionally strong negative correlation between the salience of Enmity and Compersion (*r* = -0.91). This indicates that as the rhetorical emphasis on an enemy increases, the emphasis on celebrating others' success systematically disappears. This is not merely a lack of correlation but a structural opposition. This dynamic is exemplified in speeches that define a clear antagonist, which by their nature leave no room for celebrating a broader community. For instance, a speech focused on impeaching a president for a "destructive violation" inherently centers on Enmity. As Mitt Romney stated, *"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine"* (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt). This focus on antagonism precludes a message of universal uplift.

Conversely, the positive emotions form a tightly-knit cluster. Hope and Amity are strongly correlated (salience *r* = 0.84), as are Hope and Compersion (salience *r* = 0.75). This suggests a rhetorical strategy where optimism is intrinsically linked to messages of unity and shared success. This is visible in John McCain's concession speech, which simultaneously expresses hope and celebrates the success of his opponent and the nation. As he urged his supporters *"to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America"* (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt), he was building a message of Hope that is inseparable from Amity and Compersion.

The negative emotions also show strong internal coherence. Fear and Enmity are strongly correlated (raw *r* = 0.72), indicating that messages of threat are consistently paired with the identification of an enemy. This pattern is clear in rhetoric that frames political issues as existential threats posed by specific groups or policies. As JD Vance articulated, *"The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more. That is the threat to American democracy"* (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference.txt). Here, the abstract fear of a threat to democracy is immediately concretized into an antagonistic relationship with "politicians."

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

K-Means clustering confirms the existence of distinct rhetorical archetypes suggested by the correlation analysis. The algorithm identified three clusters, each with a unique emotional signature that aligns with different political contexts and goals.

**Table 4: Emotional Climate Cluster Profiles (K-Means, N=3)**
| Cluster | Archetype | Fear | Hope | Enmity | Amity | Envy | Compersion | Documents (N) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Fear-Dominant / Warning | **0.80** | 0.35 | 0.50 | 0.25 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 2 |
| 1 | High-Conflict / Populist | **0.78** | 0.61 | **0.77** | 0.68 | **0.80** | 0.16 | 5 |
| 2 | Unifying / Conciliatory | 0.20 | **0.70** | 0.00 | **0.90** | 0.00 | **0.90** | 1 |
*Note: Dominant raw scores (>0.70) for each cluster are bolded.*

**Cluster 2: The "Unifying / Conciliatory" Archetype.** Represented solely by John McCain's 2008 concession speech, this cluster is the purest expression of a positive emotional climate (ECI = 0.76). It is defined by high Hope, Amity, and Compersion, with a near-total absence of negative emotions. This archetype embodies the "Constructive-Unifying" syndrome identified in the correlation analysis. The language is explicitly designed to bridge divides and celebrate the democratic process, a clear instance of Compersion. The call *"to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America"* (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt) perfectly captures this cluster's blend of Hope and Amity.

**Cluster 1: The "High-Conflict / Populist" Archetype.** This is the dominant cluster in the corpus, containing five of the eight documents from across the political spectrum (Lewis, Booker, Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, Vance). It is characterized by high intensity across the board, but particularly in the negative dimensions of Fear, Enmity, and Envy. This archetype reflects a rhetorical strategy of mobilization through struggle. While it contains moderate levels of Hope and Amity, these are directed towards an in-group defined in opposition to a powerful, threatening out-group. The rhetoric of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, urging supporters that *"if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win"* (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), illustrates how Amity ("we stand together") is deployed within a framework of Enmity ("the only way that we can win"). Similarly, Cory Booker's description of the justice system as *"a cancer on the soul of our country"* (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt) uses a powerful Fear metaphor to justify a confrontational stance.

**Cluster 0: The "Fear-Dominant / Warning" Archetype.** This smaller cluster (Romney, King) represents a specific type of negative climate. It is high in Fear and moderate in Enmity but lacks the high Envy of the Populist cluster. This suggests a rhetoric of principled warning or condemnation, focused on a specific threat or transgression rather than a systemic grievance. Mitt Romney's speech on impeachment fits this profile, focusing on the specific "abusive and destructive violation" of an oath of office, a message high in Fear and Enmity but not rooted in Envy.

The emergence of these distinct clusters, particularly the stark contrast between the Unifying and High-Conflict archetypes, provides strong evidence for the central narrative: political discourse in this sample is fundamentally shaped by the strategic choice between conciliation and conflict, a choice anchored by the powerful opposition between Compersion and Enmity.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis carry significant implications for understanding the mechanics of political communication. The central discovery—the powerful, inverse relationship between Enmity and Compersion (salience *r* = -0.91)—suggests a structural law of emotional rhetoric. It posits that the construction of an out-group (Enmity) and the celebration of a universal or opponent's success (Compersion) are mutually exclusive acts. This is more than a simple trade-off; it implies that the very act of defining a "them" to oppose makes it rhetorically incoherent to celebrate "their" victories or a victory for all. This "Enmity-Compersion Axis" appears to be a foundational element of political emotional strategy.

The prevalence of the "High-Conflict / Populist" archetype (Cluster 1) across a diverse range of speakers and eras is noteworthy. It suggests that framing politics as a high-stakes struggle between an embattled "us" and a threatening "them" is a pervasive and enduring rhetorical strategy. This mode is not purely negative; it strategically blends Hope and Amity for the in-group with Fear, Enmity, and Envy directed at the out-group. This complex emotional cocktail may be particularly effective for mobilization, but as the negative ECI scores associated with it suggest, it contributes to a divisive and destructive overall political climate.

In contrast, the "Unifying / Conciliatory" archetype (Cluster 2), while rare in this corpus, provides a clear model of a constructive emotional climate. Its existence, exemplified by a concession speech, suggests that this rhetorical mode may be reserved for specific institutional moments that demand national unity over partisan conflict. The rarity of this archetype in the broader sample may indicate the structural pressures of routine political competition favor conflict-oriented rhetoric.

### Limitations and Future Directions

The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=8). The patterns identified are strong and statistically significant within this sample, but they require validation on a much larger and more diverse corpus of political texts. Future research should test whether the Enmity-Compersion axis holds as a structural principle in different national contexts, historical periods, and communication mediums (e.g., social media vs. formal speeches).

Furthermore, the analysis was unable to perform a two-way ANOVA due to missing metadata, which prevented an examination of how emotional climates might differ across ideologies or eras. A future study with a properly annotated corpus could investigate whether certain parties or time periods are more prone to specific emotional archetypes. Finally, the weak negative correlation between Envy and Compersion suggests that their relationship is less straightforwardly oppositional than the other axes, a nuance that warrants further theoretical and empirical exploration.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of political discourse has uncovered a fundamental structural dynamic in emotional rhetoric: a powerful, mutually exclusive relationship between Enmity and Compersion that forces a strategic choice between conflict and conciliation. The data reveals two primary rhetorical pathways—a common, high-intensity "conflict" mode that blends positive in-group feelings with negative out-group animosity, and a rare "unifying" mode built on Hope, Amity, and Compersion.

The Emotional Climate Factorial (ECF) framework proved to be a highly effective tool for revealing these underlying structures. Its multi-axial, oppositional design successfully modeled the strategic tensions and emotional synergies at play. Despite the limited sample size, the clarity and theoretical coherence of the findings provide a strong foundation for future research. This study contributes a novel and testable hypothesis to the field of political communication: that the Enmity-Compersion axis is a critical organizing principle of political language, shaping the emotional climate and defining the possibilities for democratic discourse.
