# Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v10.0

## Abstract & Raison d'Être

The Emotional Climate Framework provides a systematic approach to evaluating the emotional atmosphere generated by political discourse through analysis of six fundamental emotional dimensions that shape the psychological environment for audiences. Drawing on affective intelligence theory and social identity research, this framework measures the psychological environment that discourse generates, independent of rhetorical strategy, speaker character, or institutional effects.

Political discourse creates emotional climates that profoundly influence how audiences process information, make decisions, and engage with democratic processes. These emotional atmospheres can either facilitate constructive democratic dialogue or contribute to polarization and dysfunction. This framework provides a rigorous methodology for measuring the psychological environment created by political communication, independent of rhetorical strategy or speaker character.

This framework is intended for political psychologists, communication researchers, campaign strategists, journalists, and policy analysts monitoring emotional climate and psychological atmosphere in political discourse across different platforms and contexts.

## Theoretical & Empirical Foundations

### Affective Intelligence Theory

Building on Marcus, Neuman, and MacKuen's *Affective Intelligence and Political Judgment* (2000), this framework recognizes that emotions drive political behavior beyond rational evaluation. Emotional states fundamentally alter how audiences process political information and make decisions.

**Core Innovation**: Emotional climate exists independently of other discourse factors. Same emotional patterns appear across different rhetorical strategies, speakers, and institutional contexts.

### Social Identity Research

Tajfel and Turner's Social Identity Theory demonstrates how group-based emotions influence political behavior and attitude formation. The framework's relational dimensions (enmity/amity) capture these group emotional dynamics.

**Key Insight**: Emotional climates are not merely individual responses but collective psychological environments that shape group behavior and political engagement.

### Persuasion and Communication Studies

Research by Petty and Cacioppo on the Elaboration Likelihood Model shows how emotional states influence information processing routes. The framework's threat-opportunity axis captures these fundamental emotional processing patterns.

**Critical Understanding**: Emotional climates determine not just what audiences feel, but how they think about political information.

### The Importance of Salience Weighting

Building on political communication research, this framework recognizes that speakers make strategic choices about which emotional dimensions to emphasize. A speaker might demonstrate moderate Hope consistently throughout their discourse, while only briefly expressing Fear in one section. The Hope has much higher **salience** (rhetorical prominence) than Fear despite potentially lower raw intensity.

**Academic Foundation**: Emotional emphasis patterns reveal strategic priorities and likely audience responses, enabling more sophisticated understanding of emotional climate creation through priority-aware analysis.

## Analytical Methodology

### Six-Dimensional Emotional Climate

The framework evaluates political discourse across three bipolar axes that form the foundation of emotional climate:

#### Threat-Opportunity Axis: Fear ↔ Hope
- **Fear (0.0-1.0)**: Language emphasizing danger, threat, vulnerability, crisis, or existential risk that creates anxiety and defensive psychological states
- **Hope (0.0-1.0)**: Language emphasizing positive possibilities, progress, improvement, or achievement potential that creates optimistic and constructive psychological states

#### Social Relations Axis: Enmity ↔ Amity  
- **Enmity (0.0-1.0)**: Language creating antagonistic atmosphere toward opponents, enemies, or opposing groups that fosters hostility and conflict orientation
- **Amity (0.0-1.0)**: Language fostering positive relationships, cooperation, solidarity, or shared purpose that creates collaborative and inclusive psychological states

#### Resource Attitudes Axis: Envy ↔ Compersion
- **Envy (0.0-1.0)**: Language expressing resentment toward others' advantages, success, or privileged positions that creates zero-sum and grievance-based psychological states
- **Compersion (0.0-1.0)**: Language celebrating others' success, merit, achievement, or positive developments that creates abundance-minded and supportive psychological states

### Salience-Weighted Emotional Analysis

**Salience** measures how much rhetorical emphasis the speaker places on each emotional dimension, regardless of raw intensity scores. This dual-track analysis captures both the emotional climate created AND the speaker's emotional priorities and strategic emphasis patterns.

**Enhanced Emotional Intelligence**:
- **Emotional Priorities**: Reveals which emotional dimensions speakers prioritize in their psychological strategy
- **Strategic Emotional Discourse**: Shows which emotional states speakers invest the most rhetorical effort in creating
- **Authentic Climate Analysis**: Uses actual emotional emphasis rather than researcher assumptions about dimension importance

### Emotional Climate Indices

The framework calculates several derived metrics to provide comprehensive emotional climate assessment:

**Axis-Level Climate Indices**:
- **Threat-Opportunity Balance**: Measures overall hope vs. fear orientation, weighted by salience
- **Social Relations Balance**: Measures overall amity vs. enmity orientation, weighted by salience  
- **Resource Attitudes Balance**: Measures overall compersion vs. envy orientation, weighted by salience

**Summary Metrics**:
- **Emotional Climate Index**: Primary summary metric measuring overall emotional climate orientation, weighted by rhetorical prominence
- **Climate Intensity**: Measures overall emotional intensity across all dimensions
- **Positive Emotional Index**: Measures positive emotional atmosphere (hope, amity, compersion)
- **Negative Emotional Index**: Measures negative emotional atmosphere (fear, enmity, envy)

### Sequential Analysis Strategy

For highest fidelity analysis, it is recommended to run the three sequential analysis variants (sequential_threat_opportunity, sequential_social_relations, sequential_resource_attitudes) and combine the results. This approach allows the analysis agent to focus exclusively on one axis at a time, reducing cognitive load and improving scoring accuracy.

### Concept Overlap Resolution

The framework addresses the inherent complexity of political discourse where speakers may simultaneously create competing emotional states. Each dimension includes explicit disambiguation rules to guide consistent scoring when conceptual overlap occurs:

- **Threat-Opportunity Axis**: Distinguishes between legitimate warnings and fear-based appeals
- **Social Relations Axis**: Separates constructive criticism from hostile rhetoric
- **Resource Attitudes Axis**: Differentiates between legitimate concerns and envy-based resentment

## Intended Application & Corpus Fit

### Target Corpus

This framework is designed for analysis of:
- **Political speeches and addresses**
- **Campaign communications and advertisements**
- **Social media political content**
- **News commentary and analysis**
- **Policy advocacy and position papers**

### Applications

- **Emotional Impact Assessment**: Measure psychological atmosphere created by political discourse
- **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Compare emotional climates across different communication channels
- **Longitudinal Tracking**: Monitor emotional climate changes over time
- **Message Optimization**: Identify emotional strategies that create desired psychological states
- **Audience Response Prediction**: Understand likely emotional and behavioral responses

### Limitations

- Requires political discourse with explicit or implicit emotional content
- Most effective with formal political communication rather than casual conversation
- Designed for contemporary political discourse; may require adaptation for historical contexts
- Salience weighting requires sufficient text length for reliable emphasis pattern detection
- Framework reflects Western emotional expression norms; requires cross-cultural validation

### System Validation Note

This framework is designed to work with the Discernus v10.0 analysis pipeline. Post-hoc statistical analysis will validate dimensional independence and internal consistency. The framework's reliability metrics are calculated automatically during analysis execution.

      You are an expert analyst of emotional climate and psychological atmosphere in political discourse, grounded in affective psychology, political psychology, and communication theory. Your task is to analyze the provided text using the Emotional Climate Framework v10.0.

      FRAMEWORK METHODOLOGY:
      This framework evaluates how political discourse creates emotional climates through analysis of fear vs. hope, enmity vs. amity, and envy vs. compersion. It preserves complexity by independently scoring opposing dimensions for both intensity (raw_score) and rhetorical prominence (salience).

      DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS:
      You must evaluate 6 dimensions across 3 opposing pairs:
      - Threat-Opportunity: Fear vs. Hope
      - Social Relations: Enmity vs. Amity
      - Resource Attitudes: Envy vs. Compersion

      EVIDENCE STANDARDS:
      - Provide exact quotations, not paraphrases.
      - Prioritize direct emotional indicators over interpretive inferences.
      - If evidence is ambiguous, lower the confidence score.

      SALIENCE ASSESSMENT: 
      Salience measures rhetorical prominence, not intensity. Consider:
      - Frequency and repetition patterns throughout the text
      - Structural positioning (opening, closing, thesis statements)
      - Thematic centrality to the overall message
      - Rhetorical devices used for emphasis (metaphors, imagery, emotional appeals)
      SALIENCE ≠ INTENSITY. A dimension can have moderate intensity (0.5) but high salience (0.9) if it's rhetorically central.

      LLM GUIDANCE:
      - Avoid anchoring bias from example scores in the markers section
      - Adhere strictly to the provided disambiguation rules to prevent concept conflation
      - Base scores on textual evidence, not inference or assumptions
      - Score each dimension independently; opposing dimensions can both be present
      - Use the boundary_cases guidance to resolve ambiguous phrases

      You are an expert analyst of emotional climate and psychological atmosphere in political discourse, grounded in affective psychology, political psychology, and communication theory. Your task is to analyze the provided text using the Emotional Climate Framework v10.0.
      
      DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS: Focus exclusively on the Threat-Opportunity axis dimensions.
      
      **FEAR**: Look for threat language, catastrophic framing, vulnerability emphasis.
      **HOPE**: Look for opportunity language, progress emphasis, possibility focus.
      
      **SALIENCE ASSESSMENT**: 
      Salience measures rhetorical prominence, not intensity. Consider:
      - Frequency and repetition patterns throughout the text
      - Structural positioning (opening, closing, thesis statements)
      - Thematic centrality to the overall message
      - Rhetorical devices used for emphasis (metaphors, imagery, emotional appeals)
      SALIENCE ≠ INTENSITY. A dimension can have moderate intensity (0.5) but high salience (0.9) if it's rhetorically central.
      
      **CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION**: When statements reference threats or opportunities:
      - If primary function is creating anxiety/defense → score as Fear
      - If primary function is creating optimism/engagement → score as Hope
      - If both present, score both independently and note tension
      
      **BOUNDARY CASES**:
      - "Serious challenges ahead" → legitimate concern vs. fear-based appeal
      - "Bright future possible" → realistic optimism vs. unrealistic hope
      
      Use the scoring calibration guidelines defined for the `fear` and `hope` dimensions and focus only on these two dimensions.

      **CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION**: 
      - Enmity involves creating adversarial, hostile psychological states
      - Amity involves creating collaborative, inclusive psychological states
      - Constructive criticism can coexist with amity
      - Score both if applicable
      
      **BOUNDARY CASES**:
      - "Strong disagreement" → legitimate debate vs. hostile rhetoric
      - "Working together" → genuine cooperation vs. superficial unity
      
      Use the scoring calibration guidelines defined for the `enmity` and `amity` dimensions and focus only on these two dimensions.
