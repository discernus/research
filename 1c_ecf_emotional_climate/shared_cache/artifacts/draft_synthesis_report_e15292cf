## 1. Executive Summary

This computational analysis of eight significant political speeches from 1963-2025 reveals distinct, recurring emotional archetypes in American political discourse. Using the Emotional Climate Factorial (ECF v10.0) framework, which measures six dimensions of emotion across three oppositional axes (Fear/Hope, Enmity/Amity, Envy/Compersion), this preliminary study identifies three primary "emotional climates." The most prevalent is a **High-Intensity, Contested Climate**, characterized by a volatile mix of high levels of both negative (fear, enmity) and positive (hope, amity) emotions. This suggests that much of the analyzed discourse is not simply positive or negative, but emotionally complex and conflict-oriented. Two other archetypes were identified: a purely **Unifying & Optimistic Climate**, defined by high hope and amity with a near-absence of negativity, and a **Fear-Driven Antagonistic Climate**, which relies heavily on fear and enmity while suppressing positive emotions.

The analysis uncovered strong, structurally significant correlations that function as underlying "rules" of rhetorical strategy. A very strong positive correlation in the rhetorical emphasis (salience) on Hope and Amity (*r* = .84) indicates these themes are strategically bundled to project a vision of unity. Conversely, the analysis revealed a powerful rhetorical trade-off, evidenced by a near-perfect negative correlation between the salience of Enmity and Compersion (*r* = -.91). This suggests speakers make a stark choice between attacking an out-group (Enmity) and celebrating in-group success or shared values (Compersion); they cannot effectively emphasize both simultaneously.

While the small sample size (N=8) means these findings should be considered indicative rather than definitive, the ECF framework demonstrated strong discriminatory power. The primary derived metric, the Emotional Climate Index (ECI), effectively differentiated the texts, ranging from a highly positive 0.76 (John McCain, 2008) to a deeply negative -0.63 (Steve King, 2017). These preliminary results provide a robust, data-driven foundation for generating new hypotheses about the structure and evolution of emotional expression in political communication.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Political Discourse Organizes into Three Emotional Archetypes:** The corpus clustered into three distinct emotional profiles:
    *   **Unifying & Optimistic (Cluster 2):** Low negativity, high positivity (Hope, Amity, Compersion). (e.g., John McCain's 2008 concession speech, ECI = 0.76).
    *   **Fear-Driven Antagonistic (Cluster 0):** High fear and enmity, low positivity. (e.g., Steve King's 2017 speech, ECI = -0.63).
    *   **High-Intensity Contested (Cluster 1):** The most common archetype, featuring high levels of both positive and negative emotions simultaneously, indicating a complex and conflictual emotional landscape. (e.g., Cory Booker's 2018 speech, Climate Intensity = 0.74).

*   **Rhetoric of Hope is Bound to Rhetoric of Unity:** The analysis revealed a very strong positive correlation between the salience of Hope and Amity (*r* = .84). This indicates that when speakers choose to rhetorically emphasize an optimistic future, they almost invariably pair it with messages of togetherness and collaboration.

*   **Attacking Opponents and Celebrating Allies are Mutually Exclusive Strategies:** The strongest statistical pattern was a near-perfect negative correlation between the salience of Enmity and Compersion (*r* = -.91). This highlights a fundamental rhetorical trade-off: prioritizing attacks on an enemy precludes the celebration of allies' merits, and vice-versa.

*   **Fear and Enmity are a Common Rhetorical Pairing:** A strong positive correlation between the raw intensity of Fear and Enmity (*r* = .72) suggests a frequently used "threat-and-enemy" narrative. Speakers often evoke a sense of danger and simultaneously identify an antagonist responsible for that danger.

*   **The Overall Emotional Climate of the Corpus is Negative:** Across the eight documents, the average Emotional Climate Index (ECI) was negative (*M* = -0.15), driven by a higher mean score for negative emotions (*M* = 0.61) compared to positive emotions (*M* = 0.46). This suggests that, within this sample, political discourse leans more heavily on themes of fear, enmity, and envy than on hope, amity, and compersion.

## 4. Methodology

This study employed the Emotional Climate Factorial (ECF v10.0) framework to conduct a computational analysis of a corpus of eight significant American political speeches. The analysis was performed according to a strict, sequential protocol to ensure rigor and reproducibility.

**Framework Description:** The ECF framework is a multi-dimensional analytical tool designed to measure the emotional content of a text. It operates on six primary dimensions organized into three oppositional axes:
1.  **Threat-Opportunity Axis:** Measures the balance between **Fear** (perception of danger, risk, or threat) and **Hope** (optimism, aspiration, and vision for a positive future).
2.  **Social Relations Axis:** Measures the balance between **Enmity** (antagonism, hostility, or identification of an enemy) and **Amity** (friendship, collaboration, and appeals to unity).
3.  **Resource Attitudes Axis:** Measures the balance between **Envy** (focus on scarcity, resentment of others' resources) and **Compersion** (celebration of others' success, merit, or shared prosperity).

For each dimension, the framework provides a `raw` score (intensity of the emotion, 0-1) and a `salience` score (rhetorical emphasis, 0-1). From these, several derived metrics are calculated, most notably the **Emotional Climate Index (ECI)**, a single composite score representing the overall emotional valence of a text, and **Climate Intensity**, representing the total volume of emotional language. A positive ECI indicates a climate dominated by hope, amity, and compersion, while a negative ECI reflects a climate of fear, enmity, and envy.

**Data and Corpus:** The corpus consists of 8 text documents of political speeches spanning from 1963 to a hypothetical 2025. The speakers represent a range of political ideologies and historical contexts.

**Statistical Methods:** The analysis involved several statistical procedures. Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) were calculated for all raw, salience, and derived metrics. Pearson correlation analysis was used to identify relationships between the emotional dimensions. Finally, K-Means clustering was employed to identify naturally occurring groups of documents with similar emotional profiles, or "archetypes."

**Limitations:** The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=8). Consequently, the findings should be interpreted as preliminary and suggestive, providing a foundation for future hypothesis testing rather than definitive conclusions. The analysis is descriptive and correlational; no causal claims can be made. The lack of metadata for speaker party and ideology prevented a planned two-way ANOVA, limiting the ability to draw conclusions about group differences.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An overview of the emotional dimensions across the corpus reveals a tendency towards negative emotional expression. The mean Negative Emotional Index (*M* = 0.61, *SD* = 0.29) was higher than the mean Positive Emotional Index (*M* = 0.46, *SD* = 0.25). This resulted in an average Emotional Climate Index (ECI) that was negative (*M* = -0.15, *SD* = 0.43), indicating that the discourse in this sample is, on average, more focused on threat and conflict than on opportunity and unity. The average Climate Intensity was moderate (*M* = 0.53, *SD* = 0.16), though certain speeches, like Cory Booker's, registered significantly higher intensity (*Climate Intensity* = 0.74).

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key ECF Metrics (N=8)**
| Metric                      | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min.   | Max.   |
| --------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Raw Scores**              |       |           |        |        |
| Fear Raw                    | 0.71  | 0.22      | 0.20   | 0.90   |
| Hope Raw                    | 0.56  | 0.17      | 0.30   | 0.85   |
| Enmity Raw                  | 0.61  | 0.36      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| Amity Raw                   | 0.60  | 0.30      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| Envy Raw                    | 0.50  | 0.42      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| Compersion Raw              | 0.21  | 0.37      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| **Derived Indices**         |       |           |        |        |
| Emotional Climate Index     | -0.15 | 0.43      | -0.63  | 0.76   |
| Climate Intensity           | 0.53  | 0.16      | 0.30   | 0.74   |
| Positive Emotional Index    | 0.46  | 0.25      | 0.10   | 0.83   |
| Negative Emotional Index    | 0.61  | 0.29      | 0.07   | 0.90   |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Identifying the Extremes

The derived metrics effectively captured the vast differences in emotional tone across the corpus. John McCain's 2008 concession speech stands as a significant outlier with the highest ECI score (0.76), driven by high Hope, Amity, and Compersion and exceptionally low Fear and Enmity. This speech serves as the archetype of a positive, unifying emotional climate. As McCain stated, "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

At the opposite extreme, Steve King's 2017 House floor speech registered the lowest ECI score (-0.63), making it the most negative document in the corpus. This score was the result of high Fear and Enmity combined with a complete absence of Amity, Envy, and Compersion. The speech's narrative focused intensely on threat, as seen in the line: "This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). These two speeches anchor the emotional spectrum of the corpus and demonstrate the ECI's discriminatory power.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis: The Rules of Emotional Rhetoric

The correlation analysis reveals the underlying structural relationships between the emotional dimensions, suggesting consistent rhetorical strategies. The patterns were strong for raw scores and even more pronounced for salience scores, indicating deliberate strategic choices by the speakers.

**Table 2: Key Correlations for Raw and Salience Scores**
| Correlated Pair                 | Raw Score (*r*) | Salience Score (*r*) | Interpretation                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Hope and Amity                  | .77             | .84                  | Strong positive link; unifying optimism      |
| Fear and Enmity                 | .72             | .73                  | Strong positive link; threat-and-enemy       |
| Enmity and Compersion           | -.73            | -.91                 | Very strong negative link; attack vs. build  |
| Hope and Compersion             | .77             | .75                  | Strong positive link; celebrating success    |

The data reveals two dominant positive pairings. First, **Hope and Amity are strongly linked** (raw *r* = .77, salience *r* = .84). This suggests that appeals to a better future are rhetorically packaged with calls for unity. John McCain's speech exemplifies this, linking "the promise and greatness of America" with the need to "bridge our differences" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). Similarly, Cory Booker connects shared values to overcoming division: "We share those common values because we still live in a a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us" (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt).

Second, **Fear and Enmity are a potent combination** (raw *r* = .72). Speakers frequently evoke danger while simultaneously naming an antagonist. This pattern appears in John Lewis's 1963 speech, where he warns of "the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond" that "will not stop this revolution!" (Source: john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington.txt), directly linking a threat to specific political enemies.

The most striking finding is the **powerful inverse relationship between Enmity and Compersion**, especially in their salience scores (*r* = -.91). This near-perfect negative correlation suggests a fundamental rhetorical choice: a speaker can either focus on attacking an out-group or on celebrating the virtues of an in-group, but not both. Speeches high in Enmity, such as those by Bernie Sanders and AOC, focus on a malevolent oligarchy: "They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). These speeches have zero Compersion. Conversely, John McCain's speech, which is high in Compersion, celebrates his opponent's achievement: "...that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans...is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). This speech has zero Enmity. This stark trade-off represents a core strategic fork in political communication.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition: Three Emotional Archetypes

K-Means clustering sorted the eight documents into three distinct groups, revealing clear emotional archetypes.

**Cluster 0: Fear-Driven Antagonism**
This cluster, comprising Mitt Romney's and Steve King's speeches, is defined by high Fear (*M* = 0.80) and moderate Enmity (*M* = 0.50), with a near-total absence of Hope, Amity, and Compersion. The emotional climate is bleak, focusing on threats and denunciation. Mitt Romney's speech on impeachment captures this tone: "I’m aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced" (Source: mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt). This archetype represents a rhetoric of principled but isolated opposition against a perceived hostile force.

**Cluster 1: High-Intensity, Contested Climate**
This is the largest cluster, containing five documents from across the political spectrum (Lewis, Booker, Sanders, AOC, Vance). Its defining feature is high intensity across *both* negative and positive dimensions: high Fear (*M* = 0.78), Enmity (*M* = 0.77), and Envy (*M* = 0.80) coexisting with high Hope (*M* = 0.61) and Amity (*M* = 0.68). This indicates a complex, emotionally charged style of discourse where speakers are simultaneously fighting against a threat and fighting for a vision. Cory Booker's speech embodies this, decrying a system that is a "cancer on the soul of our country" while also celebrating a "bipartisan coalition" (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt). This archetype suggests that much of modern political speech is a battle fought on multiple, conflicting emotional fronts.

**Cluster 2: Unifying & Optimistic**
This small cluster contains only John McCain's 2008 concession speech. It is the polar opposite of Cluster 0, characterized by very high Hope (*M* = 0.70), Amity (*M* = 0.90), and Compersion (*M* = 0.90), with minimal Fear and zero Enmity. This archetype represents a rhetoric of grace, unity, and optimism. Its core message is to "not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). Its rarity in this corpus makes it particularly noteworthy.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The ECF v10.0 framework proved highly effective for this analysis. Its oppositional structure was validated by the strong negative correlations observed between opposing dimensions, most notably Enmity and Compersion (*r* = -.73) and Fear and Compersion (*r* = -.70). This confirms that the framework's constructs are behaving as theoretically expected. The framework demonstrated excellent discriminatory power, clearly separating the documents into meaningful clusters and producing a wide, interpretable range of ECI scores. The distinction between `raw` and `salience` scores was particularly insightful, revealing the difference between the mere presence of an emotion and its deliberate rhetorical emphasis, as seen in the intensified correlations for salience scores.

## 6. Discussion

The preliminary findings of this analysis suggest that American political discourse, at least within this small sample, is not a simple monolith but rather a collection of distinct emotional strategies. The identification of three emotional archetypes—**Unifying & Optimistic**, **Fear-Driven Antagonistic**, and **High-Intensity Contested**—provides a new lens for understanding political communication.

The prevalence of the "High-Intensity, Contested" climate is perhaps the most significant finding. It suggests that many political actors operate in a complex emotional space, simultaneously stoking fear of an opponent while inspiring hope in their own vision. This duality may reflect the polarized nature of contemporary politics, where mobilizing a base requires both a powerful enemy to fight against and a compelling future to fight for. This finding warrants further investigation with a larger, diachronic corpus to determine if this emotionally fraught style is a recent development or a long-standing feature of political rhetoric.

The discovery of the Enmity/Compersion trade-off (*r* = -.91) has profound implications. It suggests a fundamental cleavage in rhetorical strategy between deconstructive (attack-oriented) and constructive (celebration-oriented) messaging. A speaker's position on this spectrum may be a powerful indicator of their overall political strategy: are they seeking to win by tearing down an opponent or by building up their own coalition? This single metric could serve as a powerful new variable for political science research.

While these findings are compelling, the study's limitations must be underscored. With a sample size of only eight documents, these archetypes and correlations are indicative, not definitive. They serve as data-driven hypotheses for future research. A larger study could test whether these archetypes hold across different contexts (e.g., campaign speeches vs. legislative debates) and track their prevalence over time. Such research could explore whether certain political parties or ideologies gravitate towards specific emotional archetypes and how these patterns have shifted across different political eras.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though preliminary, successfully demonstrates the utility of the Emotional Climate Factorial framework in uncovering the deep structural patterns of political emotion. The study moved beyond simple sentiment analysis to reveal a nuanced landscape of competing emotional strategies. Its key contributions are the identification of three distinct emotional archetypes and the discovery of a powerful rhetorical trade-off between attacking opponents and celebrating allies.

The framework's oppositional design was validated by the data, and its derived metrics proved capable of meaningfully distinguishing between texts. By integrating statistical analysis with qualitative evidence, this report provides a rich, multi-layered interpretation of the emotional dynamics at play in a small but significant sample of American political speech. The patterns uncovered here offer a fertile ground for future research, providing testable hypotheses about the nature of political persuasion and the evolution of public discourse.
