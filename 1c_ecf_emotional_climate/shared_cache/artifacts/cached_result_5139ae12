      "description": "The experiment specifies a 2x3 factorial design for a two-way ANOVA, but the corpus is critically unbalanced and underpowered. The design contains an empty cell (Civil Rights / Conservative, n=0) and two cells with only one observation (Civil Rights / Progressive, n=1; Institutional / Progressive, n=1). A two-way ANOVA cannot be performed without at least one observation in every cell, and interactions cannot be calculated on cells with n=1. The experiment's description of the corpus as a \"balanced\" design is factually incorrect.",
      "impact": "The primary statistical analysis (two-way ANOVA) specified in the research questions and methodology is impossible to execute. The experiment will fail as it cannot answer its core research questions about interaction effects.",
      "fix": "To perform a two-way ANOVA, the corpus must be redesigned to be fully populated. At a minimum, add at least one document to the 'Civil Rights / Conservative' cell and one document to the 'Institutional / Progressive' cell. To meet statistical power guidelines for inferential testing, each of the six cells should contain at least 2-3 documents.",

      "description": "The experiment proposes hypothesis testing (two-way ANOVA) with a total sample size of N=8. According to the Experiment v10.0 specification, a sample size of N=4-9 is only sufficient for 'Case study analysis, qualitative patterns, individual document insights' and is explicitly insufficient for hypothesis testing, which requires a minimum of N=10.",
      "impact": "The proposed statistical analysis violates the platform's minimum sample size requirements for hypothesis testing. Executing an ANOVA on this data would yield statistically meaningless results and is disallowed.",
      "fix": "Either significantly expand the corpus to meet the minimum sample size for the desired statistical tests (N>10, with balanced cells for ANOVA) or revise the 'Research Questions' and 'Methodology' to focus on qualitative or descriptive analysis appropriate for a small-N case study.",

      "description": "The experiment's abstract defines the 'Populist Era' as '2022-2025,' but the corpus selection in the same document includes speeches from 2017 (Steve King) and 2022 (JD Vance). This contradicts the stated temporal boundary. The corpus manifest correctly lists a broader range, creating an inconsistency between the experiment's prose and its specified components.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency confuses the research design's temporal scope for human reviewers, although machine execution would likely proceed based on the corpus manifest's metadata. It undermines the clarity and precision of the research plan.",
      "fix": "In the experiment specification's abstract and methodology sections, update the definition of the 'Populist Era' to accurately reflect the years of the documents included in the corpus (e.g., 'Populist Era (2017-2025)').",
