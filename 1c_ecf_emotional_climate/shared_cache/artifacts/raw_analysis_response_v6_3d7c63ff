    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the speaker's populist framing, which establishes a strong in-group ('the American people', 'national conservatives') and multiple out-groups ('elites', 'the Wall Street Journal editorial page', 'the left'). This rhetorical strategy makes the Enmity, Envy, and Fear dimensions particularly intense and salient. Hope and Amity are primarily expressed in the context of the in-group's perceived progress and future success. Compersion is nearly absent, appearing only briefly in a personal anecdote."
