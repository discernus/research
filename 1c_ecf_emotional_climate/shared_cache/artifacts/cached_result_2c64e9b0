      "description": "The 2x3 factorial corpus design is critically unbalanced and incomplete. It contains an empty cell (Conservative / Civil Rights: n=0) and multiple cells with only one document (e.g., Civil Rights / Progressive: n=1). This makes the primary proposed statistical test, a two-way ANOVA, impossible to execute as it violates the minimum sample size requirements per group (n\u22652) for inferential testing.",
      "impact": "The experiment will fail during statistical analysis. The system cannot perform a two-way ANOVA on a dataset with empty cells or groups with n=1. The central research questions about interaction effects between ideology and era cannot be answered.",
      "fix": "To enable a 2x3 ANOVA, the corpus must be redesigned to be fully balanced. Ensure each of the 6 cells in the Ideology \u00d7 Era matrix contains at least 2 documents. This requires adding documents to the 'Civil Rights / Conservative' cell (currently n=0) and the 'Civil Rights / Progressive' and 'Institutional / Progressive' cells (currently n=1).",

      "description": "The description of the corpus as 'balanced' in both the experiment and corpus specifications is factually incorrect. The cell counts are 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, which is not a balanced design for a 2x3 factorial analysis.",
      "impact": "The experiment's description is misleading and misrepresents the statistical viability of the research design. This undermines the credibility of the setup.",
      "fix": "Remove the term 'balanced' when describing the corpus in both the experiment and corpus files, or redesign the corpus to be truly balanced as per the other blocking issue.",

      "impact": "This inconsistency creates ambiguity regarding the temporal boundaries of a key experimental factor, which could affect interpretation and replication.",
      "fix": "Standardize the definition of the 'Populist Era' across all documents. It is recommended to update the experiment specification prose to match the corpus manifest's range of '2017-2025'.",
