    "analysis_notes": "The analysis of this speech reveals a dominant and highly salient emotional climate of Fear and Enmity. The speaker's rhetoric centers on two primary threats: judicial activism undermining the Constitution and, more prominently, violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The latter argument is supported by graphic, emotional anecdotes. Envy/Grievance is a significant secondary theme, framing the system as unfairly protecting criminals over citizens. Amity is present but limited to an in-group, while Hope and Compersion are almost entirely absent, resulting in a deeply negative and conflict-oriented emotional atmosphere."
