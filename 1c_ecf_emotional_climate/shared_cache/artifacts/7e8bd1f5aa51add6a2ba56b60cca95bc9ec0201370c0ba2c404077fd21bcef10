    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with a very strong and clear rhetorical structure. The primary emotional drivers are Envy (grievance against a wealthy elite) and Enmity (defining this elite as a hostile opponent). Amity (a call for solidarity among the working class) is presented as the primary strategic response. Fear is present as a consequence of the elite's actions, while Hope is a minor theme tied to the potential success of the proposed solidarity. Compersion is entirely absent."
