    "analysis_notes": "The document is a highly emotional political speech, making the dimensions of the Emotional Climate Framework clearly identifiable. The speaker uses vivid imagery and direct address to evoke strong feelings of fear, enmity, and grievance, while simultaneously fostering hope and amity within the movement. The dimensions of Envy and Compersion are less central but still detectable. The analysis focuses on the explicit language used to create a specific psychological atmosphere for the audience."
