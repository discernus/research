The primary emotional climate is one of threat and crisis, centered on the perceived danger to constitutional principles. This is counterbalanced by a deliberate, though secondary, appeal to amity among Senate colleagues. The language of enmity is expressed through severe judgment of actions rather than personal hostility."
