    "analysis_notes": "The document exhibits an extremely strong and salient emotional climate, predominantly characterized by Fear and Enmity. The speaker employs graphic, narrative examples of violence to evoke Fear and directly accuses the President and the Judiciary to create Enmity. The positive dimensions of Hope, Amity, and Compersion are entirely absent. Envy is present at a very low level, targeting the perceived unaccountable power of the judiciary."
