The speech is characterized by a solemn tone, where a strong sense of threat to constitutional principles (Fear) is the dominant theme and justification for the speaker's actions. This is paired with a direct condemnation of the President's actions (Enmity). However, the speaker attempts to mitigate the partisan conflict by framing his decision within a context of duty and by extending respect to his colleagues (Amity). Hope, Envy, and Compersion are largely absent or play very minor rhetorical roles.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.2,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"enmity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"amity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.5,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"envy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"compersion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"fear\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"justification_of_decision\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"fear\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"What he did was not perfect.
