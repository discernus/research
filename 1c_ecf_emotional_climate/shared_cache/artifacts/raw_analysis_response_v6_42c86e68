    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with a strong populist framing. It establishes a clear conflict between an in-group ('working people') and an out-group ('oligarchs', 'billionaires'), leading to high scores on negative dimensions like Fear, Enmity, and Envy directed at the out-group. Conversely, it scores highly on Amity by calling for solidarity within the in-group. Hope is presented as a contingent outcome of this struggle, while Compersion is entirely absent."
