    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the explicit emotional framing used by the speaker. The speech is characterized by a solemn tone, where a strong sense of threat to constitutional principles (Fear) is the dominant theme and justification for the speaker's actions. This is paired with a direct condemnation of the President's actions (Enmity). However, the speaker attempts to mitigate the partisan conflict by framing his decision within a context of duty and by extending respect to his colleagues (Amity). Hope, Envy, and Compersion are largely absent or play very minor rhetorical roles."
