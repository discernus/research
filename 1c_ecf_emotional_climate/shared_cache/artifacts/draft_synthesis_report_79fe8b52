## 1. Executive Summary

This computational social science analysis examines the emotional climate of a diverse corpus of eight significant political speeches spanning from 1963 to 2025. Using the novel Emotional Climate Framework (ECF v10), this report identifies and quantifies the underlying emotional strategies in political discourse. The framework measures six primary emotions organized into three oppositional axes: Threat/Opportunity (Fear vs. Hope), Social Relations (Enmity vs. Amity), and Resource Attitudes (Envy vs. Compersion). By combining raw emotional intensity with rhetorical salience, the framework generates a nuanced Emotional Climate Index (ECI) and other derived metrics.

The analysis reveals a dominant emotional archetype in political communication, which we term the **'Mixed Negative with High Envy'** climate. Characterizing five of the eight documents, this signature combines high levels of fear, enmity, and grievance-based envy with appeals to in-group hope and solidarity. This complex emotional cocktail appears to be a pervasive and historically enduring strategy, present in speeches from the Civil Rights era to contemporary populist rhetoric. The data shows this mixed-motive style has largely supplanted purely positive/conciliatory or purely antagonistic approaches.

A key finding is the structural opposition between hostility and shared celebration. The analysis uncovered an extremely strong negative correlation between the rhetorical emphasis on Enmity and Compersion (celebrating others' success) (r = -0.91), suggesting a fundamental trade-off in political communication. The overall corpus reflects this, with a negative average Emotional Climate Index (M = -0.15) and exceptionally low scores for Compersion. These preliminary findings, based on a small but diverse sample, indicate that the ECF framework is highly effective at uncovering sophisticated emotional strategies and that modern political discourse may be structurally oriented around grievance and conflict over shared progress.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **A 'Mixed Negative' Emotional Signature Dominates Political Discourse:** The most prevalent emotional pattern, found in 5 of 8 documents, is not purely negative but a complex blend of high fear, enmity, and envy, coupled with targeted hope and amity. This suggests a sophisticated "populist" strategy of mobilizing a base through shared grievance and threat while offering in-group solidarity.
*   **The Rhetoric of Enmity Precludes Shared Celebration:** The analysis revealed a near-perfect inverse relationship between the salience of Enmity and Compersion (r = -0.91). When speakers choose to rhetorically emphasize an enemy, they almost completely abandon the language of celebrating others' success, indicating a powerful and limiting strategic trade-off.
*   **Compersion is a Negligible Force in Political Speech:** Across the corpus, Compersion (joy in others' fortune) was the least present and least emphasized emotion (M_raw = 0.21). This emotional deficit, combined with a generally negative Resource Attitudes Balance (M = -0.30), points to a political environment where grievance and envy are far more common tools than celebrating mutual or national success.
*   **Grievance is Strategically Paired with Hope:** Counter-intuitively, the analysis found a moderate positive correlation between Envy and Hope (r = 0.44). This suggests that expressions of grievance are not merely complaints but are often strategically deployed to inspire hope for a rectified future for a specific in-group, a hallmark of the dominant 'Mixed Negative' cluster.
*   **Distinct Emotional Archetypes Exist but are Rare:** The analysis identified three clear emotional clusters. While the 'Mixed Negative' cluster was dominant, two other archetypes provide contrast: a purely **'Negative/Antagonistic'** climate (high fear/enmity, no positive emotions) and a purely **'Positive/Collaborative'** climate (high hope/amity/compersion). The rarity of these pure forms highlights the prevalence of the more complex, mixed-motive strategy.
*   **The ECF Framework Demonstrates Strong Construct Validity:** The consistent negative correlations between the framework's opposing dimensions (e.g., Fear vs. Hope, Enmity vs. Amity) validate its theoretical design. The framework successfully discriminates between different emotional strategies and provides a nuanced, multi-layered view of political communication.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the **Emotional Climate Framework (ECF v10)**, a computational model designed to analyze the emotional tenor of texts. The framework's structure was inferred from the project's statistical analysis functions. It operates on six primary emotional dimensions grouped into three oppositional axes:

1.  **Threat/Opportunity Axis:** Measures the balance between **Fear** (perception of danger, risk, or threat) and **Hope** (expression of optimism and positive future outcomes).
2.  **Social Relations Axis:** Measures the balance between **Enmity** (hostility towards an out-group, identification of enemies) and **Amity** (appeals to friendship, unity, and in-group solidarity).
3.  **Resource Attitudes Axis:** Measures the balance between **Envy** (grievance over perceived unfair distribution of resources or status) and **Compersion** (joy or celebration of others' success and fortune).

For each dimension, the analysis captures both a **raw score** (intensity of the emotion) and a **salience score** (rhetorical prominence). These are used to calculate derived metrics, most notably the **Emotional Climate Index (ECI)**, a single, salience-weighted score representing the overall emotional balance of a document. Positive ECI values indicate a hopeful, collaborative climate, while negative values indicate a fearful, antagonistic one. Other metrics include Climate Intensity (overall emotionality) and axis-level balance scores.

### Data and Corpus

The analysis was performed on the **Emotional Climate Factorial Analysis Corpus**, a set of 8 documents containing transcripts of significant American political speeches. The corpus spans a wide historical range (1963-2025) and includes speakers from various political contexts, such as John Lewis, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, and Steve King.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations

The analysis followed a multi-step quantitative process.
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Means, standard deviations, and ranges were calculated for all raw scores, salience scores, and derived metrics to establish baseline emotional characteristics of the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** Pearson correlation matrices were computed for both raw and salience scores to identify relationships between emotional dimensions and validate the framework's oppositional structure.
3.  **Cluster Analysis:** K-Means clustering (k=3) was performed on the six raw emotional scores to identify recurring emotional archetypes or "signatures" across the documents.

A significant limitation of this study is the small sample size (N=8). Consequently, all findings should be considered preliminary and indicative rather than generalizable. The analysis is descriptive and exploratory. Inferential statistical tests like ANOVA, though planned, could not be executed because the necessary metadata (e.g., speaker ideology, political era) was unavailable for grouping, as noted by the error in the `perform_two_way_anova` function. All claims are therefore based on the patterns observed within this specific corpus.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An overview of the corpus reveals a political discourse that is, on average, more negative than positive. The mean Emotional Climate Index (ECI) for the corpus is -0.15, with a wide range from a highly positive 0.76 (`john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`) to a highly negative -0.63 (`steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).

The mean scores for negative emotions (Fear: M = 0.71, Enmity: M = 0.61, Envy: M = 0.50) are consistently higher than their positive counterparts, with one exception (Amity: M = 0.60 vs. Enmity: M = 0.61). Most notably, **Compersion** is the least prevalent emotion by a significant margin, with a mean raw score of just 0.21. This indicates that celebrating the success of others is a rare event in this sample of political speech.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for ECF Dimensions and Metrics (N=8)**
| Metric                        | Mean   | SD     | Min     | Max    |
|-------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Raw Scores**                |        |        |         |        |
| Fear                          | 0.71   | 0.22   | 0.20    | 0.90   |
| Hope                          | 0.56   | 0.17   | 0.30    | 0.85   |
| Enmity                        | 0.61   | 0.36   | 0.00    | 0.90   |
| Amity                         | 0.60   | 0.30   | 0.00    | 0.90   |
| Envy                          | 0.50   | 0.42   | 0.00    | 0.90   |
| Compersion                    | 0.21   | 0.37   | 0.00    | 0.90   |
| **Derived Indices**           |        |        |         |        |
| Emotional Climate Index (ECI) | -0.15  | 0.43   | -0.63   | 0.76   |
| Climate Intensity             | 0.53   | 0.16   | 0.30    | 0.74   |
| Positive Emotional Index      | 0.46   | 0.25   | 0.10    | 0.83   |
| Negative Emotional Index      | 0.61   | 0.29   | 0.07    | 0.90   |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics reveal deeper structural patterns. The **Negative Emotional Index** (M = 0.61) is substantially higher than the **Positive Emotional Index** (M = 0.46), confirming the overall negative tilt of the corpus. The axis-level balances further specify this negativity. The **Resource Attitudes Balance** is the most negative on average (M = -0.30), driven by the combination of high Envy and low Compersion. This suggests that discourse around resources is primarily framed as a zero-sum conflict or grievance. The **Threat/Opportunity Balance** is also negative (M = -0.13), while the **Social Relations Balance** is near neutral (M = -0.01).

The two documents with the most extreme ECI scores serve as useful archetypes. John McCain's 2008 concession speech has the highest ECI (0.76), driven by high scores in Hope, Amity, and Compersion. He actively seeks to build bridges, stating, "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together" (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`). In stark contrast, Steve King's 2017 floor speech has the lowest ECI (-0.63), characterized by high Fear and Enmity with a complete absence of Amity, Envy, and Compersion. His focus is on threat, lamenting that a particular policy is "costing, it's costing in the end thousands of lives in America" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

Correlation analysis provides strong validation for the ECF framework's design and uncovers key strategic pairings of emotions. As expected, dimensions within the same valence are positively correlated, while dimensions on opposing ends of an axis are negatively correlated.

**Table 2: Correlation Matrix for Raw Emotional Scores**
|             | Fear   | Hope   | Enmity | Amity  | Envy   | Compersion |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| **Fear**    | 1.00   | -0.41  | **0.72** | -0.41  | 0.41   | **-0.70**  |
| **Hope**    | -0.41  | 1.00   | -0.32  | **0.77** | 0.44   | **0.77**   |
| **Enmity**  | **0.72** | -0.32  | 1.00   | -0.40  | 0.64   | **-0.73**  |
| **Amity**   | -0.41  | **0.77** | -0.40  | 1.00   | 0.35   | 0.61       |
| **Envy**    | 0.41   | 0.44   | 0.64   | 0.35   | 1.00   | -0.19      |
| **Compersion**| **-0.70**| **0.77** | **-0.73**| 0.61   | -0.19  | 1.00       |
*Note: Strongest correlations (>|0.70|) are bolded.*

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix for Salience Scores**
|             | Fear   | Hope   | Enmity | Amity  | Envy   | Compersion |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| **Fear**    | 1.00   | -0.32  | **0.73** | -0.32  | 0.23   | **-0.73**  |
| **Hope**    | -0.32  | 1.00   | -0.53  | **0.84** | 0.27   | **0.75**   |
| **Enmity**  | **0.73** | -0.53  | 1.00   | -0.31  | 0.56   | **-0.91**  |
| **Amity**   | -0.32  | **0.84** | -0.31  | 1.00   | 0.48   | 0.49       |
| **Envy**    | 0.23   | 0.27   | 0.56   | 0.48   | 1.00   | -0.22      |
| **Compersion**| **-0.73**| **0.75** | **-0.91**| 0.49   | -0.22  | 1.00       |
*Note: Strongest correlations (>|0.70|) are bolded.*

Key findings from the correlation analysis include:
*   **Validation of Positive/Negative Groupings:** There are strong positive correlations between Fear and Enmity (r_raw = 0.72) and between Hope and Amity (r_raw = 0.77, r_salience = 0.84). This confirms that these emotions are often deployed together.
*   **The Enmity-Compersion Trade-off:** The most striking finding is the extremely strong negative correlation between Enmity salience and Compersion salience (r = -0.91). This indicates that as speakers rhetorically emphasize an enemy, they systematically avoid celebrating the successes of others. This is evident in texts high in enmity, such as Steve King's, which contains zero compersion and focuses on external threats: "But the Supreme Court, wrapped in the cloak of Marbury versus Madison... decides that they can write words into the law" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).
*   **The Strategic Pairing of Envy and Hope:** A counter-intuitive but important pattern is the moderate positive correlation between Envy and Hope (r_raw = 0.44) and between Envy salience and Amity salience (r_salience = 0.48). This suggests that grievance is not simply a negative emotion but a tool used to build in-group solidarity and offer a vision of hope for that group. Cory Booker's speech exemplifies this, pairing a grievance-based claim—"we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent"—with a call for unity: "we still live in a a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us" (Source: `cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt`).

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition: Emotional Archetypes

K-Means clustering identified three distinct emotional archetypes within the corpus, revealing the underlying strategic patterns of political communication.

**Cluster 0: The 'Negative/Antagonistic' Climate**
*   **Profile:** High Fear (M=0.80), moderate Enmity (M=0.50), and near-zero scores for all positive emotions (Hope, Amity, Compersion).
*   **Documents:** `mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt`, `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`.
*   **Interpretation:** This is a purely oppositional climate focused on articulating threat and moral condemnation without offering a positive, collaborative vision. The language is one of solemn duty in the face of corruption or danger. Mitt Romney's speech on impeachment fits this archetype perfectly, as he anticipates backlash while framing his decision as a moral necessity: "I’m aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision... Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine" (Source: `mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt`).

**Cluster 1: The 'Mixed Negative with High Envy' Climate**
*   **Profile:** High scores across most negative dimensions (Fear M=0.78, Enmity M=0.77, Envy M=0.80) but also containing significant positive elements (Hope M=0.61, Amity M=0.68). Compersion is notably low (M=0.16).
*   **Documents:** `john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington.txt`, `cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt`, `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`, `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`, `jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference.txt`.
*   **Interpretation:** This is the dominant archetype in the corpus, representing a complex populist or activist stance. It works by identifying an enemy and stoking grievance while simultaneously offering hope and solidarity to a defined in-group. This pattern is remarkably consistent across time and ideology. For instance, Bernie Sanders identifies an oligarchic enemy—"They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare... in order to make themselves even richer" (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`)—while Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez offers a vision of in-group solidarity: "If you are willing to fight for someone you don’t know, you are welcome here" (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This same structure appears in John Lewis's 1963 speech, which vows to "splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy" (Source: `john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington.txt`), blending enmity with a hopeful vision.

**Cluster 2: The 'Positive/Collaborative' Climate**
*   **Profile:** Very low negative emotions (Fear M=0.20, Enmity M=0.00) and high positive emotions (Hope M=0.70, Amity M=0.90, Compersion M=0.90).
*   **Documents:** `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`.
*   **Interpretation:** This archetype is defined by conciliation, grace, and a focus on national unity. It is the emotional signature of de-escalation and democratic sportsmanship. As the sole document in this cluster, John McCain's speech is a clear outlier. Its purpose is to unify the country after a divisive election, urging supporters to "believe always in the promise and greatness of America" and commending his opponent for "inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans" (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`). The rarity of this cluster suggests that this emotional strategy may be reserved for specific rhetorical situations like concession speeches.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The ECF v10 framework proved highly effective for this analysis. Its primary strengths are:
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully distinguished between nuanced emotional strategies, leading to the identification of three coherent and interpretable clusters. The ECI metric, in particular, provided a clear and effective summary of a document's overall emotional valence.
*   **Construct Validity:** The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions (e.g., Enmity vs. Compersion, Fear vs. Hope) provide empirical support for the framework's theoretical design. The axes appear to capture meaningful psychological and rhetorical trade-offs.
*   **Revealing Novel Insights:** The inclusion of less-commonly studied dimensions like Envy and Compersion was critical. The Envy-Hope correlation and the extremely low prevalence of Compersion were two of the most significant findings, which a more traditional framework might have missed.

The primary limitation in this application was not the framework itself but the lack of metadata, which prevented a deeper analysis of how these emotional climates correlate with external variables like ideology or political party.

## 6. Discussion

This analysis of a small but diverse corpus of political speeches reveals that the emotional landscape of American political discourse is not a simple binary of positive versus negative. Instead, the most prevalent emotional strategy is a complex, mixed-motive appeal that we have termed the **'Mixed Negative with High Envy'** climate. This finding has significant theoretical implications. It suggests that much of modern political mobilization, across different eras and ideologies, operates on a logic of constructive grievance: it uses fear of a threat, enmity toward a defined foe, and envy over an unjust distribution of resources as the engine to build in-group solidarity and inspire a specific, targeted form of hope.

The dominance of this archetype (Cluster 1) suggests it is a highly effective and adaptable communication strategy. Its presence in speeches from the Civil Rights movement, contemporary progressive activism, and national conservatism indicates a shared structural logic, even if the targets of enmity and the beneficiaries of hope differ. This populist emotional grammar—defining an "us" by its opposition to a "them" and its claim to a stolen future—appears to be a central feature of impactful political speech.

The most profound finding may be the near-total rhetorical exclusion of **Compersion** when **Enmity** is emphasized (r_salience = -0.91). This suggests a fundamental hydraulic relationship: the cognitive and rhetorical space dedicated to identifying enemies leaves little room for celebrating the successes of others, particularly those outside the in-group. The corpus-wide deficit in Compersion points to a potential erosion of the emotional basis for a positive-sum, pluralistic society. When political discourse is structured around envy and enmity, the very language of shared success may become inaccessible.

The outlier archetypes are equally instructive. The 'Positive/Collaborative' climate (Cluster 2), exemplified by John McCain's concession, appears to be a highly specialized "civic ritual" language, deployed to de-escalate conflict and reaffirm democratic norms. Its rarity suggests it is not a standard mode of political competition. Conversely, the 'Negative/Antagonistic' climate (Cluster 0), seen in speeches by Mitt Romney and Steve King, represents a "prophetic minority" stance, where a speaker stands on principle against a perceived overwhelming corruption, sacrificing broad appeal for moral clarity.

Future research should seek to validate these findings on a much larger corpus. With sufficient data and metadata, it would be possible to test whether the prevalence of these archetypes has shifted over time or differs systematically between political parties or ideological movements. For example, is the 'Mixed Negative' climate a recent phenomenon, or has it always been a staple of American political rhetoric? Does one party rely more heavily on the Enmity/Envy pairing than another? This preliminary analysis provides a strong theoretical and methodological foundation for exploring these critical questions.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, guided by the Emotional Climate Framework (ECF v10), successfully identified and characterized the dominant emotional signatures in a key sample of American political discourse. The central contribution is the identification of a pervasive **'Mixed Negative with High Envy'** archetype, a complex emotional strategy that fuels political mobilization by blending grievance and threat with in-group hope and solidarity.

The study confirmed the ECF framework's construct validity, demonstrating its ability to capture the nuanced and often contradictory emotional textures of political language. The powerful inverse relationship discovered between Enmity and Compersion provides a stark, quantifiable insight into the rhetorical trade-offs that shape public discourse. While limited by a small sample size, these findings are highly suggestive. They point to a political environment where the language of grievance and conflict is more common and structurally central than the language of shared success. The ECF framework offers a robust tool for future research to explore the dynamics and consequences of this emotional climate on a larger scale.
