    "analysis_notes": "The document presents a highly structured rhetorical argument. It strongly frames the existing criminal justice system as a societal crisis (Fear) and a source of profound, targeted injustice (Envy). This negative framing is counterbalanced by an equally strong appeal to bipartisan unity (Amity) and the chance for redemptive progress (Hope). The speaker actively celebrates the contributions of colleagues and activists (Compersion) while deliberately avoiding personal attacks or creating hostility (low Enmity), focusing criticism on the system itself."
