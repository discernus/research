Its primary emotional climate is characterized by very high levels of Amity and Compersion, as the speaker congratulates his opponent and calls for national unity. Hope is a significant secondary theme, while Fear is present only as a mild acknowledgment of national challenges. Enmity and Envy are completely absent, which is central to the speech's purpose."
