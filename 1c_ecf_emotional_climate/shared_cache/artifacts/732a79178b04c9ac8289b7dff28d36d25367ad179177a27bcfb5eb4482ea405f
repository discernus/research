Mauricio Hernandez, a sexual predator who impregnated a 13-year-old daughter of his living girlfriend. And took this repeatedly, had sexual relations with her in ways that I won't repeat here on the floor. Took her off to soccer games where he gave. He also gave her an abortion inducing drug. And she went into into a porta pot and had the baby that was alive. And then he went in and saw that baby. And this girl was then hauled home. The baby was left to die. That baby died. Mauricio Hernandez is the perpetrator. He's another illegal alien. Another one who had been encountered by law. Another one that had been granted this de facto amnesty because of the President's policy.",
