The speaker, Cory Booker, employs a clear rhetorical structure. He first establishes a climate of 'fear' and 'envy' by detailing the failures and injustices of the current criminal justice system. He then pivots to a climate of 'hope' and 'amity' by presenting the bipartisan bill as a collaborative first step toward redemption and reform. 'Compersion' is used at the outset to reinforce the 'amity' frame by praising colleagues across the aisle. 'Enmity' is present but directed at the abstract 'system' rather than political opponents.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.85,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.85,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"enmity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.4,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"amity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"envy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"compersion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"fear\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"Metaphorical language emphasizing existential threat\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"fear\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound.
