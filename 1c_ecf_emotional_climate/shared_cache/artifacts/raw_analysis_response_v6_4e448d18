    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the emotional climate generated by the speech, which is characterized by a strong sense of urgency and dissatisfaction. The dominant emotions are fear, stemming from ongoing violence and lack of protection, and enmity, directed at a failing political system and specific segregationist leaders. These are counterbalanced by a strong appeal to amity (in-group solidarity) and a conditional hope rooted in revolutionary action, not passive optimism. Envy is present in the critique of economic exploitation, while compersion is entirely absent."
