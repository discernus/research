The document exhibits a strong, populistic, and conflict-oriented emotional climate. It starkly contrasts an 'oligarch' out-group with a 'working class' in-group. The dominant dimensions are Enmity and Envy directed at the out-group, and Amity used for in-group mobilization. Fear is present as a consequence of the out-group's actions, while Hope is presented as the potential outcome of collective struggle.
