    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the emotional climate created by a speech characterized by a solemn, principled, and conscience-driven tone. The speaker, Mitt Romney, navigates a complex emotional landscape, balancing a severe condemnation of actions (Fear) with appeals to institutional faith (Hope) and collegiality (Amity), while acknowledging the inevitable political backlash (Enmity). The scoring reflects this nuanced and often conflicted emotional posture, rather than a single-minded rhetorical strategy."
