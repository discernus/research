The dominant dimensions are Envy/Grievance and Enmity, directed at political and media elites, and Fear concerning immigration and foreign policy. These are counter-balanced with appeals to in-group Amity (nationalist solidarity) and Hope for political change led by a specific figure. Compersion is almost entirely absent."
