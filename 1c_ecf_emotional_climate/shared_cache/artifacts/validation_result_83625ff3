    "The 2x3 factorial corpus design is incomplete. The cell for Ideology='Conservative' and Era='Civil Rights' contains zero documents. A two-way ANOVA requires data in every cell of the factorial design.",
    "The total sample size (N=8) and the severe imbalance of documents across factorial cells (e.g., n=1, n=0, n=2) are insufficient for the claimed 'sophisticated emotional climate interaction analysis' and two-way ANOVA. Discernus platform guidelines indicate that a sample of this size is appropriate only for qualitative case study analysis, not robust statistical testing.",
    "The framework specification file `ecf_v10.md` contains an internal versioning inconsistency. The metadata specifies `framework_version: \"1.0.0\"` while the `spec_version` is \"10.0\" and the filename implies v10.",
    "There is a minor discrepancy in the definition of the 'Populist Era' between the experiment and corpus files. The `experiment.md` prose states the era is '2022-2025', while the `corpus.md` prose and its contents define it as '2017-2025'."
