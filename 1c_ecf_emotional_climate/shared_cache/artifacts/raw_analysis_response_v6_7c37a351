    "analysis_notes": "Analyzed John Lewis's 1963 March on Washington speech, focusing on the six emotional dimensions. The speech exhibits high levels of Fear, Enmity, and Envy due to its strong critique of systemic oppression and call for immediate change. Hope is present as a driving force for the revolution, and Amity within the movement. Compassion towards 'others' (outside the movement) is absent."
