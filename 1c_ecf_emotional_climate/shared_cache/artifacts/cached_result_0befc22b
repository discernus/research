      "description": "The experiment's primary statistical test, a two-way ANOVA, is not executable due to insufficient sample sizes within the factorial design cells. Multiple cells in the 2x3 (Ideology x Era) design have only a single observation (n=1).",
      "impact": "The system cannot calculate within-group variance for cells with n=1, making it mathematically impossible to compute the F-statistic for the ANOVA. The experiment will fail during the statistical analysis stage. This violates the 'Statistical Executability Requirements' of the Experiment v10.0 specification, which mandates n\u22652 for all groups in an ANOVA.",
      "fix": "To perform a two-way ANOVA, each of the 6 cells in the design matrix must contain at least two documents. Augment the corpus to ensure the 'Civil Rights / Progressive', 'Civil Rights / Conservative', and 'Institutional / Progressive' cells each have at least one additional document.",

      "impact": "According to the Experiment Specification v10.0, a sample size of N=4-9 is only appropriate for 'Case study analysis, qualitative patterns, individual document insights.' Hypothesis testing is not permitted for N<10. The analysis will be blocked to prevent generating statistically invalid or meaningless results.",
      "fix": "Either increase the total corpus size to meet the minimum requirements for the desired statistical tests (N\u226520 for limited inferential testing) or change the 'Research Questions' and 'Expected Outcomes' to focus on descriptive analysis, pattern analysis, and qualitative insights, removing the plan for a two-way ANOVA.",

      "impact": "This creates ambiguity about the intended composition of the corpus. While the system will prioritize the machine-readable YAML manifest, this discrepancy indicates a lack of quality control and must be resolved for clarity and reproducibility.",

      "impact": "This is misleading and suggests a misunderstanding of the experimental design. While unbalanced ANOVAs are possible, they require different statistical assumptions and the design should be described accurately. It reduces confidence in the research design's rigor.",
