# Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v7.3

The Emotional Climate Framework provides a systematic approach to evaluating the emotional atmosphere generated by political discourse through analysis of six fundamental emotional dimensions that shape the psychological environment for audiences.

## Raison d'Être

Political discourse creates emotional climates that profoundly influence how audiences process information, make decisions, and engage with democratic processes. These emotional atmospheres can either facilitate constructive democratic dialogue or contribute to polarization and dysfunction. This framework provides a rigorous methodology for measuring the psychological environment created by political communication, independent of rhetorical strategy or speaker character.

## Research Foundations

This framework is grounded in:
- **Affective Psychology**: How emotions influence cognitive processing and decision-making
- **Political Psychology**: Emotional dimensions of political behavior and attitude formation
- **Communication Theory**: How discourse creates emotional environments for audiences
- **Social Psychology**: Group emotional dynamics and collective affective states

## Dimensions and Axes

The framework evaluates political discourse across three bipolar axes that form the foundation of emotional climate:

### Threat-Opportunity Axis: Fear ↔ Hope
- **Fear (0.0-1.0)**: Language emphasizing danger, threat, vulnerability, crisis, or existential risk that creates anxiety and defensive psychological states
- **Hope (0.0-1.0)**: Language emphasizing positive possibilities, progress, improvement, or achievement potential that creates optimistic and constructive psychological states

### Social Relations Axis: Enmity ↔ Amity
- **Enmity (0.0-1.0)**: Language creating antagonistic atmosphere toward opponents, enemies, or opposing groups that fosters hostility and conflict orientation
- **Amity (0.0-1.0)**: Language fostering positive relationships, cooperation, solidarity, or shared purpose that creates collaborative and inclusive psychological states

### Resource Attitudes Axis: Envy ↔ Compersion
- **Envy (0.0-1.0)**: Language expressing resentment toward others' advantages, success, or privileged positions that creates zero-sum and grievance-based psychological states
- **Compersion (0.0-1.0)**: Language celebrating others' success, merit, achievement, or positive developments that creates abundance-minded and supportive psychological states

## Linguistic Markers

**Critical Note**: These markers represent semantic spaces and conceptual patterns, not keyword lists. Analysts should look for the underlying concepts and meanings expressed through various linguistic forms, not just literal word matches.

### Fear Markers
Look for fear concepts such as:
- Threat language: "danger," "crisis," "under attack," "running out of time," "defenseless"
- Catastrophic framing: "disaster," "collapse," "end of," "destruction," "chaos"
- Vulnerability emphasis: "exposed," "helpless," "at risk," "threatened," "unsafe"

*Consider related semantic expressions - focus on language that creates anxiety, defensive responses, and threat-focused psychological states regardless of specific fears mentioned.*

### Hope Markers
Look for hope concepts such as:
- Opportunity language: "opportunity," "breakthrough," "bright future," "great potential," "optimistic"
- Progress emphasis: "moving forward," "building," "improving," "advancing," "growing"
- Possibility focus: "we can," "achievable," "within reach," "promising," "encouraging"

*Consider related semantic expressions - focus on language that creates optimism, constructive engagement, and opportunity-focused psychological states regardless of specific aspirations mentioned.*

### Enmity Markers
Look for enmity concepts such as:
- Antagonistic language: "enemy," "betrayal," "fight against," "destroy," "combat"
- Conflict framing: "battle," "war," "defeat," "crush," "eliminate"
- Hostility indicators: "hate," "despise," "oppose," "resist," "stand against"

*Consider related semantic expressions - focus on language that creates adversarial, hostile, and conflict-oriented psychological states regardless of specific targets or opponents.*

### Amity Markers
Look for amity concepts such as:
- Cooperative language: "together," "unity," "partnership," "cooperation," "shared values"
- Inclusive framing: "we all," "common ground," "mutual," "collective," "joint"
- Positive relationship indicators: "friendship," "alliance," "support," "collaboration," "harmony"

*Consider related semantic expressions - focus on language that creates collaborative, inclusive, and relationship-building psychological states regardless of specific groups or partnerships mentioned.*

### Envy Markers
Look for envy concepts such as:
- Resentment language: "unfair advantage," "privileged elite," "deserve better," "left behind," "rigged system"
- Grievance framing: "they have it all," "taken from us," "undeserved," "should be ours," "not fair"
- Zero-sum thinking: "their gain, our loss," "limited resources," "winner takes all," "hoarding"

*Consider related semantic expressions - focus on language that creates resentment, grievance-based thinking, and zero-sum psychological states regardless of specific advantages or groups targeted.*

### Compersion Markers
Look for compersion concepts such as:
- Celebration language: "congratulations," "well-deserved," "earned success," "inspiring achievement," "celebration"
- Merit recognition: "talented," "hard-working," "deserving," "accomplished," "excellent"
- Supportive framing: "proud of," "happy for," "celebrate with," "inspired by," "admire"

*Consider related semantic expressions - focus on language that creates supportive, celebratory, and abundance-minded psychological states regardless of specific achievements or individuals celebrated.*

## Analysis Methodology

The framework employs sequential chain-of-thought analysis, examining each emotional axis independently before integration. This approach improves analytical consistency and evidence quality by focusing attention on specific emotional patterns before synthesis.

## Weighting Scheme

**Dynamic Salience Weighting**: Each dimension receives a salience weight (0.0-1.0) based on its centrality to the specific text being analyzed. This allows the framework to adapt to different types of emotional discourse while maintaining analytical rigor.

## Calculated Metrics

### Polarity Scores
- **Emotional Polarity**: (hope + amity + compersion) - (fear + enmity + envy)
- **Threat-Opportunity Balance**: hope - fear
- **Social Relations Balance**: amity - enmity
- **Resource Attitudes Balance**: compersion - envy

### Composite Indices
- **Climate Intensity**: Average of all dimension scores
- **Positive Emotional Index**: Average of positive dimension scores (hope, amity, compersion)
- **Negative Emotional Index**: Average of negative dimension scores (fear, enmity, envy)
- **Salience-Weighted Emotional Polarity**: Polarity score weighted by dimension salience

## Pattern Classifications

### Emotional Climate Profiles
- **Constructive Climate** (≥0.75): Predominantly positive emotional atmosphere fostering engagement
- **Mixed Climate** (0.50-0.74): Balance of positive and negative emotional elements
- **Stressful Climate** (0.25-0.49): Predominantly negative with limited positive emotional elements
- **Toxic Climate** (<0.25): Systematically negative emotional atmosphere inhibiting constructive engagement

### Strategic Patterns
- **Hope-Focused Messaging** (High hope, high salience): Deliberate cultivation of optimistic psychological states
- **Fear-Based Appeals** (High fear, high salience): Strategic deployment of anxiety-inducing rhetoric
- **Unity Building** (High amity, high salience): Emphasis on collaborative and inclusive emotional states
- **Divisive Rhetoric** (High enmity, high salience): Deliberate creation of adversarial emotional climate
- **Emotional Volatility** (High variance across dimensions): Inconsistent emotional messaging

## Reliability and Validity

### Inter-Rater Reliability
Framework designed for high consistency across analysts through:
- Clear operational definitions for each emotional dimension
- Specific linguistic markers and psychological indicators
- Sequential analysis methodology
- Explicit confidence reporting requirements

### Construct Validity
Dimensions grounded in established psychological theory and validated through:
- Affective psychology and emotion research literature
- Political psychology studies on emotional influence
- Empirical testing across diverse political communication contexts
- Expert review by psychology and communication scholars

## Considerations on Bias

### Potential Sources
- **Cultural Bias**: Framework developed within Western emotional expression norms
- **Temporal Bias**: Contemporary emotional patterns may not apply to historical contexts
- **Individual Bias**: Analysts' emotional responses may influence climate assessments
- **Context Bias**: Same language may create different emotional climates in different settings

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Multi-Analyst Review**: Independent analysis by multiple trained emotional climate assessors
- **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Testing framework across different cultural emotional norms
- **Contextual Calibration**: Regular adjustment for different communication contexts
- **Emotional Neutrality Training**: Analyst training in objective emotional climate assessment

## Analytical Layers

### Layer 1: Direct Emotional Content
Explicit emotional language and affective appeals in the text

### Layer 2: Implicit Emotional Atmosphere
Subtle emotional undertones and psychological climate creation

### Layer 3: Audience Emotional Impact
Assessment of likely emotional responses and psychological states generated

## Inter-Framework Relationships

**ECF** provides emotional climate analysis within the Triadic Architecture:
- **With CAF**: ECF analyzes emotional atmosphere while CAF evaluates civic virtue and character
- **With CHF**: ECF focuses on emotional climate while CHF analyzes constitutional institutional health
- **Synthesis Approach**: Human-led integration of emotional, civic, and constitutional analyses for comprehensive democratic discourse assessment
