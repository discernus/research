## 1. Executive Summary

This computational social science analysis examines the emotional climate across a diverse corpus of eight political texts spanning from 1963 to 2025. Using a multi-dimensional emotional framework, this report quantifies and interprets the rhetorical strategies employed by various political figures. The analysis reveals a political landscape characterized by two primary, and largely oppositional, emotional meta-strategies. The first is a positive, constructive strategy rooted in the powerful synergy of **Hope** and **Amity**, which correlates strongly with a positive Emotional Climate Index (ECI). The second is a negative, antagonistic strategy driven by a potent combination of **Fear**, **Enmity**, and **Envy**, which is strongly predictive of a negative ECI.

Statistical analysis provides robust support for the framework's internal construct validity, particularly in its oppositional dimensions. A near-perfect negative correlation between **Enmity** and **Compassion** (r = -0.96) confirms their diametric relationship in this context. However, the relationship between **Hope** and **Fear** (r = -0.49) is more nuanced, suggesting they are not simple opposites but can coexist in complex rhetorical formulations. The data indicates that negative emotions, as a group, are more internally coherent and impactful on the overall climate than positive emotions. The `negative_emotional_index` shows extremely high correlations with its constituent parts—Fear (r = 0.91), Enmity (r = 0.92), and Envy (r = 0.94)—highlighting a tightly clustered "threat narrative."

Based on these findings, the framework demonstrates significant effectiveness in discriminating between different rhetorical postures, identifying preliminary archetypes such as the "Conciliator" (John McCain), the "Antagonist" (Steve King), and the "Pragmatic Crusader" (Cory Booker). Despite the small sample size (N=8), which necessitates caution in generalizing these findings, this analysis showcases the power of computational methods to distill complex emotional strategies into quantifiable patterns and offers a robust foundation for future, larger-scale research into the emotional architecture of political discourse.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of the emotional climate in political discourse reveals several critical patterns:

*   **Two Competing Emotional Logics Dominate Political Rhetoric:** The data reveals two distinct and powerful emotional constellations. A positive-valence strategy tightly clusters **Hope** and **Amity** (e.g., `hope_salience` and `amity_salience` correlate at r = 0.95), focusing on coalition-building. A negative-valence strategy clusters **Fear**, **Enmity**, and **Envy** (e.g., `fear_raw` and `envy_raw` correlate at r = 0.88), focusing on threat narratives. These two logics appear to be the primary drivers of the overall emotional climate.

*   **The Framework's Oppositional Structure is Largely Validated:** The analysis provides strong evidence for the framework's design. The social relations axis shows a powerful inverse relationship between **Enmity** and **Compassion** (r = -0.96), confirming they function as rhetorical opposites. This suggests that as speakers express hostility towards an out-group, they simultaneously suppress language of compassion.

*   **Negative Emotions Form a More Cohesive and Potent Cluster than Positive Emotions:** The `negative_emotional_index` is almost perfectly predicted by its components, with `envy_raw` (r = 0.94), `enmity_raw` (r = 0.92), and `fear_raw` (r = 0.91) forming a tightly-knit triad. This suggests that threat-based rhetoric often relies on activating all three emotions simultaneously. The textual evidence supports this, as seen when one speaker links fear of "criminal aliens" to resentment over their presence, stating, "This President has, has released, his administration has released over 30,000 criminals, criminal aliens onto the streets of America" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

*   **A Positive Emotional Climate is Not Simply the Absence of Negativity:** The case of Cory Booker demonstrates a complex path to a positive climate. His speech, which scores the highest in `climate_intensity` (0.72) and a positive `emotional_climate_index` (0.28), is also high in **Fear** (0.80) and **Envy** (0.70). This indicates that effective positive rhetoric may involve acknowledging and channeling negative emotions (like fear of injustice) towards a hopeful, coalition-oriented solution, rather than simply avoiding them.

*   **Enmity is Expressed as a Critique of Leadership and Competence:** The data suggests that expressions of **Enmity** are not just generic hostility but are often targeted at the perceived failures of governing elites. This is exemplified by one speaker's critique: "That's sort of the perfect encapsulization of the dumbest way to govern our country" (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference.txt). This links enmity directly to a populist critique of institutional failure.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

As per the operational constraints of this analysis, no external academic literature was consulted. The theoretical framework is derived directly from the dimensional structure implied by the provided statistical data. The analysis proceeds by empirically testing the relationships between these dimensions to understand their coherence, oppositions, and overall structure as a system for mapping emotional rhetoric.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs a quantitative, descriptive, and correlational approach to analyze the emotional content of eight political texts. The analytical framework, inferred from the output data, appears to be structured around six core emotional dimensions: **Fear, Hope, Enmity, Amity, Envy, and Compassion**. Each dimension is measured with three metrics: `_raw` (the raw score of the emotion's presence), `_salience` (the score weighted for its importance in the text), and `_confidence` (the model's confidence in the score).

These six core dimensions are further aggregated into three oppositional axes, which form the basis for derived metrics:
1.  **Threat/Opportunity Axis:** Contrasting Fear and Hope.
2.  **Social Relations Axis:** Contrasting Enmity and Amity.
3.  **Resource Attitudes Axis:** Contrasting Envy and Compassion.

From these axes, several high-level metrics are calculated, including a composite `emotional_climate_index` (ECI), which provides a single score for the overall valence of a text, and `climate_intensity`, which measures the total volume of emotional language. The analysis focuses on interpreting descriptive statistics, correlation matrices, and these derived metrics to identify rhetorical patterns and assess the framework's internal validity.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The corpus, titled "Emotional Climate Factorial Analysis Corpus," consists of eight documents. While the provided metadata is incomplete, filenames suggest the texts are political speeches or statements from prominent American figures, including John Lewis, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, JD Vance, and Steve King. The date range of the documents (1963-2025) provides a wide, albeit sparse, temporal scope.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis is based on the statistical results provided, including descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) and a Pearson correlation matrix for all measured and derived variables. The primary methods involve:
1.  **Descriptive Analysis:** Examining the central tendency and dispersion of each emotional dimension to understand the overall character of the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying the strength and direction of relationships between dimensions to test the framework's construct validity (e.g., expecting negative correlations between oppositional emotions) and to uncover rhetorical meta-strategies (e.g., clustering of certain emotions).
3.  **Derived Metric Interpretation:** Analyzing composite scores like the ECI and Climate Intensity to compare the overall rhetorical posture of each document.

A significant constraint of this analysis is the small sample size (N=8). This limits the statistical power and prevents the generalization of findings. Therefore, all conclusions are presented as preliminary and indicative, intended to generate hypotheses for further research rather than to offer definitive proof. The analysis is descriptive and does not perform inferential statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) due to the sample size. All numerical results are reported to two decimal places for consistency, following APA guidelines.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An examination of the descriptive statistics for the core emotional dimensions reveals the general emotional tenor of the corpus. The texts are, on average, characterized by high levels of negative emotion and comparatively lower levels of positive emotion.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Core Emotional Dimensions (Raw Scores)**

| Dimension   | Mean (M) | Standard Deviation (SD) | Minimum | Maximum |
|-------------|:--------:|:-----------------------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Fear        |   0.77   |          0.20           |  0.30   |  0.90   |
| Enmity      |   0.68   |          0.34           |  0.10   |  0.90   |
| Envy        |   0.65   |          0.29           |  0.00   |  0.90   |
| Hope        |   0.62   |          0.27           |  0.10   |  0.90   |
| Amity       |   0.59   |          0.31           |  0.10   |  0.95   |
| Compassion  |   0.23   |          0.36           |  0.00   |  0.80   |

As shown in Table 1, **Fear** (M = 0.77) is the most prevalent emotion on average, followed closely by **Enmity** (M = 0.68) and **Envy** (M = 0.65). In contrast, **Compassion** (M = 0.23) is markedly low, with a median score of 0.00, indicating that half of the documents contained no significant compassion-related language. The standard deviations for **Enmity** (SD = 0.34), **Amity** (SD = 0.31), and especially **Compassion** (SD = 0.36) are high relative to their means, suggesting these dimensions are highly variable across the corpus and thus possess strong discriminatory power in distinguishing between rhetorical styles. Conversely, the consistently high scores for **Fear** indicate it is a more foundational element of the political discourse analyzed here.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a higher-level view of the rhetorical strategy within each document. These metrics distill the complex interplay of the six core emotions into indices of balance, intensity, and overall climate.

**Table 2: Derived Emotional Climate Metrics by Document**

| Document                                           | Emotional Climate Index (ECI) | Climate Intensity | Positive Index | Negative Index |
|----------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| john_mccain_2008_concession.txt                    |              0.77             |        0.51       |      0.88      |      0.13      |
| cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt                |              0.28             |        0.72       |      0.87      |      0.57      |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt |             -0.19             |        0.72       |      0.57      |      0.87      |
| bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt         |             -0.31             |        0.62       |      0.43      |      0.80      |
| jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference.txt                |             -0.40             |        0.63       |      0.38      |      0.88      |
| mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt                   |             -0.40             |        0.45       |      0.23      |      0.67      |
| john_lewis_1963_march_on_washington.txt            |             -0.54             |        0.60       |      0.33      |      0.87      |
| steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt                    |             -0.66             |        0.48       |      0.13      |      0.82      |

The **Emotional Climate Index (ECI)**, which represents the overall positive or negative valence, shows a wide range from a highly positive 0.77 (John McCain) to a highly negative -0.66 (Steve King). This demonstrates the framework's capacity to capture the vast differences in rhetorical tone. John McCain's 2008 concession speech stands out as a significant outlier, with a strongly positive climate driven by high Hope and Amity and low Enmity.

Conversely, the majority of texts exhibit a negative ECI, driven by high scores on the **Negative Emotional Index**. The speeches by Steve King, JD Vance, and John Lewis, despite their different ideological origins and historical contexts, all register a strongly negative climate. This is often accompanied by high **Climate Intensity**, as seen in the speeches by Cory Booker and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (both 0.72), suggesting that emotionally charged rhetoric, whether positive or negative, is a common feature. The data indicates that achieving a positive ECI is the rarer and more difficult rhetorical feat in this sample.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of the emotional framework and the common patterns of co-occurrence among emotions. These relationships form the basis of the rhetorical meta-strategies observed in the corpus.

**Key Correlation Findings:**

*   **Validation of Oppositional Axes:** The framework's structural integrity is strongly supported by the negative correlations between opposing emotions.
    *   **Enmity vs. Compassion:** The strongest oppositional relationship exists between `enmity_raw` and `compassion_raw` (r = -0.96), indicating they are mutually exclusive rhetorical choices within this dataset.
    *   **Enmity vs. Amity:** A similarly strong opposition is found between `enmity_raw` and `amity_raw` (r = -0.57), which strengthens when considering the overall `social_relations_balance` and `positive_emotional_index` (r = 0.97).
    *   **Fear vs. Hope:** The correlation between `fear_raw` and `hope_raw` is negative but more moderate (r = -0.49). This suggests that while they are generally opposed, they are not simple antonyms and can coexist, as seen in Cory Booker's speech.

*   **Positive Emotion Synergy:** The positive emotions display strong synergy.
    *   **Hope and Amity:** `hope_salience` and `amity_salience` are very highly correlated (r = 0.95). This suggests that expressions of hope are almost always coupled with language of unity and coalition-building. This is evident in the language of speakers aiming for broad appeal, such as one who stated, "I'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum" (Source: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt). Another speaker echoed this sentiment, defining their movement by its inclusivity: "If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

*   **Negative Emotion Clustering (The Threat Triad):** The negative emotions form an even tighter and more potent cluster.
    *   **Fear, Enmity, and Envy:** These three emotions are strongly inter-correlated. `fear_raw` correlates with `enmity_raw` (r = 0.72) and `envy_raw` (r = 0.88). This "threat triad" appears to be a common rhetorical strategy for mobilizing grievance, where fear of a threat is linked to hostility towards a responsible party and resentment over perceived injustices or resource misallocations.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns point to a fundamental duality in political emotional strategy. The data strongly suggests that political rhetoric in this corpus organizes itself along a primary axis of **Amity/Hope vs. Enmity/Fear/Envy**.

The **Amity/Hope** strategy is fundamentally constructive and coalitional. Its goal is to create a broad "in-group" by appealing to shared aspirations and a sense of common purpose. The extremely high correlation between the `positive_emotional_index` and `social_relations_balance` (r = 0.97) underscores that a positive emotional climate is almost synonymous with fostering amity over enmity.

Conversely, the **Enmity/Fear/Envy** strategy is deconstructive and factional. It operates by defining a threatening out-group, attributing blame, and stoking resentment. The powerful negative correlation between `resource_attitudes_balance` and the `negative_emotional_index` (r = -0.96) is particularly revealing. It indicates that a negative climate is overwhelmingly driven by a combination of Envy (resentment over resources) and a lack of Compassion. This pattern is vividly illustrated in rhetoric that targets specific groups for causing societal harm. For instance, one speaker's focus on "illegal aliens" combines fear-mongering with a narrative of resource drain and danger: "These incidents of illegal aliens that are, that are arrested and turned loose on the street... is costing lives in America" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This is further compounded by expressions of envy and resentment regarding resource allocation, as another speaker noted: "our leaders have forgotten that and as much as I think that the most significant example of that is, is in Ukraine, uh, where we have sent hundreds of billions of dollars of weaponry" (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference.txt). This quote perfectly fuses enmity towards "leaders" with envy over resources sent abroad.

An unexpected finding is the role of **Enmity** in critiques of governance. The data suggests enmity is not just blind rage but is often framed as a justified response to incompetence. This is clearly articulated in the statement, "no one can avoid that it has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced" (Source: jd_vance_2022_natcon_conference.txt), which directly blames leadership for tangible negative outcomes, thereby legitimizing the hostile stance.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The analytical framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness in several key areas, though with some limitations.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully discriminates between varied rhetorical styles. The wide ranges and high standard deviations in the ECI and most core emotions (especially Enmity, Amity, and Compassion) show its sensitivity to different speakers and contexts. It effectively separates the conciliatory tone of McCain from the antagonistic posture of King and the complex, high-intensity approach of Booker.

*   **Construct Validity and Framework-Corpus Fit:** The strong correlation patterns, particularly the oppositional relationships (Enmity vs. Compassion) and synergistic clusters (Hope/Amity, Fear/Enmity/Envy), suggest a high degree of construct validity. The framework's dimensions map well onto the actual emotional strategies present in the corpus. The prevalence of negative emotions in the results indicates the framework is well-suited for analyzing the often-contentious nature of political discourse. The framework's ability to detect nuanced strategies, such as combining Fear and Hope, further speaks to its sophistication.

*   **Methodological Insights:** The analysis highlights the value of using a multi-dimensional emotional framework over a simple positive/negative sentiment score. A simple sentiment analysis might have miscategorized Cory Booker's speech, which is high in both positive and negative emotions. The framework's derived metrics, like the ECI and balance scores, provide a more holistic and interpretable picture of rhetorical strategy. The `_confidence` scores, while not deeply analyzed here, offer a promising avenue for future research into analytical uncertainty.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications and Archetypal Patterns

The findings from this analysis carry significant theoretical implications for the study of political communication. The identification of two dominant, competing emotional meta-strategies—one coalitional and aspirational (Hope/Amity), the other factional and grievance-based (Fear/Enmity/Envy)—provides an empirical foundation for a dual-process model of political persuasion. This suggests that political actors often make a strategic choice between a rhetoric of "pulling together" and a rhetoric of "pulling apart."

Furthermore, the data allows for the identification of preliminary rhetorical archetypes, which, while needing validation with a larger sample, offer a useful heuristic for understanding political styles:
1.  **The Conciliator (John McCain):** Characterized by a high ECI, high Hope and Amity, and very low Enmity and Envy. This archetype prioritizes national unity and graciousness, even in defeat.
2.  **The Antagonist (Steve King, JD Vance):** Defined by a very low ECI, high Fear, Enmity, and Envy, and low Compassion. This archetype focuses on identifying threats, assigning blame to out-groups (e.g., "criminal aliens") and elites, and stoking resentment.
3.  **The Pragmatic Crusader (Cory Booker):** A complex archetype with high scores across both positive and negative dimensions and high overall intensity. This style acknowledges and validates negative emotions (fear of injustice, enmity towards systemic problems) but channels them towards a hopeful, coalition-based solution.
4.  **The Populist Left (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez):** Marked by a negative ECI, high Enmity and Envy directed at oligarchic structures, but also high Amity towards a broad working-class coalition. This archetype blends antagonism towards an "elite" out-group with strong solidarity for an "in-group."

### Broader Significance and Limitations

This study, despite its limited scope, underscores the potential of computational methods to move beyond simple sentiment analysis and map the complex emotional architecture of political language. It demonstrates that emotions are not just decorative but are deployed in structured, strategic combinations. The finding that negative emotions form a more tightly-knit and potent cluster than positive ones may have sobering implications for the political landscape, suggesting that grievance-based rhetoric may be more internally coherent and easier to deploy effectively.

The primary limitation remains the **small sample size (N=8)**. The identified archetypes and patterns are suggestive, not definitive, and require validation across a much larger and more diverse corpus. Additionally, the lack of a formal framework specification document means our understanding of the dimensions is inferred. Future research should aim to expand the corpus significantly to test the generalizability of these findings, explore changes in emotional rhetoric over time, and investigate how different audiences respond to these distinct emotional strategies.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of eight political texts has successfully identified and quantified key patterns in emotional rhetoric. The findings reveal a political landscape structured around a fundamental conflict between a positive, unifying strategy based on Hope and Amity, and a negative, divisive strategy built on Fear, Enmity, and Envy. The analytical framework proved highly effective, demonstrating strong internal validity and the capacity to discriminate between nuanced rhetorical postures.

The study contributes a set of preliminary but powerful insights: the validation of the framework's oppositional design, the identification of the potent "threat triad" of negative emotions, and the outlining of distinct rhetorical archetypes. While the conclusions must be tempered by the small sample size, this report serves as a robust proof-of-concept. It showcases the value of multi-dimensional emotional analysis and generates a series of testable hypotheses that can guide future, larger-scale investigations into the emotional dynamics that shape our political world.
