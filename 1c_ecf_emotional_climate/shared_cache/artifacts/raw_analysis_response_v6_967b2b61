    "analysis_notes": "The analysis reflects a speech with a very strong in-group/out-group dynamic. High scores for Amity and Hope are directed internally towards the 'national conservative movement' and 'American people,' while high scores for Enmity, Fear, and Envy are directed externally at 'elites,' the 'Biden administration,' and specific media entities. The rhetoric is consistently zero-sum, leading to a near-total absence of Compersion."
