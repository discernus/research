The speaker's rhetoric centers on two primary threats: judicial activism undermining the Constitution and, more prominently, violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The latter argument is supported by graphic, emotional anecdotes. Envy/Grievance is a significant secondary theme, framing the system as unfairly protecting criminals over citizens. Amity is present but limited to an in-group, while Hope and Compersion are almost entirely absent, resulting in a deeply negative and conflict-oriented emotional atmosphere.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"Fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"Hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"Enmity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"Amity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.3,\n          \"salience\": 0.25,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"Envy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"Compersion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Fear\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"...he was beaten mercilessly and bludgeoned and finally murdered and had and then the perpetrator, an illegal alien whom the law enforcement had encountered and released onto the streets of America... beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.98,\n          \"context_type\": \"anecdotal_evidence_of_threat\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Fear\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"And every American that dies at their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our laws.
