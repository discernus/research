Barry Goldwater - 1964 Republican National Convention Speech

[This is a placeholder file for the Barry Goldwater 1964 RNC Convention speech. In a real implementation, this would contain the actual speech transcript. The speech would be analyzed for emotional climate patterns across the fear/hope, enmity/amity, and envy/compersion axes as part of the factorial analysis.]

Key themes that would be present in the actual speech:
- Conservative principles and limited government
- Individual liberty and personal responsibility  
- Opposition to civil rights legislation
- States' rights arguments
- Anti-communist rhetoric
- Traditional American values

This speech represents the conservative perspective during the civil rights era, providing balance to the progressive John Lewis speech in the factorial design.
