## 1. Executive Summary

This report details a computational analysis of strategic communications using the Entman Framing Functions Framework v10.0. The experiment was designed to test Robert Entman's foundational hypothesis that the four functions of framing—Problem Definition, Causal Attribution, Moral Evaluation, and Treatment Recommendation—operate as independent analytical dimensions. The analysis was conducted on a curated corpus of four synthetic strategic communications, including a crisis management statement, a political attack ad, a corporate apology, and a policy advocacy speech.

The central and most significant finding of this study is the preliminary falsification of Entman's independence hypothesis within this corpus. Statistical analysis revealed an extremely strong positive correlation between Causal Attribution and Moral Evaluation (r = 0.978), indicating that these two functions are not deployed independently but rather as a tightly coupled rhetorical package. This suggests that in strategic messaging, the act of assigning blame (Causal Attribution) is almost invariably paired with an ethical judgment (Moral Evaluation), forming a "Blame-and-Shame" strategic pattern. The consistently low Framing Independence Scores across the corpus (M = 0.106) further substantiate this finding, challenging the theoretical premise that the functions are independently variable.

Secondary findings confirm that strategic communicators tailor their framing emphasis based on context. For instance, the analysis identified a significant difference in the intensity of Treatment Recommendation based on communication type, with a political attack ad showing a weaker focus on solutions than crisis or policy documents. Furthermore, the study revealed that Problem Definition serves as a universal and high-intensity entry point for all analyzed communications (M = 0.90, SD = 0.00). While the framework was designed to validate a theory of independence, its primary value in this experiment was in providing robust, empirical evidence of functional *interdependence*, thereby opening new avenues for refining framing theory. Given the pilot nature of this study (N=4), these findings should be considered preliminary but highly suggestive, warranting further investigation with a larger and more diverse corpus.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Framing Functions Exhibit Interdependence, Challenging Theory**: Contrary to the experiment's primary hypothesis, the framing functions did not operate independently. Causal Attribution and Moral Evaluation were almost perfectly correlated (r = 0.978), suggesting that in practice, assigning blame and making a moral judgment are two sides of the same rhetorical coin.
*   **"Blame-and-Shame" Emerges as a Core Rhetorical Strategy**: The tight coupling of Causal Attribution and Moral Evaluation points to a common strategic pattern. Communicators do not simply state who is responsible; they simultaneously frame that responsibility in moral terms. This was evident in both the political attack ad and the corporate apology.
*   **Problem Definition is a Universal Prerequisite**: Across all document types, Problem Definition was consistently the most intense and salient framing function (M = 0.90, SD = 0.00). This indicates that establishing a problem is a non-negotiable first step in strategic communication, setting the stage for all subsequent framing.
*   **Strategic Context Dictates Framing Profiles**: The analysis confirms that the emphasis on different framing functions varies by communication goal. The political attack ad was uniquely "Cause-focused," prioritizing blame, while crisis and policy documents were "Problem-focused." Furthermore, the intensity of Treatment Recommendation was significantly lower in the attack ad (Score = 0.75) compared to other documents (Scores = 0.90).
*   **Messages Strive for Completeness, Not Minimalism**: Despite the potential for selective emphasis, the analyzed messages demonstrated high overall comprehensiveness (Message Completeness Index M = 0.84). This suggests that effective strategic communications tend to construct a full narrative—defining a problem, assigning a cause, offering a moral lens, and proposing a solution—rather than focusing on just one or two functions.
*   **Perfect Coherence Can Signal a Lack of Independence**: The corporate apology registered a perfect Framing Coherence Index (0.90) but a Framing Independence Score of 0.0. This reveals that a perfectly balanced message, where all four functions are deployed with equal intensity, represents the complete absence of selective emphasis and is the antithesis of functional independence.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employed the Entman Framing Functions Framework v10.0, a communication analysis tool designed to empirically test Robert Entman's theory of framing. The framework operationalizes this theory by deconstructing discourse into four distinct, theoretically independent functions:

1.  **Problem Definition**: Identifying and conceptualizing issues requiring attention.
2.  **Causal Attribution**: Assigning responsibility and explaining the origins of a problem.
3.  **Moral Evaluation**: Invoking values and providing an ethical or moral judgment.
4.  **Treatment Recommendation**: Advocating for specific solutions or policy directions.

For each document, every function was scored for both **Intensity** (the strength and frequency of the frame, 0.0-1.0) and **Salience** (the strategic prominence of the frame, 0.0-1.0). The analysis also generated five derived metrics, including the **Message Completeness Index**, **Framing Coherence Index**, and, most critically for this study, the **Framing Independence Score**, which measures the standard deviation of the four function scores to quantify their empirical independence.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The corpus consisted of four synthetic documents designed to represent diverse strategic communication contexts:
*   **crisis_management.txt**: A corporate response to a data breach.
*   **political_attack_ad.txt**: A negative campaign advertisement.
*   **corporate_apology.txt**: A corporate statement following an environmental incident.
*   **policy_advocacy.txt**: A political speech advocating for healthcare reform.

This corpus, while small, was intentionally designed to provide sufficient variation in framing patterns to test the framework's analytical capabilities and the experiment's core hypotheses.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis relied on descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation analysis, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to identify patterns and test hypotheses. All statistical results provided by the computational system were treated as definitive for the purposes of this report.

A primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=4). Consequently, all findings, particularly those from inferential statistics, must be interpreted as preliminary and suggestive rather than conclusive proof. The conclusions drawn are specific to this corpus and serve as a pilot for generating hypotheses for larger-scale research. The academic tone is intentionally cautious to reflect this constraint.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The analysis yielded dimensional scores and derived metrics for each of the four documents. Table 1 presents the mean and standard deviation for each of the four core framing functions across the corpus. A notable finding is the complete lack of variance for Problem Definition, which scored 0.90 in every document. Causal Attribution showed the most variance (SD = 0.30), indicating it was the most selectively deployed function.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Framing Function Intensity Scores**
| Framing Function           | Mean | Standard Deviation | Minimum | Maximum |
|----------------------------|------|--------------------|---------|---------|
| Problem Definition         | 0.90 | 0.00               | 0.90    | 0.90    |
| Causal Attribution         | 0.74 | 0.30               | 0.30    | 0.95    |
| Moral Evaluation           | 0.88 | 0.05               | 0.80    | 0.90    |
| Treatment Recommendation   | 0.86 | 0.08               | 0.75    | 0.90    |

Table 2 displays the key derived metrics, which quantify the overall structure of the messages. The mean Message Completeness Index (0.84) and Framing Coherence Index (0.83) are high, suggesting that, on average, the communications were comprehensive and balanced. The most critical metric, the Framing Independence Score, had a low mean of 0.106, providing the first piece of evidence that the functions did not vary independently as hypothesized.

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for Derived Metrics**
| Derived Metric             | Mean  | Standard Deviation | Minimum | Maximum |
|----------------------------|-------|--------------------|---------|---------|
| Message Completeness Index | 0.844 | 0.080              | 0.725   | 0.900   |
| Framing Coherence Index    | 0.827 | 0.110              | 0.664   | 0.900   |
| Framing Independence Score | 0.106 | 0.126              | 0.000   | 0.287   |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The **Framing Independence Score** provides the most direct test of the study's primary hypothesis. A score near zero indicates that all four functions were deployed with similar intensity, showing a lack of independent variation. A higher score indicates that some functions were emphasized while others were downplayed. The `corporate_apology.txt` yielded a Framing Independence Score of 0.0, as all four functions scored an identical 0.90. This represents a perfectly coherent but completely interdependent message, where the communicator chose to address all aspects of the frame equally. In contrast, the `crisis_management.txt` had the highest score (0.287), driven by its strong emphasis on Problem Definition (0.9) and Treatment Recommendation (0.9) but very weak Causal Attribution (0.3). This document comes closest to demonstrating the selective function deployment predicted by Entman's theory.

The high mean **Message Completeness Index** (0.844) is also revealing. It suggests that even when making strategic choices, communicators in this corpus tended to construct complete narratives. Rather than omitting functions entirely, they modulated their intensity. For example, even the political attack ad, which was heavily focused on blame, included a non-trivial Treatment Recommendation (0.75), demonstrating an attempt to cover all four framing bases.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The most significant finding of this study emerges from the correlation analysis between the four framing functions, which was intended to test the primary hypothesis (H1) of functional independence. The results, presented in Table 3, directly challenge this hypothesis.

**Table 3: Correlation Matrix of Framing Function Intensity Scores**
|                            | Problem Definition | Causal Attribution | Moral Evaluation | Treatment Recommendation |
|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Problem Definition**     | 1.00               | ---                | ---              | ---                      |
| **Causal Attribution**     | ---                | 1.00               | **0.978***       | -0.475                   |
| **Moral Evaluation**       | ---                | **0.978***         | 1.00             | -0.333                   |
| **Treatment Recommendation** | ---                | -0.475             | -0.333           | 1.00                     |
*Note: p < 0.001. Correlations involving Problem Definition could not be calculated due to zero variance.*

The analysis reveals a near-perfect positive correlation between Causal Attribution and Moral Evaluation (r = 0.978). This extremely strong, statistically significant relationship indicates that as the intensity of assigning blame increases, so does the intensity of moral judgment. This finding falsifies the prediction that the functions would operate as independent dimensions with low correlations. Instead, they appear to function as a tightly integrated pair.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns reveal a structured, rather than ad hoc, approach to strategic communication that runs counter to the theory of functional independence.

#### The "Blame-and-Shame" Rhetorical Package

The strong correlation between Causal Attribution and Moral Evaluation is not just a statistical artifact; it reflects a potent rhetorical strategy evident in the texts. Communicators consistently bundled the assignment of responsibility with a moral verdict. For instance, the corporate apology does not merely state the cause but immediately frames it as a moral failing. As GreenEnergy Corp stated: "Our investigation has determined that the chemical spill was caused by equipment failure that we should have prevented... This failure represents a breach of our core values and our commitment to environmental stewardship" (Source: corporate_apology.txt). Here, the causal statement ("equipment failure") is inextricably linked to the moral evaluation ("breach of our core values").

Similarly, the political attack ad masterfully fuses these two functions to discredit an opponent. It first assigns causal blame for societal problems, stating, "His policies have destroyed jobs, raised taxes, and left families struggling to make ends meet," and then immediately pivots to a harsh moral judgment: "His moral character is questionable. He's been caught in multiple ethics violations... He represents everything that's wrong with Washington politics" (Source: political_attack_ad.txt). In these contexts, separating cause from moral judgment would weaken the message; their power lies in their fusion.

#### Problem Definition as the Universal Antecedent

The analysis shows that Problem Definition is a constant, high-intensity feature across all documents (M = 0.90, SD = 0.00). Every strategic communication, regardless of its ultimate goal, begins by establishing the existence and nature of a problem.
*   **Crisis Management**: "We are writing to inform you of a serious data security incident that occurred on September 14, 2025" (Source: crisis_management.txt).
*   **Political Attack**: "Senator Johnson's opponent has a record of failure and corruption that threatens our community" (Source: political_attack_ad.txt).
*   **Corporate Apology**: The message is framed around "the environmental incident that occurred at our facility" (Source: corporate_apology.txt).
*   **Policy Advocacy**: "My fellow Americans, today I want to talk about a crisis that affects every family in this country - our broken healthcare system" (Source: policy_advocacy.txt).

This uniformity suggests that Problem Definition is not just one of four equal functions but may be a prerequisite for the effective deployment of the other three.

#### Strategic Differentiation in Function Deployment

While interdependence was the dominant pattern, the analysis also confirmed the second hypothesis (H2), finding that communicators do make strategic choices based on context. The ANOVA test for Treatment Recommendation was significant (p = 0.0), driven by the lower score in the political attack ad. The ad's "solution" is vague and electoral: "Senator Johnson stands for integrity, family values, and real solutions. Don't let corruption win. Vote Johnson for Senate" (Source: political_attack_ad.txt). This contrasts sharply with the highly specific solutions offered in the policy advocacy speech: "Our solution is comprehensive healthcare reform that: Provides universal coverage for all Americans; Controls prescription drug costs; Expands mental health services..." (Source: policy_advocacy.txt). This confirms that a message designed to attack an opponent invests less rhetorical energy in detailed solutions than a message designed to advocate for a specific policy.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The Entman Framing Functions Framework v10.0 proved highly effective, though not in the way originally anticipated. Its core innovation—the ability to measure the independence of framing functions—was precisely what allowed for the empirical falsification of its underlying theoretical premise within this corpus. The framework's derived metrics, particularly the **Framing Independence Score**, provided a novel and powerful quantitative tool for moving beyond qualitative description to empirical testing of framing theory.

The framework demonstrated high discriminatory power. It successfully distinguished between the "Cause-focused" strategy of the political attack ad and the "Problem-focused" strategies of other documents. It also quantified the subtle but significant difference in solution-orientation between document types. The framework-corpus fit was excellent, as the corpus was designed to exercise its dimensions, and the resulting analysis produced clear, interpretable, and theoretically significant patterns. The framework's value lies not in confirming a decades-old theory but in providing the tools to refine and challenge it with empirical data.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis have significant implications for framing theory and the study of strategic communication. The preliminary falsification of Entman's independence hypothesis suggests that the four framing functions may not be best understood as a modular toolkit of independent components. Instead, certain functions may be structurally linked in practice, forming common rhetorical "packages" or "archetypes." The "Blame-and-Shame" pattern (Causal Attribution + Moral Evaluation) identified in this study is a prime candidate for such an archetype.

This does not invalidate Entman's identification of the four functions, but it does challenge their purported independence. It may be that in the context of high-stakes strategic communication, messages require a level of narrative coherence that forces these functions to work in concert. Ascribing blame without moral judgment may seem incomplete or evasive, while making a moral judgment without a causal anchor may appear baseless. Their interdependence may be a feature of effective persuasion, not a flaw in message construction.

The universal presence of high-intensity Problem Definition also suggests a potential hierarchy among the functions. Rather than four co-equal dimensions, Problem Definition may act as a gateway frame that enables the others. Future research could investigate this possibility, exploring whether the intensity of Problem Definition predicts the overall completeness or coherence of the message.

The primary limitation of this study is its reliance on a small (N=4) and synthetic corpus. While this design provided a controlled environment for a pilot test, the findings cannot be generalized. The strong patterns observed here, however, generate a clear and testable hypothesis for future research: *In strategic communication, Causal Attribution and Moral Evaluation are interdependent functions, and their correlation will be consistently high across diverse, naturally occurring corpora.* Future studies should apply this framework to a large-N corpus of real-world political, corporate, and media texts to see if the patterns of interdependence identified here hold at scale.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis set out to test the independence of Entman's four framing functions and, in doing so, uncovered compelling preliminary evidence of their interdependence. The central finding—an extremely strong positive correlation between Causal Attribution and Moral Evaluation—directly contradicts a core tenet of framing theory and suggests that strategic communicators often bundle these functions into a cohesive "Blame-and-Shame" narrative package.

The study successfully demonstrated the utility of the Entman Framing Functions Framework v10.0 as a tool for empirical theory testing. By operationalizing the concept of independence, the framework enabled a rigorous, data-driven evaluation that moves beyond descriptive analysis. While the findings challenge the theory the framework is based on, this is a sign of methodological strength, not weakness. It highlights the power of computational social science to not only apply theories but to actively refine, challenge, and advance them. This pilot study provides a firm foundation and a clear, falsifiable hypothesis for future, larger-scale research into the structural patterns of strategic communication.
