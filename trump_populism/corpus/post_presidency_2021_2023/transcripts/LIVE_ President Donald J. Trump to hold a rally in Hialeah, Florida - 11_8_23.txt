================================================================================

 you you you you you you you you you you you You did mention that there is a GOP debate going on right now, and we can talk a lot about what we think should be happening right now in the Republican Party. And I've got some strong takes on that. I'll say that for later. But this is a very heavily Hispanic area. This is a largely majority Hispanic area here in South Florida. And so there was a reason why President Trump specifically targeted this area for today, is not only is he leading and gaining supporters from he had the previous election, not only in the African American community, but also in the Hispanic community as well. And you said you got Latinos for Trump down there. This is a very stronghold section of Florida for President Trump. It really is, and as you mentioned President Trump is gaining. And a lot of these key demographics, particularly here in South Florida, a lot of the Hispanic community is Catholic and have a lot of Catholic family values. And the woke principles just don't jive with Catholic values or Christian, Judeo-Christian values. And so we're seeing a lot of this shift, particularly in the Hispanic community, particularly in the Black community. And I think that's threatening. I've even seen reports from New York Times, some of the mainstream left-leaning media saying that Donald Trump is making up ground in the Black community. Now are they doing that to give Donald Trump the credit that he's doing it to say Joe Biden needs to go because they're now seem to be circling the wagons on Joe Biden. It's unclear at this point what they're going to do. But certainly this is a key demographic. As you mentioned, the Latinos for Trump, the popular song that came out recently, the artist are here. They're performing down the way a little bit. And the line wraps all the way around the block. I guess that I didn't even get to see the end of it. I expect this to grow consistently throughout the day as people get off work. And then tonight I think it's going to be pretty, pretty fun. Yeah, pretty fun. Of course, he takes a stage at 7 o'clock. Let me show the line real quick. I talk about a good friends over at the Birch Gold Group. Now, this whole replacement on the digital dollar is coming. And it comes to savings. It comes to your investments. You want to make sure they were all protected. And our friends over at the Birch Gold Group want to help you do that right now for this rally. They have a very, very special offer. They want to get it over to you. So listen up, when you open up a gold IRA for every 10,000 you spend by December 22nd, the Birch Gold Group will send you a free gold bar. Just text the words right now. Trump to 9898, that's Trump to 989898, the claim of eligibility now. The Birch Gold Group can help you convert an existing RRA 401k into a gold back RRA with no money out of pocket and get this. You still get the gold bar. Right now, text Trump to 989898, that is the Birch Gold Group. As you can see, we've got a lot of people out here lined up nice and early all getting ready. Thank you very much. Sorry, well, how are we doing? We're doing great. This is my second rally. First time up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where we are intimidated by antifa type people. And here it's so much more fun. No one is going to intimidate a Trump supporter. I can tell you that. I don't care where you're at. How many people are actually skipping work today to come out here? Raise your hand. I would be skipping work as well to come out here. Every rally, and I see most of them and the intro before all the pregame with watching you. Most rallies sold. That's great. This is the best part of the rally, all the pre show. So as far as Joe Biden is concerned, what is happening in your life that's been a direct result of something he's done? Well, I've watched my towns where I lived up north be totally infiltrated. And so I think it's the border, the border baby. I mean, that's got to, it has to stop. We have to shut the border down. So I'm just not putting American people first. And I see that just the discouragement and just the, you know, people are just sick of it. They're over it. I think people are sick of, well, not only Joe Biden's policies, but our Congress and they're in Senate. We're not putting America first. I can go in and ran on that and I will a little bit later. I know. You do. You do a great job. So what do we miss about President Trump? What do we, if he was to come into office on first day, what would you want him to do? Just making America's, Americans feel like this is the place where they belong and not feeling like they're, you know, castesides in their own country. I just think restoring America to what we were promised in the Constitution, he upholds everything, you know, I just think just restoring, it's so corny, but hope and just what we're here to do as Americans and all the we, the people throughout the world. Just get us away from establishment, globalist type policies that are not putting Americans and we the people first. To me, that's what it's about. And he always says, you know, they're coming after me because I'm standing for you. And that's what it is, we the people in America and all over the world. You feel confident, your family, your circle of family, friends, co-workers, where you are. I don't feel like they're being, they will be protected, the dreams, the hopes of my kids, but I look in how I was raised and the opportunities I had coming out of college and my kids don't have the same America that we had. And that just makes me sad. I just turned 54 a couple of days ago and I don't feel like this is the country that I had and I was 24. It's dramatically changed. All right. Thank you so much for coming out here. What you do, we love your show, you're brilliant, we love your analysis. Yeah, she's great. Christina Bob's the best. I'll hand over to you. Do you have somebody you want to talk to as well? Yeah, absolutely. I always love a Trump supporter that can wear pearls and leggings and jeans. That's amazing. Very well done. All right. We've got some folks here. What's your name and where you guys from? I'm Sarah's pitchford. I was born in Chicago, but I just moved out here from California. You moved to Florida from California. What brought you out to Florida? Really, really state. When I was living in California, COVID shut down my business. So I had to come out here and focus on my realistic. I had a clothing line out in California. And Gavin Newsom, he wasn't trying to open everything up. So I had to move out here all the way from California and open up shop here. And how is life in Florida different better, were same? How is it compared to California right now? It's a lot better policy wise. I don't get my card told every single day. Yeah, it's a lot of illegal things that go on out in California. And I think the people that run and operate California, they pretty much allow and enable a lot of illegal activity. Even when it comes down to the drugs, living not too far from Scarrow, I was living in West Hollywood. Scarrow was about like 10, 15 minutes away from me. And those people, they had nowhere else to go. And at a point, I was even working with the governor to actually get people house. Because in California, there's a lot of abandoned malls. So we were going to convert the malls into shelters. He just got funded from Trump to actually house the people there. And he suggested that it'd be cheaper if he was to keep giving out 10s. So it wasn't quite working the way you hoped it would play out. Is that right? Well, at the end of the day, it doesn't blow it down to me. As much as I want to help, I'm only allowed to do what I can do. So if I want to make sure I understand, you were trying to basically create shelters for people who needed a place to live in California. And California was making that pretty difficult to do. And there's talks of Gavin Newsom last minute throwing his hat in the ring for President. What do you think about that? I personally think the guy is like Patrick Bateman, social paths, real slick talker too. The guy is, he's just full of shit. Full of shit. All right. What brought you out here today to see President Trump? I've always been a Trump supporter. I know he has an ego like mine. And you're going to have a lot of haters when you have a, you know, not an ego, but when you get shit done, people are going to hate. So I understand where he's coming from. Do you have, is there one aspect or policy of his that you like better than others? Or you just like him as a whole like his persona? A lot of his policies. I like his ego, but I really like he's a businessman, because I'm a businessman too. And I like he's for everybody, not just for the businessman. So I think with everything going on now where people are struggling, you know, the inflation with cars, groceries, he's the guy, and even with the wars, I'm a veteran as well. So even with the wars going on, we shouldn't be having to repeat this stuff if they really cared about the people. Well, thank you for your service. I hope you have a wonderful time at the rally today. Brian, we got a bunch of good folks, a lot of different backgrounds and a lot of different reasons to be out supporting President Trump today. And you know what's guys, I, we're live on there, but you come on, let's take a picture real quick. And she says right side. Thank you. Thank you. Oh my God. Thank you very much. Thank you. And then really America needs to open their eyes and vote for Trump. We don't want socialism here. Okay. So America, America, great again. Vote them. I'm sorry. Vote Republican. We're Republican. Yeah. Absolutely. That fits a lot. Okay. I'm going to talk to this gentleman right over here. I walked up and he says, you know, I would have been watching you guys since you were doing it on a cell phone. Even before Liz Willis, before I was here on a cell phone, I want to thank you for coming up to and really been watching us for almost day one. Oh, yeah. Well, it's funny because you know, Trump used to do rallies and there'd be nobody. You'd be the only ones there. And I kept saying, does Trump know about these people? He never talked about you. He never mentioned you. And I thought he needs to know about these people because they're covering all these rallies. But equipment sometimes should be like, they'd have trouble broadcasting. They'd walk down with a little cell phone, film them with the cell phone, then all of the sudden they would get all distorted and everything. And depending on how strong the signal was, but I mean, it was really funny. And to see that like eight years later, you guys are still here. You're still doing really strong. And Trump definitely knows who you are now. Trump definitely knows who we are now. But we appreciate that. And we did. We started on this cell phone. It was a couple of guys and Joe Sills and sat in as a apartment. If I'm not mistaken and just had a computer and a cell phone and a camera. But we eventually graduated and moved on obviously to the lot of satellite backpacks. I've got a lot of good stuff and a lot of good equipment. Yeah, I'm glad to see that. Yeah, well, you appreciate it. Where are you from? I'm sure of Miami Lakes. We live right over here. Trump, the only guy that can save this country? The only one. You'd better believe it. Yeah, he's the only one that can do it. Sure. He's feeling pretty confident about the turnout in South Florida for President. It's good. We have to hope that they're able to get this election under control that has done fairly and right. So, as long as that happens, he'll win. So, let's hope for the best. Yeah, no election discrepancies, right? Well, we appreciate your time. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thank you. God bless. There you go. All right. So, here, I'm like, I'll just talk to this gentleman. He's got a great story. He's from Venezuela. Go ahead. He was just telling me. We've got Angel over here as well. He has a story. All right. What's your name? And I know you're from Venezuela. Hey, how are you? My name is Fabian. And I'm from Venezuela. I'm born in Chicago. And I see what socialism is. And I can tell you for sure that this country is going to that in that direction if we do not stop President Biden. In Venezuela, people say, oh, don't worry. In the next election, we will have an opposition candidate that will win the elections. But that never happened. And we still have the same president. So, it's a two-de-people goal and both for Trump. Is the only man that can save this country right now? And is the only person that have the idea to save this country and help the countries that are in a very difficult situation? So, such a huge Venezuela, Nicaragua, so many of them. So, both for President Trump. And how old are you? I'm 17. And how long did you live in Venezuela? For 15 years. 15 years. And how long have you been back in the United States? Yeah, I'm back in the United States. But I can tell you that in Venezuela, the situation is horrible. We don't have electricity for four hours. We don't have food. We have to wait like 12 hours for put gas on our cars. And this country will go in there if we do not stop Joe Biden. So, did you live here in the United States under Donald Trump? No, never. But I can tell you that what I saw on the news is what I want for this country. And I'm really sure that the stories that the people say in this line are true. And that President Trump is the best president in America, cool half. And what do you think is the most dangerous thing pushing us towards a Venezuela-type government? The open borders. When you have open borders, you will have drug crisis. You will have people that will go to your homes and destroy it. People who come illegally. That's the problem here. That we are letting in so people with so much socialism for our countries. From Venezuela, from Colombia, with socialism and the idea that we ruin this country. Thank you very much. And this is your first Trump rally, I understand. My first from rally. I hope you have a fantastic time. Thank you. Have a good day. Oh, it's so good, Brian. And there was a young lady, I think. You will get a minute, just a second. I'm going to go ahead and get some business out of the way. Okay, we know that October 15th tax deadline has passed already. So don't let that stress you out. Our friends over at tax network USA want to be there to help you.

Our friends over the tax network USA. Now I know we've got some musical artists over there. Let's go over there. Let's go over here together. We'll talk to them as we're live in South Florida. And when you think of South Florida, I think of these three gentlemen right here. Of course, I got to love it. So forge out. Let's back here, South Florida. Obviously, this is Trump country, right? It's never changed. It's always been Trump country. There you go. Since 2016, we love Donald Trump. As you see, Hispanics, black love him, white love him, we love him. You love him. We all love him. Let's talk about how the culture has changed in the music industry. Obviously, you guys have a great hit that hit the charts and just went viral and almost. I see you almost every social media platform. Let's talk about how the synergy and how you guys all work together to really push the narrative from a cultural standpoint. That guess what? Trump just is not for white middle America Americans. It's from he's for everybody. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm a part of seeing our people look at certain things a different way. Lying to mislead it. So we're just trying to help the culture get back to where it needs to be. Shape it back into form. You doing it through music. Let's talk. I've talked to you about how you write music. You do it pretty quick. I'm always amazing. You'll take a new story and it meant 48 hours later. You got a music video song. Everything. So walk me through the process with you as well. How do you guys do it? I don't write. I just, you know, I haven't we find a beat. We buy a beat and let the energy from the beat just feed into me. I don't write and whatever whatever I go through in life or what I see people go through in life. That's what comes out to speaker. Let's talk about the criticism that you get not only within your own industry, but other people that say, what why are you doing this? Why are you supporting this this Donald Trump guy? What's your response to those haters out there? What's beyond is we haven't got too many bad responses from the music. It kind of seems like everybody likes it, but you know, there's a lot of haters out there. But if we just ignore all of that, we don't even respond to it, to be honest. It's really more loved and hate. So we appreciate you. Paying you to be a rat now. There's more love in hate. Let's do with the jail suit. It's viral. Where's the jail suit? A winner jail. And now he's out here being a rat. Where's the jail suit at? He ain't going to jail. Yeah, we'll wait till the next one. He's not going to jail at all. I want to see you in a Trump hat. I'll pay you more than these people pay you to support Donald Trump. I know they pay you. I'm going to be talking to you. There will be actually a question. Why are you doing this thing? Do you generally don't like Donald Trump? He's a rat. He's a rat. What makes him a rat? I just want to get the facts here, right? What makes him a rat? OK, I grew up in New York. I'm from the city of rats. I'm a little masked. I got away. But he graduated with a master's. He's a rat. He's a con artist. You're giving me blanket stuff. I want specifics. What makes him a rat? He's a con artist. You know who built his empire, the Mexicans, that he wanted to build the wall and then he didn't pay them. I'm thinking about every business around here in place. I haven't been to a business in South Florida. I didn't have his spanic worker. So you can call all those people rats as well? No. He didn't pay them. He offered them 10 cents on the dollar or else he'll declare bankruptcy or he'll have them deported. He's a con artist. OK, but what? So let's just, I'm not going to verify that story and not because I don't know. So I don't want to find it. But I will say this. House, my friends, what kind? Outside of that though, what else? I mean, do you think, let me ask you a question. If not Trump, then you're for Biden. I had to be. I'm a Republican. I had no other choice. I knew the guy. You do have a choice. When you rather elect a president, Trump, you may not like him for certain things, but at least you know your country's a better place than handing it over to Joe Biden. I respect my elders. My parents taught me how to respect my elders. Joe Biden is an old man. All right, so I respect my elders. I don't like them. I don't like them. I don't like them. I can't. Thank you, basketball. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, your heart, and today. I appreciate you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you, God bless you. This is the reason why I wanted to gauge them. As you can tell, I don't know if you can hear the conversation. There wasn't any factual stuff. It was blanking stuff. It was all but to garbage. So... He just caught in a rat trap. He just caught in a rat trap. He's in a rat trap. Hey, you got caught. Hey, you got caught in a rat trap. He got caught in a rat trap. He got caught in a rat trap. But I was telling Christina, he couldn't... He couldn't... He couldn't play for it. He basically couldn't give me any reasons why he didn't like president Trump. He's paid, right? You know what's crazy? There's only one guy out here out of 5,000 people right now, just like in Trump. They can't even afford to underbody and to pay these guys anymore. And so we know if you guys are watching this, Patrice, this is the same guy they got arrested. We're in the jail suit. You ain't got a tattoo. He's banned from the events and now he's dressed like a rat. I know his face because you know what? Real Patrice is like us, out here. We're the ones out here fighting to fight, to good fight, giving the information. This is my boy right here. You hooked it up all the time. And we love what you do. Trump Latinos, these people right here are working so hard to just grow. I'm kind of working on trying to help them out, get the stuff out here. How can they get a hold of your music right now? How can they support you? I don'ts. I don'ts. I don'ts the best way. I don'ts Spotify, YouTube, all the platforms. And when you done mega song for you? I'm all for it. When you sit down and we can, you write your own stuff. Like you guys are genius in what you do. And I come from the music industry. I can appreciate what you do. Nobody writes what you say. So you're a genius. Well, I appreciate it. And I apologize that our interview got broken up by the rat. But I think we, I think the rat. He's a rat. He's, he went on. He's a rat's out here. Well, we're living under Joe Biden administration. His rats everywhere. There's some cheese and certain spots around here. They might be good. Hard. And he still couldn't answer the questions. All right. So we're glad you're joining. So, Kristian, I want to bring in here. Most people, and I want to engage people who, for some reason, can't get behind Trump. And I want to find a legitimate reason why. And obviously that guy didn't, I'm not going to verify what he said. I have no idea. It's probably just lies. But they don't, they just dislike his personality for whatever reason. Or maybe I think he is a paid activist out here. He might be a paid activist. I mean, the fact that he wouldn't show his face, he wears the mask. He was putting the cardboard sign up in front saying a lot of accusations. I think this, and this kind of sums up the divide that I think we're having right now. He says, at least according to a sign, he says he's a Republican. He supports the Republican Party, which indicates to me, based on our current events, it's more of a religion than an actual belief in the right direction. The rep, I don't know anybody. I know very, very few people at this point in time who actually have a lot of faith in the Republican Party. I mean, the whole purpose of us being here today is to basically confront what the Republican Party is doing at the moment. So for someone to say they blindly follow the Republican Party for whatever they're doing, I think that's, it's no pun intended, a red flag that they're not doing their own analysis on the issues. And I think most Americans are disgusted with both political parties at the moment. And that's why Donald Trump has the popularity that he has is because he's the only counter to both parties. No, you're absolutely right. Now, I want to get into this when we get inside about what my issue is with the Republican Party right now and what my thoughts are on the actual pulse of the party. And the more I see the current state of the Republican Party, the more I know that the out, why he was so successful in 2016 and what he did with the swamp and all the people on the insiders. And how he blindsided both parties. I mean, he completely blindsided them because they were, they were so arrogant. Their arrogance blinded them to the fact that the American people are sick of the parties. The American people are sick of the talking points coming out. They're sick of platforms. They just want someone who comes out, says it like it is, tells you what he thinks. You can agree with what he thinks. You don't have to agree with what he thinks, but at least you know what it is. And so, you know, they demonized him saying, oh, he's got me in tweets. He's got me in tweets. But you know where he stands. You don't have, you don't have to question. You see, for this is the against this is he going to change his mind later. Is he going to do something different? No, he'll tell you what he thinks. And I think that's why he was so popular and people didn't see it coming. There you go. All right, let's go talk to some people. Good. That's what we like to do. Look at this line. I will let you walk and we'll see if we can find a few people to talk to. I just want to remind everybody as well. Go sign up for our newsletter. Go to our website rspnetwork.com slash newsletter. Super easy, super simple. rspnetwork.com slash newsletter and sign up for it. You can not only will you get special offers that are exclusive. I think I'm going to talk to this guy right here. I always look for the one person making the most noise and I'll come talk to him. Apparently, congratulations. It's you today. Well, how you doing? What's your name? Oscar. Yeah. What we can see here? We got to see it. South Florida. I am from Florida. My name is Oscar. I am 100% Republican. Yeah. What? What? Do you think a lot of South Florida, your friends, family, circle of influence? They're all Trump supporters. Conservatives, Republicans. Yes. Yes, it's cool. Yes. Yes. No, 80%. 80%. That's probably more realistic. OK. What should President Trump do on day one when he returns to the White House? What should his first priority be? The first priority is the economy and the closer border. Do you know? Because it's terrible. Do you know? Everybody close the border. Do you know what is a person easy? Do you know? Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. That's the problem. The problem is the economy. And the second is the border close and the Czech who is the person that came to our country. This is a long shot here. I can imagine you guys aren't from Alabama. Just by your accent. That was a joke. Didn't go over very well. Where are you from originally? Cuba. Cuba. We've been here in the States. 27. 27. You love this country. I love this country. You know exactly what would happen if it goes to socialism. Exactly. We know what happened in Cuba. I know what is coming to the United States. God bless you guys being out here. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Would it be the first time you've seen Trump? Yes. Yes. The first time. The first rally. You're in for a great surprise. Thank you so much. Thank you. I love it. Of course, you know, I was real curious to see exactly from their point of view what some of the biggest concerns they said the border in the economy. Yeah. There's lots of Cubans out here. I mean, not surprising itself, Florida. But it's really great to see them all coming out to support President Trump today. No shocker there that they're concerned about the border. I don't think. Especially, you know, they came here probably for our policies and our freedoms and then to see it just completely annihilated with this free-for-all in our border. I think they've got their finger on the poles, the what most Americans feel in this country. And it's great to see them out here. Yeah. Okay. Let's go ahead and walk down some more and we'll walk and talk while we're doing this. And if you just now joining us, we're live here in South Florida. How are you? We're live on there. How are you doing? I'm doing great. I'm from California. Yes. I know. You drive all over the country. You've got the great border ride. In the year. In the year. In the year. And what's your thoughts on today's turnout here in South Florida? It's amazing. The line is all the way over there. So it's exciting to see more people here coming here full support of President Trump. Yeah. We're a present Trump. We really, really need him right now, especially that what's going on in this country. And especially what's going on in Israel. I'm a great supporter of Israel. I bet the Israel seven times I just get back. Let's do live with some home and defender borders. We see these places that were the Hamas attack Israel. We've been to these places. I've been to all over Israel. I really love, really, really love Israel. Yeah. So, you know, Israel is our spiritual home as Christians and the Jewish people. So we really need Trump back. Because if Trump isn't office right now, what's going on in Israel shouldn't have happened. So Israel has been attacked. The most brutal attack since Holocaust. So, you know, and now right now they have to fight back and they have to demolish Hamas once and for all. Because the next time they'll do it, they're going to do it even worse. So yeah, we need President Trump back. Because he's the most broad Christian. Most broad Israel president we ever have. Well, I always know I'm going to get some great stuff out of you. Thank you so much. Yes, we'll see you back inside, right? All right. Christina, I'll tell you what to do. I'm sure you'll be shocked, Brian, but I was walking around talking to folks and I said, I asked this lady if she would like to do an interview. I asked her where she's from. Guess where she's from? She's from Cuba. That's right. I'm Cuban and I'm here to support President Trump. It's the only one working for weed the people. You're Cuban, but you're American. You've been here for how long you've been here? 37 years. Yeah. And I love this country. This is the greatest country. Have you always been a Trump supporter or are you a convert? No, I was brainwashed too. So that's why I'm calling everybody to open the eyes because media have been doing that to many people in Donutry Nation, brainwashing, so open the eyes and connect with God. When you do that, you're going to support Trump because Trump is on the right side. And what caused you to realize that to use your words, you were brainwashed? Well, I guess something is run here, so I had to check and I started searching information and I found out that they were working against us, Democrats. So I stopped being a Democrat and I go, I'm going to support Trump to the end. And what are you doing? And how long have you been a Trump supporter? In the 2020, thanks God. Greia is working and is happening and no matter what, we are going to wake up America. Did you come in as a means? Cuba, no. How old were you when you left Cuba? I was a teenager. I was 18. You lived? No, yes. Oh, yeah. And no. So did you vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016? No. I was not American at that time. Oh, congratulations. It was relative. God, my citizenship, like a year and a half ago. Welcome. I mean, just that welcome. But congratulations, that's fantastic. What is the number one issue for you today as far as supporting President Trump and what is it that we need to change? We need to clean everybody. I mean, we need to clean the system. The system is not working for we, the people, many corruption over there. So we had a gains that, you know, they had to work for us. We paid them. So why not working for us for we, the people? Look at the inflation. How America is declining, you know, everything. So what do you do for business? I sell the Mosa Mason bed. Fantastic. Okay. Cool. So you work hard for your money? I work hard for my money. I'm capitalized. You know, so I love capitalism. Yeah. Well, thank you so how many have you been to a Trump rally before? Oh, yeah, in all of them things. I work up the three rallies in Miami. So yeah, even all three rallies in Miami. I'm always close to him. I love him. I love him. He's the right man to do the job. He's the right commander in chief for this great nation. And we needed. Thank you so much. Have a great time with the rally. It's so fun. I love seeing these immigrants that come and love this country and can explain to those of us who grew up here. Why some of the public, the Democrat policies aren't working? I kind of feel like we need to go get a Cuban sandwich after this event here. We probably will. Hey, if I'm taking a second to talk about one of our partners for today, the wellness company, but did you know that 90% of all pharmaceuticals are made outside the US? So if we have another pandemic, we have a type of crisis, two things are going to happen. If you can find the pharmaceuticals are going to be extremely high, or they will not be on the shelves at all. That's where our friends over at the wellness company have put together a medical emergency kit. Now this stuff can treat everything from a tick bite to a rash, to a burn, to a virus, you know, antibiotics for that. Go check it out. The information for that is on your screen.

What's your name? Where are you from? My name is Marilyn and I'm from St. Augustine, Florida. Have you been to a Trump rally before? This was my first one and I am so proud to be here to support Donald J. Trump. Do you feel like you're part of history? Yes, very much so. Very much so. I will carry this down to my grandchildren and they're my great grandchildren. This is history. And what is it about President Trump that you like and support so much? He is an honest guy. He is for us, the people. He's not doing this for himself. He's doing it for us. Well, and it's interesting that you say that. He has a lot of criminal charges filed against him at the moment. They've got a civil lawsuit currently underway in New York. They've got a lot of accusations against him yet you just called him honest and said he's going through all of this for us. Why do you believe that? Keep sending him to court. He gets more popularity. He has done nothing wrong. You don't believe the charges? No, not compared with the other side is doing it. It's hardly anything. They will stop it nothing to get him. So if we could go back in time, let's go back to the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax right off 2016, 2017, the Mueller report, 2018. What did you think about at that time, what did you think about that investigation and those accusations that he had colluded with Russia? I thought it was all hoax and it was a witch hunt. You've never believed any of the, that's interesting. Is there any particular reason or you just think it's fake? I just like I say, I have followed Donald J. Trump for many years. I know his heart. I know he's innocent. So that's what I believe. All right. And what do you have a favorite policy, which a favorite policy person Trumps or what is the most important policy you want to see him take care of right away when he gets back in office? Okay. He needs to go ahead with trying to get world peace. This country is going down fast. The world is going down fast. And we need him to try to gather up all of the leaders for peaceful causes. All right. Well, thank you so much. I have a wonderful time at the rally. Such a great crowd out here, Brian. We got a lot of folks that love President Trump. They love America. They know the issues. I'm always surprised, although I shouldn't be because I agree with them, but I'm always surprised when people have always believed that the media was lying about Donald Trump. You know, I was under the impression, falsely, that back in 2018, a lot of people believed the Russia hoax. But yeah, we're out here and we're talking to folks. And from what I can tell, most people never believed it. No, they didn't believe Russia, Russia, Russia. And the perfect phone call that he had with Zelensky, all of that. No, it was all propaganda. Did you see Zelensky reached out to Donald Trump to see if he wanted to meet with him? Yeah, that's a, that's a, yeah, that was the client, obviously. And now Zelensky, and we'll talk, I'll have this on my thanks to talk about it inside, and we can still do that. But now he's asking for anyone to give him a loan, and that he'll pay you back. He'll give you credit. He's looking for credit so that he'll pay you back after the war. So you've been in sales and you've done a lot of ads and you know, you're, you're familiar with the sales world after you've received just shy of $200 billion from one country. Forget about what they're getting from the rest of the world. In one country, 150 billion or whatever we're at at this point, how do you continue to sell yourself to just give me more? Just give me more because it is a money laundering scheme and they're, they're funneling it through and we're getting the 2024 presidential campaign ramped up and the Democratic Party needs funding for that. Therefore they need their pitch band, Zelensky to go out there and give them some more money so the Democrats can funnel that back in the US for elections. Ain't, we're on to it already. Right. And just to be very clear, that that is not you or I being a crazy conspiracy theorist making accusations. There's actually bank records and there's actually checks that have been cashed and written with records from bank to bank, company to company, shell company to shell company that show that the money actually is funneled through Ukraine. It's the SARS reports, the suspicious activity reports. I know that Congress has been at the Department of Treasury. They've looked at these reports, which by the way, this is all going on even under the Trump administration this was going on. So this is not anything new on that. I do want to talk, you talk about getting, you know, electing and flipping elections and getting the right people to point. There's a gentleman up here. Let me see if I can find him real quick. Here he is. Follow me over here. He is in a district in Florida that right now has a Democrat in office right now. Remind me your first name and where you're from. My name is Rafael Arturo Ortiz and I'm from Davy, Florida. Okay. Who is your congressman right now? He's the incumbent, which is Maltz Kowitz. I call him Maltz Kowitz. And so you're wanting to primary or take him, obviously challenge him in this. Right now we're going to go in the primary August 20th of 2024. There's three Republicans, but there's only one of me. I'm running as an American go to R-A-O-T-3-FL.com. After my 22 years of service, I figured, let me come out of here. I'll retire and save this nation. We were talking about who's district this is right here. This is district 25. Okay. Right now it's Watson and Schultz. The Debbie Watson and Schultz. Watson and Schultz years ago was the DNC chairman, I think back in 2016 for that. You've got some Democrat pockets over here, but I just from walking around here and knowing the pulse of this area, this is a very heavily Republican. If not, could you say 45, 50% Republican or not more? I would say more. I would say more because after 2022 we found out that Miami-Dade is actually moving towards President Donald J. Trump. Everyone has full transparency. This should not even be a hard decision. And really, sure, and we have seven districts still unholy. Walk down here. I want to lose your spot in line. Real quickly, the cities that you live in, if someone lives in these cities and they want to get more information on you, and I'm not endorsing you. You came up to me and you said, what, what, get, name the cities that they would live in and the website they can visit you. Okay, let's start with Boca Raton, Parkland, also Carl Springs, Coconut Creek, Fort Lauderdale, Robert County, all district 23 as of the redistricting of 2022. So people have to get smart and look at the map because they changed it in 2022. We have over 800,000 constituents in district 23. That's website. R-A-O 23FL.com. Make America great again. There you go. Thank you for your time. We were talking, let's go and walk on down here a little bit more. Four. Thank you. We were talking about what it takes to flip some of these districts. Now, he had Jared Basquitz, which is a Democrat in his district. I will say that as of lately, Basquitz did sign on to the censor of to leave. So I will keep, he was just on Fox News before we came here. I'll give that to him. There were 22 Democrats that signed on to that, which I think is good. But also remember, at least until like very, very recently, a lot of the Jewish demographic were Democrats. And I think that there's a lot of Democrats in Congress, apparently at least 22 of them that have enough Jewish constituents that they feel the need to actually do the right thing and stand beside Israel because the Democrat party is not doing that. So I was really pleased to see that there were 22 Democrats in Congress that actually did that. I like that as well. All right, so, wow, this thing just keeps, this line, they just stop right here, rule. This line just keeps going and going and going. Hey, how long have you guys been out here today? So maybe I'll take a walk through. Hi, Alina. Have you guys been out here all day, all morning? Yeah, yeah, where are we from? I'm from here, to Brazil, Florida. South Florida. God bless you guys. I'm going to hold you up. The line is moving. The door is open. Go ahead. Yeah, I got you some water. It's pretty, pretty toasty out here. But there's a great crowd out here. I know there's, all right. We've got a good, a good group here. What's your name? Where are you from? Lucas, I'm right here in Florida. How long have you been in Trump's supporter? Oh, since 2016. OK, so from the beginning. Absolutely. What is it about you, and what is it about you? What is it about him that caused you to support him right out of the gate? Anti-establishment, right out the gate. That's the first thing that came to my mind, outsider. All right. Is there a specific policy that you like of his? Everything. Everything about him. What's it like here in South Florida? You know, there's a lot of Hispanic, maybe a strong minority community. What are you seeing in the community here as far as support for Donald Trump? I would say here at Miami Day, there's definitely more than a few years ago. As you know, last year, Miami Day flipped red. So you're going to see more of that as time goes by. But yeah, no, definitely stronger support. In fact, I would say there's even more supporters of his than the Santos compared to the Santos. So that's a big sign right there as well. Well, and it's interesting, because today, the Santos is going to be speaking at the debate. Do you think more people will support Donald Trump today or do you think the Santos today? Oh, more support for Trump for sure. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I see. As you see here, everyone's loyal. So, yeah, no, I think that's right. Do you think the RNC, it's time for the RNC to just get behind Donald Trump? Yes. What are these guys doing wasting their money, right? Yeah. That's exactly right. All right. Well, thank you. I hope you have a great time. All right. Oh, Brian's on. We've got a bunch of people out here. Let's go back down towards Brian. We got a rowdy crowd down here. Brian, we've got a bunch of folks. They want Trump. We need Trump. We need Trump. We need Trump. We need Trump. We need Trump. We need Trump. We need Trump. President Trump, we need you. I didn't give up on you. You didn't give up on us. And this crowd is not giving up. I'm finally in Trump. All right. Let's go through. Someone had their coffee this morning. I love that. I like that. I've seen that guy out here at all the rally. So he definitely is not. You've got Mike Lindell energy. He does have Mike Lindell speaking of Mike Lindell energy. Great setup. I want to talk about our friends over at my pillow. Mike Lindell has been faced so many problems, not only with cancel culture, but now they're going after his bank accounts. I talked to him a couple of months ago. He is having a cash flow problem. I want you guys to help him out. And you can help him out by simply going to the website. Mypilla.com slash RSPN. The discount codes is the same. RSPN for the discount code that percentages used to be up to 66% off. They've increased that to up to 80% off on that. So go to mypilla.com slash RSPN. Do Christmas shopping right now. Get it out of the way. Go support Mike Lindell. I can promise you, Christina. Thank you. We love you too. I can appreciate when the election comes back on full spring and we're hitting the campaign trail. Mike will be out here with us doing just what he's always on supporting the president. Oh, I'm sure Mike is one of the president's most loyal supporters. He goes to all of the rallies. I know he's doing a lot of work right now to secure the election. He's got his meetings every Monday night. He's very, very involved at the state and county level to make sure that our elections are secure. I am encouraged. The fact that the line is now moving, it means that the doors are open and people are starting to file into the venue, which is funny because we're not close to the doors right now. We've wandered quite a ways, at least a city block from the doors into the venue. And we still can't see the end of the line. And the line has been moving forward. I'm curious to see how far. I just want to keep walking. I mean, because we've got the top of the hour, we are going to toss to a commercial. But before then, I do want to keep walking. So do everyone a favor? Go to mypilla.com slash R. S. P. N. and support my clindale. He is simply an American patriot, and he needs your support. All right. So we're out here, high-layer, Florida, Miami area, on a Wednesday. Now, there is a GOP debate tonight. But is anybody going to watch that, though? No, they're not going to watch that. They're going to watch tonight, right here on the right side. But unpack some things. Seven o'clock, President Trump speaks at seven o'clock. The show starts. I think the speaker start around five, I think. And President Trump was very concerted and intentional with the date, time, and location of this rally here in Miami, because as we've said multiple times, it's also the R&C's debate. Also at 7 p.m., tonight here in Miami. And so everybody here knows exactly what they're choosing. President Trump was not in any way shy about his reasons for why he was having this rally today, and at the time that he had it. And so everybody here knows exactly what they're doing. And they're making a statement. They are choosing Donald Trump over the Republican Party. And as we've said, the line continues to file. We still have not yet seen the end of it. We're at least a city block from the entrance. And it's only what time is it? It's not even three o'clock. I don't know if you can see that. We'll see if you can boom it up. There's, it just goes all the way down the street. I quite honestly don't know how far it goes. They're watching us. I was watching this on the app. I see that. Very interesting. It's only three o'clock right now. President Trump doesn't speak for another four hours. It is a Wednesday. A lot of people have to work or took work off today to come see him. So I had a feeling that this was going to be a big rally. I did not expect to see this many people here this early. I did. I did. Yes. Yeah. I've passed that point I think eight months ago when it was on Monday at 10 a.m. Yeah. 10,000 people. Yeah. I now think it doesn't matter when he speaks. People are showing up. But look, but you're right. I mean, this goes down the entire city block. If not further here on it. It's way early for that. All right. Let's see if we can talk to a few people here. What's going on? Are we missing school today to come on to see President Trump? It's just okay, by the way. I'm not going to call your principal or if you're home school or you're not going to get in trouble. Are you excited? Yes. How about you? Very. Very excited. First time to see the president? No, we've seen him before. Oh, you have said, oh, wonderful. There you go. Proud to have a man. Are they with you? I'm assuming, right? Yes. We just saw President Trump in Houston and we're here to see him again, right? It's incredible. It's incredible. That was a great event at the, it was more energy oil and gas driven. Yes. We're sure. My daughter taught me more than than I knew. Amazing. What's the best thing about President Trump? What can he do on day one if he gets back and becomes president again? What should he do on day one? Make the gas prices lower. That's a solid answer right there. How about no school on Fridays? So you're just going to school money Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, no school on Friday? Yeah. Okay, I like that too. You got the kid vote. Thank you so much. What a good, good God bless you guys coming out here. She said she saw him in Houston and they had to come out here. Not long ago. That's so encouraging to see families like that. And that's one of the great things about Trump events. You'll have tens of thousands of people out here supporting the president. Family friendly. You see family, there's more families with kids and cute cowboy boots coming up here right now. And it's a happy, friendly family. Families are happy out here. We're very happy. We're in a trunk rally. All right. We love you guys. I was asking the kids and like how many people skipped school today? You guys maybe a little bit too young for that, right? No, they're both in school but we took them out early. It's okay. It's okay to do that. So as a parent myself, what is the most important issue that President Trump can address from a parental standpoint when he gets back in office? Well, I mean, it's interesting that we're talking about parental rights, right? I mean, protecting parental parents' rights to make decisions for their kids, protecting them from what's being taught in school. I mean, I think the boarder is important. There's a lot of things that are important to parents that he cares about. Yeah. How about you, Sam? I agree. Make America great. Just make them great. Yeah, he's a great husband. Are you excited? Yeah, I know. Are you excited? Yes. All right, cool. I'm going to break news here that President Trump says there's no longer school on Fridays. So you don't go to our back to school. Make it great. Just make it great. Just like that. Thank you very much. That's a great man right there. But you know what? If my kids were small like that, I think I would pull them out of school to see. This is something you've got. You want your kids to see history here. 100% and I can't stress this enough. I know a lot of our viewers have been to Trump events in their area and many of them have been to multiple Trump events. But I cannot stress. If you have not yet come to a Trump rally, you have got to go. There is nothing like it in the world. It will be in the history books as, you know, landmark events of our generation, whatever you do, find a Trump rally in your area and make sure you come out. And I think it's really important for the political process to have people come out to these rallies. They can censor us on social media. They can make it look like it's an even race. They can make it look like, you know, it's 50-50. But they can't. Let's move around here. Let's get out of the way here. I see. Yeah. We're always around. I know. I see you in every, every rally. I'm so excited. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Thank you. You guys too. Thanks for coming. Thank you very much. Yes. Oh, did you make it here? They're washing at home. They're washing at home. Oh, everybody. You know what? This is a place. I'm not afraid to be a Jew. No, you're not afraid. With this crowd. I'm not afraid to be a Jew. It's we're proud to recognize our friends in Israel. So yeah, yeah. I've been trying to change my mind. You've been trying to change. I like that. All right. Let's go ahead and show. We're Israeli-American. Yeah. All right. Thank you very much. Let's go ahead and show. We're the lines over. Well, the lines go. OK, Taylor, let's talk about our friends over the book.

Getting ready to cover the inside portion of Trump's appearance here. We'll get to this great truck that's behind me. But first I'm going to talk about ways that you can get involved with right side. Go to our website rspnetwork.com slash donate and donate what you can. We have very humble beginnings as you heard earlier from a guy that knew us when we were just doing this on a cell phone. Literally doing this on a cell phone. Now we have grown to a network sizeable audience obviously covering just about anything related to President Trump. We've only been able to do that through the generosity of a lot of our viewers. This is an opportunity for you. If you want to see us continue to grow then go to our website rspnetwork.com slash donate. You can sign up for a one time donation. It could be reoccurring. That's all up to you. Go check it out rspnetwork.com slash donate. Look at the truck behind me my goodness. Let's see if we can get a good shot of this. Now this truck if I'm not mistaken this belongs to Ford Giata Blow and obviously he's created his own little parking spot right here. But look at the paintwork on here. He just recently had it redone and it seems like now of course you got the 47 on there. It's I think better than ever. It looks really good. I have not seen anything like this for Donald Trump. I'm sorry for Joe Biden. I've seen a lot of times you'll see trucks or cars decked out with Trump swag on it. This one is remarkable unlike many others. Did you see the Ashley Babbin taking real quickly Joe come back here. Let's talk about this. This is a tribute to Ashley Babbitt. A great picture there and just a great way of remembering her. Yeah, I think it is great to remember her as well as Roseanne Boyland and the two others that also died on January 6th 2021. People walk around the backside. I wanted to just point that out. No, it's fantastic. Of course, you know, for Giata, he is the mayor of Magaville there. That's what he looked at this. That's a great, great pick there. He is the mayor of Magaville and he is known for having his cars and he likes all of this. What guy doesn't like, you know, I lift a truck with a diesel, a double pipes up top. Trump's nephew anyway. Shout out to for Giata below for really going above and beyond is when it comes to creating the thing, this truck. Look at the bottom, the fake news. It just goes to show, and this is what I love about, not just Trump rally, but Trump supporters. The whole Maga movement, the whole Save America movement. It's just people just having fun. You can be over the top, excited, proud of your beliefs. And no one's going to shame you and especially conservatives for so long we've been shamed into being quiet about our views and not talking about what we believe in because it's politically incorrect. And people go, and I don't care anymore. I'm going to paint my truck crazy. I'm going to put all kinds of cool stuff all over it. And I don't care what people think of it. And it's just a really fun, refreshing way to live in America today. Yeah. And of course, you know, this has been a commerce for a lot of people. And you take a look at the amount of merch and type of campaign stuff that's been ever created. A lot of people have small businesses. This is what they do. They literally go along this Trump campaign rally schedule. And you know, the vests are small business. The Maga movement has created jobs and businesses and lots of opportunities for people. It's fun to see. You know, you see a lot of the same vendors at these rallies. A lot of them will travel around the country. And then some of them are new. Some of them you realize they're local. They're only doing it. So it's one off with whatever the current location is today, where Miami. But you know, he's up in New Hampshire. He's up in Iowa. He's got South Dakota. He's got all the early states that he's going to be hitting frequently. And you'll see it helps the community. I mean, hotels boom when people come in and an airline travel. This movement is helping the economy in a way Joe Biden, who has control of the economy, is not helping. That is an excellent point. I would love to know the economic impact of these rallies over the course of the last four, six years, you know, really going back to 2016 and then going through 2020. And even the ones he did 38 rallies after the 2020 election, he did 38, maybe 38, 39 rallies after that. So the economic impact that he's done is incredible. And the people and the business that he's able to inspire is incredible. It really does bring the community to life, even if just for a day or two or a week, you know, while everybody's getting set up, there's a buzz. There's an excitement. There's movement. And even if people aren't necessarily buying the swag here, they're either buying swag online or they're going to the store buying red, white, and blue. You know, they're buying Trump flags, American flags, because they're excited. They're happy. It's a good feeling to see a president who we believe will make America strong again. And so it really is. I mean, it's just exciting to see what could happen again if President Trump is actually in charge of our economy. Yeah. God, could you imagine how, you know, we talked to those people earlier about what they would do on day one. And they want basically the president to fix the economy. They want them to fix the economy because they've all been, we've all been affected. And I've always said this, gas is the lowest hanging fruit, right? Price of gas affects everything. And even we had that girl that might have been eight and a hundred years old, even said lower gas prices. So the economy, I think, would be a priority. But you know what, that border, Christina, it has to be fixed. It absolutely has to be fixed. And I was really encouraged by the number of immigrants that we talked to in the line today, whether they were Cuban. We had a little bit of a break in the programming, but I was hoping to get to talk to an Israeli couple that said they're out here. They're not afraid to support President Trump. They're not afraid to, they're not afraid for their safety at these events. That's a huge statement to say in the United States of America that they say I'm not afraid to be Jewish at a Trump rally. No, that's an excellent point. And you know, and that's one of the things that, you know, President Trump and really the Republican Party in general has been a big voice for the Jewish community. And as far as to see what President Trump did by putting the US Embassy in Jerusalem, he promised to do that. And he did that. And of course, he was promised to do that. Both Bushes, Obama, Clinton, they all promised to do it, and they never did. They promised something and didn't deliver on their promises. I am shocked. I'm shocked. Yeah, no, President Trump, President Trump is the first president. He is the only and my adult life who honestly actually just delivered what he promised he would deliver. And I think that's why they, one of the reasons that the establishment hates him so much, because the establishment has this game of, oh, just say this, but then we'll do this. And just pass away the people with words and pass away the people with, you know, a couple little things here. But then we have a whole separate agenda that we're not going to tell them about. We're going to totally rearrange everything. President Trump didn't do any of that. What you, what you heard him say is exactly what you got. They shined a spotlight on the discrepancy between a politician. I hate to call President Trump that. President Trump, if you're listening, I'm sorry. But a politician who did what he said he was going to do, and it was very plain and simple, verse, politicians that play the game. And it was so black and white that, I mean, he just exposed everybody. He exposed the system. He exposed the game. He exposed the rigging of, not just the elections, but the rigging of the system to benefit the political class. And I mean, he exposed everything. That's why, you know, and like I said, when we get inside, which might be a little bit sooner than later, because the line, I'm amazed at how quickly they've moved, the doors opened here at two. So just a little over an hour, they were able to process thousands of people, which is props to the security team here and the, the efficiency of the Trump team of getting everyone through here. So we may actually go inside sooner than we had planned. But in any event, President Trump exposed all of that. And that is one of the reasons why there's so many Republicans. And I'll give you a great example. You've got Republican chip Roy from Texas is endorsed. He's endorsed Ron DeSantis. There's plenty of things that he is standing for that don't necessarily reflect the basis stance on those topics. But he is one of many Republicans that I just can't figure out that they've seen what they're so disconnected. Because if I was to go to some of these people's constituents in their district and do some polling there about what they support, what's important to them, you might find out that what they're standing for in Washington is not necessarily what people stand for back in their home districts. I think that's true. I mean, to call chip Roy out on this, I'm just using him as an example. Because if I was to go to his district, I can guarantee you. I know his district. I'm from Texas. I know his district. They are polling very hard for President Trump. And I know that for a fact. I think that's right. I think there is a discrepancy between some of the members of Congress and their constituents, particularly as it relates not just to Donald Trump, but Donald Trump's view and perspective and the way he wants to lead this country. That also said, I also think the right side viewers are shall I say more intuned and more involved politically, the fact that you watched the Trump rallies and you watch all of these events and you see what's going on. I do think it's in the process of happening, but I do think a lot of Americans really were just kind of asleep at the wheel and didn't appreciate what was happening and they're now getting caught up on the issues. And so issues that they believed were simple like, yeah, of course America supports Israel. Why is that? Why are we even questioning that? Now they're going, wait a second. We don't and you know, you and I were probably several of the right side viewers are not surprised by the fact that several members of Congress actually pro-Palestine who wants to wipe Israel off the face of the map and they're okay with that. That's not surprising because we've been involved in it and we've seen it. But I do think that there's a lot of Americans that are surprised by the severity and the stark discrepancies between where we have stood as a nation and where we're standing today. And I'll go further just recently we heard that Ken Buck, representative Ken Buck announced that he will not seek reelection. Now that is due to part of his stance on several issues that kind of got a lot of negative feedback from his own district. So I think he got a wake up call that he was on the wrong side of a lot of issues and that he was probably going to risk chance of even being primary. So why even go through that? So he just announces that he's no longer going to run for reelection. And you're going to see I think I personally think this is the sad part about it. I think you're going to see many more but I don't think they even wait till the election. I think they just retire. I think they drop out which minimizes our majority in the House. I think that might be right. I thought Ken Buck is an interesting one because yes I think he has missed the mega mark on several of the issues but he did. I think he did support Austin Kevin McCarthy. Did he not? Was he not one of them? Which struck me as I was a drastic maneuver which I fully supported from the beginning. It was such a drastic maneuver that I was surprised that someone who had not stood necessarily closely with the mega crowd that he went ahead and did that. And that's just one topic that's kind of separated the field. There's several others. One is you know protect children's innocence act which is something that is trying to make it a federal crime to have gender affirming care done on minors. That would be any one under the age of 18. Of course you'd be surprised Christina how many Republicans are against that. They think it's a states rights. And so you can argue this and say well is child abuse a state's right. Could you beat a child in Louisiana but you can't beat that child in Oklahoma. That is a federal situation there. And I think that a lot of these Republicans are too weak and spineless to basically come out on a topic that is so controversial. No I think that's exactly right. I think Republicans are learning to find their spine. Some are finding it sooner than others. Can I show this real fast? I've got someone here who brought my stuff. Well I think this is a great talk. Yeah. Hey, we'll get to that. Once you talk to him, I'll get to him in just a second. I would do one talk about a friend's over at the Birch Gold Group. Now is at the time there's so much turmoil in the world right now that you need to protect your investments. And these guys are the experts, gold, silver and precious metals. Text the words Trump right now. To 98, 98, 98 with the Birch Gold Group. And they'll send you a free information kit and they will let you decide. But if you have a traditional IRA, they'll show you how to do a gold back IRA. There's even a special offer right now for a free gold bar. Please text the word Trump to 98, 98, 98, that is the Birch Gold Group. All right, it's starting to camera that way. And show that the line, they process a lot of people. And Christina, I think you've got somebody that you want to talk to. Oh, here, you want to do an interview? Are you available? All right, here. Those lips. Probably. That's really funny. Cindy and Don from Wisconsin, right? And how many Trump rallies have you been to? Two. Two, okay, so this is your second. Oh, fantastic. What brought you all the way from Wisconsin to Miami? We have a place in Florida and we're coming down here. And when we heard about it in North Carolina, we changed our route. And I'm so glad that you could be here today. And I appreciate it. If I could just show folks I hadn't mentioned, they had my books. So this is really a fun moment for me because I got to sign my book here for them. Stealing your vote, the inside story, the 2020 election, what it means for 2024, you can get it wherever books are sold. What are you looking forward to Don most in seeing President Trump today? I heard there's a lot of a bunch of speakers who are going to give him and his endorsement that they have not here to for given him. So I want to see who's here and who's on the Trump Train. Fantastic. And I'm sure you're all aware that we've got the RNC debate also here in Miami. I see you rolling your eyes. What brought you here rather than going or watching the RNC debate? You've got to be kidding, right? They should, I mean this is ridiculous. They're wasting all this time and money. And they should be here, spawning Trump. Come on, come on already. And there's a fourth one scheduled in Alabama. Here, come on. What do you think about the RNC? Well, actually I should ask you this way. What do you think about President Trump scheduling this rally for the same day time and basically place as the RNC debate tonight? Well, what I'm really disappointed in is that the, none of the Republican candidates have really delivered a full-throated defense of President Trump in defense of the law fair. Vivek has been the closest, but you know, Dessanas is hanging his head on his entire hopes on that Trump is not even going to be able to run. So it is extremely disappointing to me. And isn't it interesting Donald Trump is on trial here in Florida? Last I checked, Rhonda Santis was the governor of Florida. I mean, I know it's a state and federal issue. They're separate, but certainly you would think that the governor may take a stand on trials that are occurring in his state. No, exactly. It's the law fair and, you know, he's been indicted at 91 counts or whatever. As the president says, the real president says he wears it as badge of honor and this is we need to fight the weaponization of our government. Fantastic. Thank you guys so much for stopping by and I hope you have a wonderful time at the rally. As always, we've got more folks over here. Everyone loves Brian. Brian's so easy to spot. We've got folks taking photos and getting ready to see President Trump speak tonight. The doors have been open for about a little over an hour. You can also see us on Rumble. Please check out our Rumble stream. We've got our life. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, my gosh, this is so cool. Are they on my Instagram at Kelly Jules. I mean Kelly dot Jules. How do you spell Kelly? K E L L Y and that's on Instagram. Yeah. Check her out. You can get cool Trump bracelets. All right. Oh, you've got a whole bunch of them. Yeah. How are you guys? I'm sure how are you related? Um, okay, so this is a good girl dad right here. If I can just say this, you got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Girl that. All right. That's awesome. That's awesome. Okay, so the book is great. Okay, I'll get my number. We have given her my phone number real quick. We're changing, we're exchanging contact. No, I don't want to do that on there. But just gives you an idea. This is, you know, the families, the people of parents that have come out here with kids, I think it's great right now. And I think that's exactly what the Trump movement and the policies is all about. It's all about families about strengthening the families, getting back and putting school choice in the hands of the parents. And also it's, you know, ironically there's going to be a couple of things that the president will say, likely tonight that we get the most applause. A lot of them is taking down the Department of Education and fixing this woke curriculum that is happening not only across our public schools, really, but across the country and our university system. And we have really seen that become amplified with the Israeli, Palestinian, Hamas conflict that we have in the Middle East. We've seen these universities have become a place where the students feel like, you know, their freedom of speech is violent. We're talking about what's important to families. And one of them is, you know, the educational system. But let's talk about what's going on right now on college campuses with the, these kids. I'd say they're really misguided kids at this point that are out there disrupting. I think they're brainwashed for the most part. Let's talk about that. Well, I think we can now see a concerted effort on the part of the establishment to really use our higher education programs to indoctrinate kids who become adults and they become, you know, good little slaves, basically. Basically think a certain way. Become employees, work for a living, allow the establishment to tell you what jobs you can have and where you can go. And there's this political class that selects people to be in these particular elite opportunities, like politics, like government, you have to come in certain places. And that's, that is not the American way. It's not the way the United States was designed. And it's not the best way for America to thrive. Not just America, any country, every country needs diversity of all kinds, of thought, of not just of appearance, of background, of educational background. And they're trying to force it through this educational program that everyone starts thinking the same way in that dangerous. Yeah, it is dangerous. And I looked, I think back at times when I was in college and you yourself, I would have never seen this type of support for a terrorist organization on my college campus. I would have never imagined Christina that you'd have kids ripping down posters of missing Israeli children. Amazing. I would never thought that that would be applauded and accept it in our society. It is shocking. Not just because they're missing Israeli children. They shouldn't be doing it for Palestinian children either. You shouldn't be doing it for anybody. Anybody who is currently being held hostage or as a victim of a terrorist organization, you should not support the death of the victims. On either side, it's evil. And it's just shocking to see that it's okay and people will post about it online how proud they are of the fact that they tore these posters down. I mean, it's shocking how proud the left is to be so hateful, especially when they say, oh, where the party of love, peace and tolerance. Last Saturday, there was a major march in Washington, DC and they literally took buses of people from South Florida and all across the country and put them in DC. I watched it online. There was a YouTube channel that streamed this all. It was a very professional production. So they had all the plan in place for that. I couldn't believe when they would pan the crowd and show who was there. It was mostly, yes, there was Palestinians there, being people from the Middle East, Egypt, and all countries, really. But there were so many young, I'm going to say this, white girls from the suburb with the headscarfs on and they would be in the interview. And they were clearly from the suburban of North Virginia. But for some reason, this is the cause that they have to fall in love with right now to give them some type of meaning to be fighting for something. They're just on the wrong side of truth right now. I know. It's embarrassing to me that I actually fit this demographic. But college educated or higher women that come from, at least middle class families, tend to be the worst offenders of just insanity, woke ideology that makes exactly zero sense. Okay. Educated, affluent, and bored. There's three things they got to. You're not bored. No, you're not a bored. You're not bored. You're always busy. But my point being is that is who gets caught up in these type of movements. Let's go back to what it looked like with the Black Lives Matter movement of summer's ago. It was the same thing. That was a kiss from the suburb got sucked into this social movement that people felt like they had to be a part of. And we all know how that movement faded out and was basically discovered that it was a, I'm going to say money laundering, but it was very fraudulent with the way they dealt with their money. And so this is the next one though. This is the next one. You're right. And they create this cycle because the best way to feel good about yourself and to feel like you're contributing to society according to this woke ideology is to support victims. You have to have a victim somewhere whose cause you're championing and if you're doing that, then you're a great human. God forbid you actually live in a prosperous society where everybody's actually thriving and growing and doing well and you don't have to rally behind victims. But so they perpetuate victimhood because it's what makes them feel good. And so even where there is no victim, they'll create victims. Because it makes them feel good about themselves. And then in order to create victims, you have to have an aggressor, you have to have the villain. And so who better for the villain to be than white men or you know, some picks some demographic that's actually fine and turn them into villains. And then you can create this perpetual victimhood. And then you got, you get to constantly feel superior to people. There you go. Man, we are giving away all of our stuff that we had plan to talk about inside. But what if you're on the mark though? Okay, in about eight minutes we're going to transition inside. It would take a commercial break at the bottom of the hour and then we'll try to, let's get where the sun's can flaring in the camera. But you're so right on that. It's all about finding a victim, right? And having an oppressor and then constantly going after the oppressor and making that a campaign. And you know, we've seen it happen after a 2020 election or when, well, whenever President Trump was for reelection in 2020, it became him. He was, he was, he was now the monster. He was the man that was creating all this chaos. And and to a certain extent, that is his game plan. That's their game plan now. But they now have broadened that to just white men, middle America. Well, that's sticking. It's not working for Trump. And so they have to make it bigger, they have to make it worse. They can't just shame Donald Trump. They have to shame everybody who follows him. They have to shame or threaten, you know, white conservative men or you know, anybody who isn't filled with hate, their, their message isn't getting out. And on the topic of messaging, if I could just say, I don't know if we could say, we've got a lot of folks. I've seen probably more than some of the other rallies. We have a lot of like independent journalists here. There's a few cameras here. And I see it. Who's got another, another crew right over here that's doing independent journalism? I think one of the things, one of the things that I love about all of these independent journalists is that mainstream media is losing, right? It used to be that if you wanted to tune in to somebody, you would tune into Fox News, MSNBC, you tune into these big corporations and listen to corporate news. But we have so many other networks out here. People have more options out, including right side, including RSBN, which you can find on Rumble. Check us out on Rumble. Don't forget our Rumble channel. But I'm just really encouraged to see all of these different networks because to me, it shows that it's decentralizing the media. And I think that's so important right now because the media was so influential in brainwashing everybody and pushing this narrative that decentralizing media and having many different venues where people can get their information, I think is a really important recent development. Yeah, because let's just, I've recently discovered that many people out here, including the man in the rat uniform, Muscady has college degree from the University of Tiktok because that's where they're getting all this misinformation from about Trump and about conservatives and about the America first movement. Who would ever think that a MAGA, the word MAGA, which means make America great again, would be considered some type of extremist talking points for someone running for a democratic seat somewhere, being in Virginia and listening to all of the news and all the stuff in the DC area, all the local political ads, they always labeled their opponent. We've got to defeat this MAGA extremist. I always thought that was really funny because I thought, well, when did it become so extreme to make America great? And it doesn't mean taking it back to some type of point in history where it's like this white wash of everyone. And that's what they painted it to. That's how they remember they originally did that. They said, oh, an ultra MAGA. An ultra MAGA. So they've used it as talking points, Christina. So I don't know what the next phase of attacks will be because every time the left tries to label us as like ultra MAGA, we come out with T-shirts, you know, and all this other stuff. And we lean into it because we do feel like this MAGA movement is open for everybody. It's about making America great again. Everyone's contributing to this country and whatever capacity. They're not hiding their agenda anymore is what's going on before they would hide the fact that they were trying to demonize their political opponents and criminalize political opposition. They're not doing that anymore. By labeling us MAGA extremists and domestic terrorists and targeting parents and Catholics, God forbid. They're outing themselves in the fact that that's exactly what they were trying to criminalize their political opposition. They are actively working to criminalize their political opposition. And but for this movement, but for Donald Trump, but for the thousands of people that have come out to say, not on my watch, they would have already done it. They would have already shut us up and said, if you say this or if you support second amendment rights, our constitutional rights, you're going to be labeled an extremist and you're going to jail. But it really is Donald Trump and his movement, this MAGA movement, that it's not about Trump. Obviously he's the leader of it. It's about making America great again, but it's so much bigger than Donald Trump. And I just think they can't stop it. They just can't stop it. OK, we're going to wrap here in about a minute and go inside and continue our coverage inside Christina Bob Brangling live outside here in high alia, the gates open here at 2 p.m. So they've already processed thousands of people. And if you've noticed, it's been a continuous flow of people coming through the security gates. If you want to just maybe pan over, you can say, it's been a continuous flow of people. So if you live in the area and you think you're going to come out here and standing a long line, you're going to get right in. But now there's a lot of people inside. Don't get me wrong. But you're going to get in rather quickly. We want to make sure you share this broadcast, make sure comment, tag a friend. Yes, it is on a Wednesday. And you know what, stream this at your desk at work. It's OK. The boss is not going to yell at you. It's allowed. And it's only 330 right now. So just reminding everybody that the massive crowd we've already seen go inside. And I have not yet been inside the venue, so I don't know about how much it holds. But it's not even 5 o'clock yet. And so there's a lot of people that haven't even come off work. There's going to be a lot more people that show up. If you're in the Miami area, come out. There's plenty of room for you. The line is not very long right now. And they're letting folks in. So there's lots of space coming to see President Trump speak is like nothing you've seen before. If you've already been out, you know what it's like. Please, please come join us. It's so important. Because even though they might censor us on social media and they might try to look like we don't have as many followers or people aren't retweeting or posting. They might actually be. They cannot lie about the number of people that come out here. When we physically show up to these rallies, they can't lie about that. And so it's so important. And so I'm so grateful for everybody in all of these communities that come out to these rallies when they're in your area and show support. Because this is our collective voice. It is our collective voice. There's tens of thousands of people here to support Donald Trump because we support America. We want to make America a great again. And we can't do it without you. So please, if you're in the area, get out here. That's a steady stream of people coming in here. All right, we're going to take a break.

And I said this is probably the fastest I think I've ever seen them process thousands of people. So props to the security team here in Florida for this rally as we've got. So let me show you some step aside. We've got thousands of people in here on the ground. Of course, there are some bleachers around here. They have got it. I guess sectioned off probably in about the 35 yard line. Let's just give it that going towards the end zone with with chairs and people thousands of chairs on the interior and of course, the bleachers up top. So what a great day here. And if you so far missed any of the coverage up until now, we encourage you to go back on our rumble channel. Scroll back after this broadcast and absolutely check that out. Christina Bob now joining me will step back in here. I was trying to duck and I ducked and then didn't realize the camera had hand and I popped my dog in up right in front of the camera. That's okay. Sorry, buddy. Anyway, here we are live inside. Yep. Let's talk about the setup real quickly. I said we're positioned on the 35 yard line going towards the end zone. This is big for a route. Like, I mean, this is a big venue. It's a big set up. It's a very good set up. It's a very good set up. This is a much bigger venue than I would say. I don't know what we haven't done football stadiums before. I know. It's fantastic. It's fantastic. So, yeah, temperature wise. It's hot. I've had three people so far come up to me and say, I don't see how you have this. Take your coat off. I may take my coat off here in this second. It's 85 in sunny, but it will cool down to a great comfortable. Seven six. It's time. By the time the president goes on, but we're glad you're joining us and let us know if there's anything in particular that you would like for us to cover during these rallies. Now, we were kind of going over before the show of some of the topics that we were looking at. And a lot of its dichotomy, a lot of its what's happening in Congress right now. Yeah. The border, the Middle East crisis, the crisis on our college campuses right now with all of this activism that's taking place. Yeah. But let us know. Go ahead and drop it in the comments section on the rumble page and then we will go up on there and read that as well. And please go to rumble. The feed will cut, I think at six or six thirty somewhere in there. The feed from YouTube is going to cut. So if you want to watch the show uninterrupted, please switch to rumble. Yeah, it's very important that you do that. But we're glad that you're joining us today. And let's kind of recap some of the things that we saw outside. We talked to dozens of people. And one of the things they really emphasized is that the need for President Trump to be back in office for the economy. Never fill in the effects of bynomics. Yeah, absolutely. And I think a lot of people recognize that Donald Trump actually wants America to prosper. And by America, he doesn't just mean the country. He means the people who live here, the Americans. He wants Americans to prosper. And I think comparing Donald Trump and his four years in office to Joe Biden and what we had before Donald Trump, I think Americans can go, oh, our government wasn't actually working to our benefit. And they can understand it in a way where we may not have been able to understand if President Trump hadn't been in office for those four years. Right. Imagine where we could have grown it. I mean, people's investments. And I just saw a stat the other day that the mortgage rates under President Trump were around 3.75, 4% at the highest, I guess, whenever he left. Because it did go up as he was going out of office. And so, it was slightly to now, or 8%, even higher on certain types of mortgage rates. So it's doubled. So we'll put that in perspective on, it's going to cost you twice as much for the same house you would have had back in 2016 and 2019 under President Trump. And I live in Florida. I live here in Florida. And they did a, you know, a reassessment on my own house. And taxes and insurance went up. And so even my payments are going up here in Florida, run by run to San Francisco. Yeah, well, one of the biggest things in Florida, and I'm sure our four other viewers would appreciate this or under a relate to this rather, right? Is the insurance that you have, you have an insurance crisis in the state. It is expensive here. Very expensive. But what can be done to fix that though? That's the part where I'm confused. I don't really. What can anybody in a political office do to lower the insurance premiums for homeowners in Florida? I don't know. I mean, I really don't know. I don't know. I say I don't know, not because I don't know that there's a solution. There's obviously, there's always going to be a solution. I've never worked in the industry. So I don't, that's not my area of expertise. So I don't know. But I do believe that there is a solution to it. And I do think that just good leadership and management of the state and the industry is, is pretty significant. I think the insurance industry in and of itself has a lot of problems. Not, we're talking about housing insurance. And in Florida, we have a lot of natural disasters. So unfortunately, there's just a lot of different types of insurance that you need here, whether it's wind and hurricane and all of this stuff. However, there's medical insurance that I think is a whole other racket that needs to be rained in. Oh, my goodness. Is it not? We are having a conversation the other day. Table that idea. And we're talking about our friends over at the wellness company. What a good segue into this. When you look at what we just came off of with COVID and the pandemic, there is no telling what is right around the corner. And Dr. Peter McCall has developed a medical emergency kit that is designed to help you and your family get through some of the most toughest, difficult times that you could ever imagine. I'm talking to everything from literally a maybe a tick bite, you know, a snake bite, something like that. Kind of minor thing up until to get into virus. And this medical emergency kit has Ivermectin, has stuff that you need to treat several viruses. So go check it out there. The information is on your screen, the emergency medical kit. And when we were talking about health insurance, I would want to make sure that I had everything in my power that if something was to happen again and look, all this stuff popping off around the world, it's only a matter of time before we have some type of terrorist attack on American soil. So I want to make sure that I have this stuff. Go check it out. The information for that is on your screen. Get that emergency medical kit. But let's talk about health insurance. That has also gone up under the bionomics, umbrella. Yeah, it seems to be a way, I mean, it seems to be a way to force people to pay more for nothing. I mean, I've been in situations where I've gone to receive particular health care treatment that could or could not be covered by insurance. And they say it's cheaper if you don't use your insurance. Well, then why do I have insurance? But you have to have insurance because we're required to have insurance. You get penalized and all that stuff, or not following certain regulations. But a lot of procedures that you go to get, particularly if they're more elective procedures, are cheaper if you don't have insurance. I saw a video on Instagram of this guy that was talking about this very subject and said, look, I'm a doctor, the most frequently medication that seniors come in and get was this. I can't remember the name of it. If someone comes in with their insurance card, I have to take their insurance card. I can't tell them by law, oh, wait, don't use your insurance. I can actually get it for you cheaper. He goes to cost on that drug with $3. He charges six for someone who doesn't have insurance. But if you come in and say, well, I've got my insurance card, their copay may be 20 bucks. They don't know that they're actually paying more three times more for that medication by going through insurance rather than just paying directly. Because of state law or federal laws, they cannot tell the patient not to use their insurance card. It's such a scam. But that is part of the thing that makes President Trump so enticing is you take a guy that knows, hey, how you doing? Good to see you. Good to see you. Love that. We always stop and say how to people. If you take a business person to look at these problems and address it from that standpoint rather than a lobbyist or a career politician, that's the difference between President Trump and the rest of the field. Yeah, President Trump, and he says, I have common sense. And he will help joke about it. He might even do it tonight. But he'll joke. It's common sense. People say I'm ultra conservative or I'm super conservative. He goes, no, it's common sense. It's just what is the right thing to do for people in this situation? And it seems that common sense is struggling at the moment. It's fighting for its life. Okay. There is a GOP debate going on tonight. And we can talk a little bit about what you could see there. If you were to watch that, we know you're not going to watch it because you're watching us right here. On rubber. Okay, so here's my problem with what's going on right now. And I know that some of you might disagree with me out there. And please let me know the chance to be due. This, this, so far, the polls are so lopsided right now with President Trump leading by 40-50 points. Yeah, depending on which one you look at. He already won. Okay, he's already won for the most part. I do understand that the others that are in the race, and you're going to ask this question, why are they still in this race, Christina Bob? Because they are hoping that the swamps successfully removed Donald Trump. Okay. That's what they want. That's what they want. Okay, so all of them. Chris Christie thinks, because I do spend time listening to him when he goes on CNN, because that's the only place that will take him. That's why you're in charge. Yeah, you can do things like that. Thank you. Thank you. We love you too. We love you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so what I'm going to say is he is the only one that's really taking on Trump head on. The other candidates aren't really- Wait, Chris Christie is the only one that is a- that's his whole strategy. Like it's- for instance, Nikki Haley doesn't necessarily attack Trump head on. Okay. Neither does the Vic Rombuswamy, neither does Tim Scott. They may refer to him, but they don't make it- they're primary attack-talking point. That's all Chris Christie does. Chris Christie is the only one stupid enough to do that. Okay, I would agree with you on that as well. So there is a debate tonight, but I think you're going to find less time- some of those other candidates, they really think that if Trump was to be removed from the equation here, they all think they have a realistic shot of again, that nomination. So- Well, they might get the nomination- interesting word choice there. You said they think they have a realistic chance of getting the nomination. Correct. They'll never win. They will never win. I agree with you. I agree with you. But I do think that- and I don't think at this point they're- they're- they're positioning for a vice president pick or the cabinet because I think that- That way- that- That- That bridge was burned a long time ago, right? It blew up a long time ago. So their only strategy now is desperately to cling on to whatever political power that is behind them to prevent President Trump from going back to the White House. Which is the swamp, right? The swamp is behind all of them. The swamp is funding their meager little campaigns. The swamp is hoping that Joe Biden and Jack Smith and Merritt Garland and all of these nasty folks can take Donald Trump down through these legal challenges. They will not be able to successfully do that. That's not actually in the realm of possibility. Okay, so what should- okay, and this brings it to a bigger topic here. What should the Republican Party, the- the Republican National- The- the R&C, right? Yes. Should they say right now, okay guys, this thing is decided. Let's stop spending tens of millions of dollars on attack ads against Trump and then get- On the base, on events. You can go on through here. You can sneak through. I don't know if you'll get through. Yeah, okay. Okay. As- I was warned that this media riser is extremely- It's so tight. It's so tight. So some are saying that the R&C should really suspend this primary debate season, right? Yes. And get behind their presumptive leader in the Republican Party and then put their resources in- Into securing the elections. Yes, and into- Securing the election. Basic elections happening around the country right now that we need to win. There was a few last night that we did not win. Yeah. And people were pointing fingers going well. If we were more focused on winning some of these other Republican matchups, rather than just taking out President Trump from the other people running in the primary, we would have won those elections. We are fractured. We are not focused right now. Well, I was talking to some of my friends in Pennsylvania just trying to get their take on what happened yesterday because Republicans got crushed in Pennsylvania yesterday. Like it wasn't even close. And I asked them, I said, you know, what happened? What was it? Was it the issues? It was like a stellar candidate. You know, what was happening in Pennsylvania? And they said the base just did not turn out. They just didn't turn out to vote. And I'm not blaming the base because there's a reason they didn't turn out. They didn't turn out because no one inspired them to vote. But you know who inspires people to vote and to show up and to fight hard? Donald Trump. He inspires people in the midst of crazy odds in the midst of a ton of obstacles. They all go vote for him. Whether it's by mail, whether it's in person on election day, people are inspired and encouraged and excited to vote for Donald Trump. And apparently there was no one in Pennsylvania, not a single Republican in Pennsylvania that I'm aware of. At least not in any of the statewide offices or any of the court who inspired the base to turn out for them. So that is what the RNC needs to be working on. All right, great. Pause that thought. We'll get back to that. Over at the tax network USA. Now that October 15 deadline has passed. It's over. So for whatever reason, if you weren't able to file or you're scared to file, perhaps you owe taxes from a year or two, five years, ten years ago, don't panic. Let these guys do the work for you. They will help you really get a better tax settlement through this negotiation process. The website is taxnetworkusa.com. There's a phone number on the screen as well. You can hit that phone number. But get the tax relief that you need. It doesn't matter if you owe $10,000. Well, if you owe a dollar in taxes, pay it. There's no excuse not to pay that. But if you have $10,000 tax bill or a million dollar tax bill, let these guys help you out. The tax network USA, the website, taxnetworkusa.com and let them get to work for you. Don't be scared and live it inside the tax USA, the website, and phone numbers on your screen. Okay. So, going back to the Republican. Okay. So, last night, I was watching Virginia. And I know that Governor Duncan was saying, look, we need to hold the house and flip the Senate. We're able to do that. A many, many say that the donors, the big donors, would push him as a dark horse into this 2024 presidential election. Well, that didn't happen. It didn't happen. I don't think the same thing we were just talking about Pennsylvania. I don't think Glen Youngkin moves conservatives to go vote for him. Not only do I think he's uninspiring and particularly vanilla when it comes to conservatism. Right. He's seen as one who used President Trump, took President Trump's assistance to get into that governor's race. No matter what he's saying, he never would have won that race if President Trump hadn't stepped out and said, hey, mega voters, get out and vote. They weren't going to turn out for him. And so he pushed that. He fueled that. He put his foot on the throttle right at the last minute and it worked. And that's why Youngkin won. They're not going to do that. Clearly, they didn't do that for him again. And he certainly, you know, it is lining with Trump. That's how disconnected then. That there are certain people in Washington think that for whatever reason, a dark horse like Youngkin can enter the race at this point and then make people go, oh, yeah, you know what? I think I'll shift my vote over to them. That's the problem in this country. They're delusional. They're absolutely delusional. Many people in the Republican Party that are delusional on what the actuality, what the reality is. Yeah. The significance of a Trump endorsement and the significance of getting help from Donald Trump. It's really fascinating. We see it. Whether it's Glenn Youngkin, Ron, the Santa, I mean, you name it. We can name a dozen other politicians that needed Donald Trump to get them into office. And then it's funny. It's funny. They're like, oh, you know, give me a boost. Give me a boost. The president Trump gives them a boost. They get into office and then they feel like this mega star thinking, oh, I'm such a big deal. I'm so great. You are writing his co-tails. All of your momentum, every, every, every bump that you got, every piece of momentum that you got was Donald Trump's that he let you borrow. To think that you can recreate that on your own is absolutely delusional. I think it's emblematic of what's happening across the Republican Party. And the Republicans, like, I think Matt Gates is a good example of this. He's clearly, he clearly supports Donald Trump. And he doesn't stray from his own values. He went out and he fueled the McCarthy, basically, recolor removal of McCarthy. And people told him he was crazy. They said it's the worst thing you can ever do as career suicide. And he did it. But he straight, he did it. Staying true to his constituents, staying true to what he believed his constituents wanted. And in the face of great obstacles, he gave us a great speaker that actually is going to do really great, great things for the conservative movement. So I think Matt Gates is a good example. Marjorie Taylor Green is a good example of people who can stay individuals, keep their own individual identity, do their own thing, but still recognize that they're writing President Trump's co-tails. Yeah, that's true. And staying true to their constituents. Yeah. Earlier, that if some of these, some of the Republican party that take this hard stance that goes very much against what the base stands for, if you and I were to do a rally and to some town hall in their districts and ask their constituents, say, I've got to list the questions here that your representative voted on. Let's go ahead and put the vote to the floor. They would be shocked. And I think that this, I think what you're going to see this primary with people taking these stances, like Kim Reynolds, is a great example of that. It's a great indicator of who is on board. The Kim Reynolds thing is just shocking. How surprised were you when you saw that? Very. I wasn't surprised that she would secretly support DeSantis because she's always kind of been like that. But to see it announced that she was actually thinking of coming out to endorse Ron DeSantis was just baffling to me. And again, the only way that I think it can be justified, and I don't know, I've never talked to her. I didn't interview her. I don't know what she's thinking, but the only thing I think that could potentially justify Kim Reynolds, the governor of Iowa, by the way, potentially coming out to endorse Ron DeSantis is because she too wants this swamp to win. This is it. And these are people who are, I use the term raised, but I mean raised in their career, right? They're raised in this political system. They feel that they've earned a place. They've earned, it's their turn to have power. And they don't like the fact that Donald Trump can effectively say, hey, I like this guy over here. And suddenly he's, you know, the governor of a state. They don't like that. And so they want to limit Donald Trump's power. I think there's really selfish animosity inside a lot of these people, and they're all being exposed for it. But what's interesting is you and I have been to Iowa more times than I can even imagine. I've learned some of Iowa. We love you, Iowa. But here's what, every time we go to Iowa, those events are swamped. They are packed with Trump supporters. And everywhere you go, it seems like there's Trump signs everywhere. The people very much support Trump. So which makes it really interesting. Because Kim Reynolds, I think, was a popular governor. I mean, some people say she's one of the most popular governor in the country. Yeah, and she spoke at Trump. I mean, we've been to Iowa events before where she was speaking. So was this yet another desperate attempt by the swamp to say, look, we've got to start peeling some people off that can help us, you know, maybe I really think it's people who are looking at the current landscape of legal challenges, whether it's criminal, whether it's the civil litigation in New York with Latisha James, whether it's he's having to fight to remain on the ballots in Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, all these other states. And they're looking at that going, I don't know if he's going to pull through. I'm going to go some other direction. They're cowards. They don't have fight in them and they're not willing to stand up for it. To be clear in the legal front, President Trump is prevailing on this. He is absolutely prevailing on this. He's going to be on the ballot. That's not going to be an issue. Regardless, and this is actually a good point to make now because the ruling in that case in Colorado has not come out yet. I think it's expected to be out before Thanksgiving. We know that that's a leftist activist judge who funds groups that try to get Republican out of office. So, regardless of the ruling, whether she rolls for, gets President Trump, if it needs to be appealed, whether it's at the Colorado state level or eventually goes up to the Supreme Court, which I would actually expect the Supreme Court to take this, there's absolutely no way that any negative ruling in that will withstand scrutiny at the Supreme Court. I think we can get it there pretty quickly. Several other states have already looked at the issue. I actually do expect positive rulings in some of the other states. One, I believe, has already indicated they're not even going to consider it. Don't even bother trying. It's unconstitutional. It's an unconstitutional challenge. So, for those that are concerned about whether President Trump is going to be on the ballot in all 50 states, he's going to be on the ballot in all 50 states. Democrats are making it hard, but you have to wonder, why are they trying so hard to get them off the ballot? If he's just a crazy, fringe guy, why wouldn't you say, yeah, put him on the ballot. Let's see how you do. Yeah. Let's talk about also yesterday, or they before yesterday, they had some voting machine discrepancies in Pennsylvania. They did. I want to say it was the Western, I can't remember where. It was one of the smaller, I think it was one of the smaller communities. Okay. Let's walk me through that. Let's be real careful what we say here, because I don't want to end up in some- This was coming from CBS Philadelphia reporting, and this was the reports that I saw coming out of Philadelphia, and they were quoting the election officials that were running the polling locations. So, you can find it, I posted it on X and Instagram, I just put out the CBS report. So, Gayway Pundin had it as well. Yeah, Gay Pundin had it as well. So, a lot of media outlets reported on this. Yeah, and so what was happening was, and this was for judicial retention, at least what was reported was that the race where they were having discrepancies with the machines was on a judicial tension race, meaning the candidates were not running against each other. The question was, should this judge be allowed to remain in office, yes or no? And so, it wasn't like it was favoring one candidate over the other. The answers were just wrong. So, if somebody voted that a yes vote on one candidate and a no vote on another candidate, they would switch, or there was some type of glitch where the machine would not properly record that count. However, the interesting part is, it would properly record it on the paper ballot. So, when the paper ballot would print out, the voter didn't know that their vote was improperly recorded. And so, credit, I give credit to the election workers, they actually flagged it for people, and said, hey, we need to make sure that your vote actually counted correctly, we're having problems with this. So, there was a glitch there from the reports. I did not speak with anybody directly in Pennsylvania who was present at one of those locations, but I looked at many media reports. Oftentimes the media may pacify us on issues like this. So, I did not see anything that indicated, you know, any, it changed the outcome of any election. But, there was, I mean, that's a serious problem. And we, I'm going to pause that and we'll talk more on that. But I do want to take a moment to talk about our friends over at the Birch Gold Group with so much global uncertainty right now. No one need to have bricks. You also have this push for this digital currency. And I just saw a news article this morning about putting microchips and people's hands, and would you be willing to, you know, for experimental purposes, have a microchip installed in your hand to do the digital currency. I say, heck no, our friends at Birch Gold say, heck no. Go check it out. Go text the word Trump to 9898, 9898 to get this free information gold kit. Now what they want to help you do is convert a traditional IRA into a gold backed IRA and they can do that and they can also save you a ton of money. No money out of pocket to do that. So go check it out at the Birch Gold Group. So where's Trump to 9898 and also with qualifying purchase, you could get a free gold bar. I like the F word on this commercial here free. You got to love free. Go check it out the Birch Gold Group. Okay, to your point. So that is probably one of the top discussions that you have amongst people is like, well, Trump wins this election with a presumptive nominee and he goes head to head with Biden, which is by the way in the polls. We'll talk about the polls here in just a second. If you assume that the election is secure and we've done enough in these states to make sure that we're not dumping thousands and thousands of ballots at 2 a.m. in the morning, we're assuming we're not doing these mass mail-in ballots that are from dead people and lots and you've got a book about it. If we can secure the election, he's got the support of the American people according to the polling. According to the polling, President Trump is doing very, very well. Yes, he's got all the swing states if the election is secure. Which, that's a really good point that you make because the only way the election is going to be secure is if people get involved to be a part of the solution. We need poll workers, challengers, observers, volunteers, judges. Every part of this election, we need people on the ground working. It's going to get secured from the bottom up, not the top down. We've all been hoping for a top down solution that has not come. So please, please, please get involved. Michael and Dahl has put a great network together of all of the different election organizations across the country that are doing this type of work. So whatever county or in in the country, Michael and Dahl can point you to one of the groups there that's doing the work. You can go to causeofAmerica.org, that's causseofAmerica.org. And say, hey, I live in somewhere in Oklahoma or I live in Kansas or wherever. And they will connect you with the groups in your area that are doing the work that we need to secure our elections. Yeah, because you see the latest polls of the swing states. Pretty amazing. I mean, the only one that was within a margin of error was Wisconsin. Right, right. Wisconsin, supposedly he was down to Pennsylvania. I think it was Pennsylvania. I'll have to double check. But I think he was up like 10 points in Pennsylvania, which is what intrigued me so much about the election yesterday is they did not conservatives did not show up. They just did not show up to vote in Pennsylvania yesterday. And I'm not blaming the voters. There wasn't anybody for them to feel that they needed to get out to do that. So it's interesting to me that when they pull for Donald Trump, he's winning by such a large margin. But yet when there's an election that he's not on the ticket, nobody shows up. Yeah, that's interesting. What was on the ballot in the state of Ohio? We're talking about this for a little bit. It wasn't abortion. It was basically a state amendment, maybe I got to get the verbiage on that. They also legalize, they vote to legalize marijuana, recreation marijuana, which I think is very interesting because we look at the two, what would seem to be a liberal policy about abortion, about wanting to have the right, you know, a woman's right to abortion. And marijuana, those are two, talking, there's a two points that the left really leans in hard on. Yeah, yeah, pro choice and then marijuana. Well, and I think that goes to what we're saying. Conservatives didn't show up. They're, you know, they put issues on that are very left leaning issues and conservatives don't care about anything on the ballot, so they don't show up to vote. That's what I mean, that is a tactic of the left. Put these initiatives on elections that conservatives don't care about. Yeah, 406 here, local time here in Kissimmee, Florida, Brian Glenn, Christina Bob, providing a non-stop action going up to the opening. Now they have a program of SARS-CIT-5. Yes, we're going to get some good speakers, I five of them. We've got some great speakers. And then of course, President Trump speaks at seven o'clock. I know that Marilago is what, about an hour and a half south north of here. About an hour, yeah. About an hour north of here, so to imagine, hopefully his commute here is easy and quick. I think he can get here on time. Hopefully, hopefully he can get here on time. Yeah, I know there's a lot of folks here looking forward to it. I think this is just a really cool venue. We're in the middle of the football field. And you've got grass on either side where folks are getting their food. We've got food trucks and carts right over here to the left. People are coming out of like a picnic. They're partying and waiting to hear from their speakers. Well, let's step aside. We'll show you what it looks like inside here as we are about a 55 minutes away from showing the program. And this is one of these unique rallies where we're in a very heavily Hispanic area, South Florida, obviously. Right. President Trump is polling very well. More than he did back in 2020 in the Hispanic market, in the African American market. And I think that a lot of people resonate, and especially in the Hispanic communities, to these family tradition, these values, and pushing back on the gender, you know, the dysphoria, if you will. They're not buying it, and they know that President Trump won't buy it either. I think that's exactly right. We saw a lot of kids here with their parents. You interviewed some of them out front, but parental rights is a really big issue right now that I think parents, not only are parents concerned about, but they're concerned that they need to be concerned about it. That's the topic that they never really had to push before because who would have thought that somebody else should be in charge of your own children? It doesn't really make any sense. Well, and you said this earlier, Glenn Junkin ran on that premise of protecting kids and schools. Now, whether or not he did enough, but when he's up for re-election, we'll let the voters determine on that because a lot of people, when you said this, they'll ride the coattails of a Trump, maybe not endorsement of being like Trump, like him, and they don't necessarily get too close to him, but they get close enough to pull in his supporters. But at the end of the day, it's the way you vote, the way you govern. It's going to pull the, it's going to let them know for sure that you have earned their vote. And quite frankly, some of these are public and that we can go into Congress here in a second. I don't think they've done that. I think Congress has been a major let down for the American people. This is where I'm going to go with this. Let's see if we can come back. We'll step back on. This follows up on what you said earlier about. They didn't show up. They didn't show up. I personally feel like there is a lack of leadership right now. I know we just got a new speaker. So I'm going to give him, I'm going to give him, I know I'm going to give him a hot minute, right? I'm going to give Johnson a hot minute. I do like Johnson. I do like him. But let me tell you what needs to happen because we are losing the support of a lot of people that from the base. They want consequences. They want action. They want accountability for what's happened. They want to know that this government has been weaponized against President Trump. They want to know that Mallorca is in his reckless border policies that he continually will tell you that the border is secure. Yet we've had all-time record number of Godaways and even the ones that will be caught, okay? Record numbers. But still says the border is secure. He has not, why have we impeached Mallorcas? I have no idea. Why is Christopher Ray, but great, the district attorney and DC? We're Republicans, voters, you and I, you and I, you bought home. We need accountability. We want action. We're tired of strongly written worded letters. We're tired of the five minute floor speeches on Congress that go viral. Have we had strongly written letters? I'm Jordan. I'm Jordan. I'm Jordan. I'm a Jim Jordan fan, but dad gummit. You know, every time we get on something, we write a strongly written letter. We get on social media. We make a video. We take a five minute floor speech. We do a one minute floor speech. We put it up. It goes viral. And then we walk away. We're going to do something next time. We're going to do something. And then we walk away. We don't ever follow through with action. Republican voters want action. And right now, they're not getting it from anybody. And that is the, we're, I'm telling you right now, I feel like the girl in the airplane that went viral. I'm telling you right now, we are going to lose the majority before the election. Because we've got people that are going to retire. They got people that are, I'm telling you, they're going to drop out. People that know for a fact that they're not going to win the election, they may just walk away. We can, our majority could go down to one person. Because that happens, we are done. The Democrats already own us. All it takes is a couple of people now to have the Democrats get their way on bills on the floor. But the American people are angry. I'm angry. They're, these people are angry right now. Because there's no accountability for anything that's happening in our country. Nothing. It's beyond me that Bayorkas is still sitting in that chair of a director of Homeland Security. I am blown away for that. I mean, I understand your outrage, but are you really blown away? I mean, our Congress has done nothing for decades other than cow toe to crazy liberals. They want to fundamentally change our country. So, I'm not surprised. Right, okay. So yes, I understand the outrage. I agree with the outrage. But at the same time, the Republican Party had become a party of coward. And they were, they were, I say, were in a metamorphosis at the moment. The party where they would go along to get along, they learned that if they didn't really challenge Democrats and just let Democrats do whatever they wanted, they could keep their seat. And it wasn't very hard. Yes. They didn't have to work out. You're speaking the truth right now. It's though, they said, let's just go along to get along. We get to keep our seat and everything is fine. And that is the generation of politicians that are in Congress today. We have a few breakout stars. The Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor, Green. And I'm out, Jim Jordan. I don't want to bang on him earlier. He is the best of the best of the best. But the American people want action now. Yeah. That's why Kevin McCarthy was removed. So largely. And I would agree with you. In my opinion, and Jamie Commer is going to excellent job too on all of the Biden crime family. He has done a phenomenal job. And it takes time to put all of these talking points together so you can have action with a subpoena, which I think is coming with Hunter Biden and James Biden real quick. All right. We're going to get into that real quickly. Let's talk about the tax network. If you were literally behind on your taxes, let's say that you hadn't paid taxes in one year, two year, three year, five years, do not panic, do not have anxiety. Our friends want to help you. Okay. They can do it. Simply reach out to them. The website is on your screen. You've got a phone number you can call as well. And take care of your tax bill. There is no excuse not to do it. No help you save money, save your tax bill and relieve stress. Go check it out right now. The information for that is on your screen. I know that deadline just passed of October 15th, but now time to move on and take care of the problem. Go check it out and get take your taxes taken. Take care of your taxes. Okay. I personally feel that Kevin McCarthy would still be your speaker if you would have came out first of the year and sit and hammered home the Biden. 100%. Put an impeachment vote on the floor. Make people in Congress step up, step up and put their name down whether or not they support or not. He didn't do that. He didn't do that. He didn't do that. He didn't do the same single subject spending bills and the American people are tired of these big omnibus bills where they're sending billions and billions of dollars for stuff they don't want to get one little concession for something that they do want. And so Kevin McCarthy promised he would do that and he didn't and now he's out and he's a disgrace. He's the only speaker that's ever been removed. I mean, that should be a lesson. It should be a lesson. Let me ask you a question. Okay. I want you to give me your feedback on this. Do you think that we should hold the same standards to Mike to Johnson, Speaker Johnson as we do with Kevin McCarthy? Yes. Okay. I agree. I do. But there's people out there right now that want to pull some of it. They want to pull the red line over a certain direction. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're going to draw a hard red line. If you're going to hold somebody accountable for not doing something, then you need to hold Speaker Johnson accountable for the same thing. I agree. I'm going to pull it like, yeah, because I'm with you on that. But I'm not married to Johnson. Like, when I say married, I mean, I see a lot of people. I don't care who the speaker is. I just want to speaker in there who's actually going to do what they want. Like, like, my biggest thing is I want to count. It all goes down to accountability. That's it. And if you're not willing to hold people accountable for stuff that has gone wrong and breaking the law, I mean, it's up that it absolutely has been horrible for this country, which is the open border, then we need to rethink our priorities. And so do your question. No, I'm not surprised, right? And you asked me on this surprise. Yeah. But I'm just like everybody at home right now. I'm angry. Everyone's angry. I want accountability. I want change. I want, I want, I want the Republican Party to change and learn how to do it. How to fight. We don't fight. Democrats know how to fight. They bend together and fight on everything. They're locked. They're locked in step on every topping. We're not. We're not. But I like where we are better than Democrats in the sense that the Democrat Party has taken over. Democrat Americans don't have a voice anymore. If you're a liberal American, there's nowhere. When I say this, if you're a liberal, sane American who actually loves this country and wants to see it thrive, but you happen to have liberal political views, there is no party for you anymore. Other than mega, you're welcome here. You're welcome to join us. Right point. Well, but I, many of them I would say probably don't necessarily identify with the mega movement. But you are welcome. And you're welcome to come here and people will listen to your views and you can have, you can have that dialogue. The difference is they don't have a place in their own party where they can go. No, they don't. The Democrats of 20, 30 years ago are by far not the same Democrats as we have today. I mean, I go up in the gallery there on the House floor and I can. They kicked out a Kennedy. I mean, day of case, you and your can't even run as a Democrat because they're pushing him out. Like, who would have thought the American Democrat Party would be pushing out a Kennedy? But it's interesting that if you look at the face of the Democratic Party, which in my opinion, what the media focuses on is this squad. What is this very leftist progressive as you can get face of the Democratic Party, which I think it does them an injustice because I think there's more old school Democrats that love this country. They want to keep all of the tradition of this country of honoring the flag and all and the gender, you know, knowing that the guy created a man and woman only. There's not, you know, limitless genders. They still, they believe that, but they have been hijacked. Why these by these radical even the gay movement has been hijacked. I mean, the gay movement have been hijacked. Like all of it, all of it's been hijacked. The, the, quote unquote, normal Democrats have all been hijacked. So if I could go back to the election, you know, I still get on that soap box. Maricopa County, I saw reports and I saw something from Gateway Pundit actually reporting that you'll be, you'll be shocked to hear this. Maricopa County messed up their elections at several polling locations. This time it was only 17% of the polling locations that wasn't a 66% from 2022. And what had happened was the, there were a handful of polling locations and I still need to dig on to where they were and what the demographic was in those neighborhoods. But a handful of the polling locations, approximately 17%, closed at 430, right? I don't know. I don't know why, but it was planned ahead of time. The polls were going to close at 430. The polls statewide didn't close until seven. And when the announcements went out about polling and polling locations, it said that statewide, they were going to be open till seven. When people got their ballots, when they got their notifications that lived in these areas where they were actually closing at 430, the ballots and the flyers that were mailed to them said the polls opened until seven. So if you go on election day, you have until seven o'clock. However, it closed at 430. And you could have gone to Stephen Richards website and it had the correct times on it, on the website. But if you went by what was mailed to you, you were misinformed about the time. And there were a lot of people complaining. Same day, like election voters tend to be Republican, tends to be conservatives that go in person, either drop off their ballot or vote in person. And so it was just a little bit of a cluster yesterday. Now, I don't believe there were actually people on the ballot, in particularly in Maricopa County, I think they were ballot initiatives, funding, they were, yeah, they were options of like, what are we going to fund? Are we going to fund this new highway? Are we going to fund this up? So it wasn't people that were on the ballot. But I would still be upset that I was misinformed. Maricopa County, how many times do you have to screw up an election? And if the amazing had there, let the stone for the sake of this discussion. And if you're not completing competence, right? There was nothing malicious that's incompetent. How many incompetent elections does Maricopa County get to run before they all lose their jobs? Well, and what type of preparation are they going to have for 2024? Because when you said that, the first thing I thought of was, well, who's the printer? Who, who okayed that flyer? Who, you know, was just done intentionally? I mean, I don't know. Maybe it was done intentionally. Maybe it wasn't. Yeah. These are some of the things that we need to kind of talk about. We're going to shift over a little bit. These are the things that I think we all want to make sure that we address before the election. I don't want us having this conversation. Christina, days after the 2024 election. Sure. Oh, why did that paper not fit that printer box? Oh, why was the wrong date put on there? Oh, why was this polling center closed? These are the things that I don't want to discuss. I want to discuss them now, not after election. In fairness, Brian, we've only had three elections in the last three years in Arizona at a less four years in Arizona to try to figure out whether there's problems. You know, give us time. That's what the leadership in Maricopa County is banking on right now in competence, and that people will just chalk it up to, oh, it was a simple mistake. It was a printing error. It was a whatever. It didn't affect anybody. It didn't affect how many times it would be hard. It doesn't affect the outcome of the election. Oh, just a few people. It was only 17%. Only 17% of the polling locations. Not a big deal at all. Of course, it makes our castor get us a big deal. But even if it didn't actually, let's assume it didn't change the outcome of any of these ballot initiatives that were on the ballot. If it didn't change the outcome, what it does is it makes the people of Arizona lose confidence in their leadership, and they feel helpless, and they feel like they don't have a voice. And they feel like their vote doesn't matter. Their vote doesn't count. Whether that's true or not, we don't know. I don't know what the purpose for all of this was or how this all came about. But the leadership in Arizona, and I will start with, in competent Katie Hobbs, the leadership in Arizona, Adrian Fontez, the Secretary of State, Scott Jarrett, the election director, Stephen Richard, the Maricopa County Recorder, every single one of them, oh, the people of Arizona, a clean, fair, honest, transparent, competent election where there really truly aren't major discrepancies, where they don't have to post on Twitter and say, oh, sorry, we totally screwed it up, but don't worry, it didn't change the outcome of the election. That's not okay anymore. You have to run an election where people can be confident that the result is accurate. Okay, let's talk about Arizona Senate. You got Kerry Lake that's in the race. It is kind of a crowded race if it's not right now. Let's break that down. There's a couple of races that are crowded with Magda people. Okay. CD8 is as well. That's where A-Pomadev, Lake Masters, and Anthony Kern are also all running for that district. Because you had Debbie Lesco. No longer in the district. Debbie Lesco is district. That's going to be an interesting race because you've got Sherp Mark Lam. Yeah, the Senate as well. Get your thoughts on how that plays out and how much money has to be spent in that race to get that, assuming that Trump and yours, Kerry Lake would become our next senator from Arizona. What does that take? Well, of course, I'm with Kerry Lake. Kerry Lake has been so good for President Trump. President Trump has endorsed her. I'm with you on that. Yes, all the way with Kerry Lake. It's unfortunate that she has to spend the money in the primary, but she does. I think that race is particularly contentious, though, because it's one that we can take back. Kirsten Sinema is currently sitting in that seat. She was the Democrat who became an independent. I suspect she became an independent largely because she wanted to keep her seat, and she could tell the Arizona was trending red. I don't know. That's just my suspicion, because why else would a Democrat leave the party? She usually votes Democrat every once in a while. She gets credit as being a moderate because she doesn't vote completely insane, but she's not a moderate. I mean, they're like, hey, should we generally meet a light kid? She goes, no, people are like, look, she's a moderate. No, she's not. She's Democrat. She's a liberal. I mean, she colored her hair like purple or green or whatever. She's out there on the spectrum of hair colors, for sure. That race is going to be really, really expensive to put it that way, because it is a seat that we can flip to take back. Now, and let's talk about the Senate real quickly. And I know that for those that I know we all went through civics, we all know, but we've had a political science class. But the Senate has so much power. People need to understand that. And I feel like in the Senate, we don't necessarily have that fire brand in there that can help push stuff. We've got Ms. McConnell. Oh, okay. Well, that's all we need right at this point. What do you mean we don't have a fire brand? Yeah. Well, it's, it's, so that's why I think it's, would be such a great addition to put Carrie like in the Senate. Yeah. I do think that she is that fire brand that would completely get the Senate. I mean, they have so much power. Yeah. We think of, they can, they, all these nominations, kind of what, what Coach Tuckerville's doing right now. Yeah. And we're literally going through and blocking all of these nominations that go into the, confirmation that go into the military. We could easily just voted them all in and it's done, but he's going, he's, at least trying to slow things up a little bit. Yeah. We need, we need more fire brands in the Senate. I think that's right. We need younger people in the Senate. I mean, I was joking, obviously, about Ms. McConnell. Well, I mean, we, we, we, we, okay, look, look at some of the, well, look at, look at fine-starring. I mean, look at some of the people. We voted on the day she died. You literally had to pry power out of her cold, dead hand. Right. Right. And she literally just, I had a step aside, she'll the crowd real quick as we are live here. I, I lay a Florida program starts here at around. We got about 30 minutes, I think, before the program is set to start. Yeah. Which is nice. We're going to go down a little bit here. Starting to sundown here. I mean, sun sets around five, you can walk about 535 here. So the sun is going to come down and you know what? People like you said earlier, people are going to get off work and be able to, you know, once again, come out here. You said this before. You've got tons of space here. I mean, you've got a massive football stadium. The infield here is pretty full at this point. Yeah, it's pretty full. People in the bleachers, this is going to be great. Yep, they will put people in the bleachers. It's not even yet five o'clock. So I suspect we will have another wave once people start getting off work and start coming down. If you are in the Miami area, please come out, support President Trump. It's great. It's starting to cool off. I don't know if you're feeling cooler. I just thought the cool breeze is not 81, not 84. That's a little bit better. But it's a great event thus far. There's lots of great vendors. There's a lot of really great people out here. We're going to hear from some really good speakers as well. It is filling in, but I'd like to reiterate, if you're in the Miami area, please come out because the more people we have here, the more we prove to the left that the majority is with Donald Trump. Joe Biden cannot replicate this. He can't even come close to replicating this. So the more talk about it, has any political figure been able to? Replicate this. I mean, I can't imagine, for instance, I cannot name another Republican outside of Ronald Reagan that had the people so charged up to get involved and get out to the polls. I mean, President Trump just was a, he took a shotgun to the political system and just absolutely blew holes through all through it. And we got to see exactly how corrupt they are. And I don't think anybody has ever done that in political history. No, President Trump is, oh, I can't say it once in a lifetime. I mean, he's once in a nation's history. President, he's done things that have never been done in American political history. The people love him and that's why the establishment is afraid of him because the people do love Donald Trump and the people do support Donald Trump. And the political establishment are scared of the people and the power that the people have and it's represented by Donald Trump. Yeah, I agree. They are absolutely scared of what's happening right now. Thank you. A lot of people walking by. All right, let's go ahead and talk about Biden and the abandonment of the donors from the Democrats getting behind Joe Biden. I said this a couple years ago. I feel like, let's step back out. I feel like the tide will turn and Joe Biden will not be the nominee. And I think that the polling is indicating that that is the place. Well, it's got to happen quickly because they've got deadlines to get it. Oh, this is interesting. Do you think they're going to pull us switch your rule and figure out some of the legal chicana to somehow subvert the legal process for getting somebody on the ballot? How are they going to do it? Well, they own the system. They can do whatever they want. Interesting. Which is sad about this. But I do think that the donors are starting to question Joe Biden. And age aside, because I don't think sometimes age is a factor because, by the way, President Trump would be the oldest president to be reelected for a second term. But the difference between Joe Biden and President Trump might so be 100 years because the physical ability, the mental capacity, the things that President Trump does on a daily basis is far more than what President Biden would ever do. I can't keep up with that. I can't keep up with that. I can't keep up with them. Because everywhere he goes, we go. And I still can't keep up with them. No, but even just like at Marlago, or just like he's constantly talking to people and, you know, going from meeting to meeting on the golf course and lunch and breakfast and he has so many people constantly around him. I can't keep up with him. Yeah. And so basically, I think you're going to start to see personally a shift because once more polling comes out and they're going to see that it is almost, the economy is not going to get better overnight. He hasn't made any policy changes to improve that. I think the crisis in the Middle East gets worse. I think oil disruption gets, becomes a part of it because right now there has not been a disruption in the distribution of oil so far. There has not been. That won't last long. So once you start to see that, you start to see gas prices go back up. I think the Democrats are going to be desperate and it's going to be kind of a hell marry to get someone in there. Stop with the Michelle Obama's talk. That's just, that is deep web internet. That's Q conspiracy about your crap. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. But what is going to happen? I'm going to be closely tied to Jibiden. Well, absolutely. But think about this. Where did Gavin Newsom go two weeks ago? Where did he go? Where did he go? He went to China. That's what I thought. He went to China. Now, with Joe Biden going to China, it says a couple things that he is trying to not only make some relationships there. Yeah. But also try to position himself politically for fundraising, for financing, for campaigns, for his— Fundraising from China? Hey, you can go for well. They have very creative ways of doing that. It's not direct. You can sell paintings. You can sell paintings. I've heard that's a very good way to buy something. Very limited to painting. But I do see a change. I really do, because they— Of course. Joe Biden can't do it. And they can't lose his election. They cannot lose his election. They'll do anything to not lose it. If even if it means ditching Biden to the side and putting somebody else on. I think that's exactly right. I completely agree with you. I'm curious to you thoughts about how they're going to pull this picture out, because as you know, the ballot access period opened—I think it was in November, right? To actually put your name on the ballot. We saw President Trump go to, was it New Hampshire? You went? Yeah. Yeah. We saw President Trump actually go in person to get his name on the ballot in New Hampshire. That's going on now. That closes. Is that closing January? I don't know what I'm supposed to say. I'll have to look that up. But it closes. It doesn't stay open forever. You have a period of time that you have to get your name on the ballot. And when that closes, it closes. And so if you think that there is another way, once that time is over for them to get someone else on the ballot, I'm curious about that. Yeah, it's going to be an interesting couple of months. It's going to be an interesting couple of months. And then even that's the Democrat side. Now, if you look at the Republican side, obviously President Trump has a commandingly in the primary, but don't think that the only reason why these other guys are staying in there is because they think through the little thing that they're going to do. And the only reason why these other guys are staying in there is because they think through the legal process and you know more than anybody here, that's the only, that's the hell marry for them is the legal system. They have so many hell marries right now. They've got like half a dozen court cases, criminal civil and civil, multiple civil cases. They've got, of course, the media hounding him. They've got the typical lies that they've been doing all of these investigations. They're trying to get them off the ballot. They have, they're doing so much to try to destroy Donald Trump because they're scared of him, but more than him, more than him, they're scared of us. They're scared of the American people and that's what Donald Trump represents. He says it fast when he says they're not after me, they're after you, I'm just in the way. There you go. All right, let's take a moment and talk about our friends over at the wellness company now. Did you know that 90% of our pharmaceutical companies are actually located outside the United States. So if we were to go through another pandemic, what would we do? What would the pharmaceutical shelves look like? They either be completely wiped out or those prices could be 10 to 20 times the normal price because of the shortage. Our friends at the wellness company have an emergency medical kit that is right for any certain outbreak of viruses, snake bites, tick bites, anything. I've remected it in there. Dr. Peter McCall have had Zavell at this emergency medical kit just for that. You could one in your car, put one home, put one at the office. The information is on your screen. Go check it out. The emergency medical kit. What a fantastic way to make sure your family stays safe and as always put that promo code in there because you will get a discount on that. The medical emergency kit. Go get it today. Because I'm telling you, that's something else that often comes into my mind about what's going to happen. Is there going to be another outbreak that disrupts the normal election procedures that all of a sudden we have to, I don't know, mel in a ballot or all of a sudden we have to, I don't know, just vote from home. Whatever crazy thing to come up with, it's actually very scary because we're in desperate times and I don't have to tell you that. Our viewers know this as well. Very desperate times. I don't doubt that they are going to try to throw a wrench in things. I think they're going to push this court case in New York. I think they're going to push the news about January 6th and all the other cases through the end of the year. And I think they're really going to crank it up at the beginning of next year. So buckle up. Just know ahead of time that it's coming. It's fine. President Trump will endure through whatever they throw at him the way that he always has. And just rest assured that their legal challenges are legally insufficient. They are insufficient. They will not withstand. So I fully expect President Trump to have no problems getting reelected as long as we all do our part to secure the elections. Please, please, please get involved in an organization in your local area. You go to causeofamerica.org to figure out who in your area is doing what? Get involved and we'll see President Trump back in office in 2025. It's really interesting though that I think a lot of young people, especially that are on these college campuses right now with the free Palestine and ripping down postures of kidnapped kids and some believe them. But that tells you where their mindset is at. And when they come, you know, assuming they're legal of age of 18, they can vote. Like, where's their mind at as far as the future of this country? Like they're going to be lined up. They're going to line up for hours of vote for Joe Biden, whoever the progressive nominee is. And I think that's a very scary moment to think about the same people that are coddling terrorists are trying to tell you who the next president should be in our country. Yeah. I mean, it's crazy to me. It is crazy. I think I don't think they have the American majority. We've seen this with the polling numbers. President Trump is leading substantially, even in all of the swing states with Wisconsin being within the margin of error. So President Trump has the lead. I think what the left really is trying to do is secure their victory through cheating, whether it's cheating in the election, whether it's these legal maneuvers that they're trying to do to take them out, they're not running a clean election. They're playing games. They're messing with, they're using the judicial system as a weapon against the American public. So I think that all of the actions that they're taking against Donald Trump, I think it lends to the fact that they themselves know they don't have the American public and that they don't not only do they not have the support of the American public, but they don't even know that they can rig it enough. That's the way that I see what they're doing. That's the way I see how this plays out. All right, with 20 minutes before the top of the hour at 5 o'clock, we'll be taking a commercial time out to come back here. And what I understand, this program does start at 5 now. We'll see if that goes off on time. Hopefully it does here. We've got thousands of people that are still coming in. I mean, behind the media riser, I still see them coming in. So this place will be full. I want to give a shout out right now to our moderators. I did this a couple of weeks ago, and I hope they heard that. I hope they appreciate it. We've got a team of moderators that have been with Rice side from day one on various platforms to make sure that the people in the chat rooms are not getting out of control. And of course, we're all for free speech. We don't mind people posting viewpoints that different than maybe we're talking about right now, but they do keep out the ones that are just being completely outrageously vulgar. They do monitor that. Thank you, moderators. So thank you, monitors for all you do. It's funny. So we can stand in here in front of this. In front of here, and we've been doing this for coming up on three hours straight with pretty much zero break. But they have been doing that as well back in the studio. They have been working. They do that into the very end. So we want to thank you to all of our moderators for definitely coming in here and making it happen. And making the conversation happen and making it flow and safe and fun for everybody. Don't forget a little after 6.30. The YouTube channel is going to cut out. Please make sure you go to Rumble.

Grace Saldana, Eddard and Chief does a fantastic job of making sure that the article is the news that breaks. I tried to, you know, I'll send her a news topic and show it back. Oh, my team's already on it. Great. So she's on the ball there and I'm just really happy to have her on the team. So go sign up for that newsletter as well. As things, I mean, this is a very pivotal time in our country. And of course, we've got the presidential race, but you've got the stuff going on in Congress. We've talked about the impeachment. I'd like to know and comment down below who should be the next person to be in peace. I think obviously a Joe Biden would be number one. But I would go with my orcus, but drop your things in the comments. We'll talk about that. We'll talk about how realistic that is because our Republican Party is not prepared to do shit at this point. That's the truth. And these people need to know that. We have a fractured conference. We have a group of people that absolutely won't get on the same page to do what's right for the American people. And if it seems like I'm angry, I am angry. And you should be too, because we've got two years in the majority in Congress and nothing has happened. I say one year, I mean, one from January. But going through next year, assuming that we don't lose anybody from retirement or they decided to drop out, you should be angry. And that's where we all need to step up and put pressure on our elected officials to do what's right. Like their phones up, call their offices, send them emails, tag them on social media. You have to do that. That's the only way that we're going to be able to make it work. The power of the MAGA movement is the power of the people. It's because of the massive following that Donald Trump has and how collective we are. We show up in groups. We show up in big numbers. We have big results. That is the power of this movement. And it's great to tweet and it's great to put stuff out on social media, continue to do that. But we need people showing up at events. We need people showing up to work elections. We need people showing up. Whatever issue it is that matters to you, show up, get involved, find a group to get involved in because our power is in our numbers. And make sure that if your representative is on social media, ranting about a particular topic or it seems like they're taking a stance on something that you believe in, make sure their vote follows that up because what's happening a lot of time is their messaging will be one thing. Their vote will be the other because in the end of the day, if it's not a recorded vote, you don't know how your guy voted because it just gets lumped into a knower, a nay or a yay. I was shocked. You probably know that's better than I do. But I was shocked to see the secret ballot, the difference between the secret ballot and the recorded ballot for the speaker. They were so different. And to me, it was so disappointing. I don't even remember who it was for against the revenue. So disappointing that members of Congress who are accountable to the people were embarrassed to cast votes the way that their constituents wanted the vote. This is interesting. This is a true story and a lot of people have not heard this. And I'm not going to say the name of this individual because I'm just going to withhold that. There are people on some of these sensitive votes that will wait and wait and wait until someone else votes against it or for it. Look at their social media to see what their reaction is and then vote and avoidance of being absolutely lit up on social media. Instead of voting for what they think is right and what their constituents want, they're avoiding backlash on social media. And the thing that's so disgusting about that is if you're conservative, you're going to get lambasted on social media. I mean, it doesn't matter who you are, not because the American public doesn't support you, but it's because the left controls media. It's correct. I mean, except X may be kind of sort of an exception because I do think Elon Musk has tried to censor it again, but it's still controlled. Like everybody that works there and everyone that monitors like controls it, it's still run by crazy Marxist. So the fact that you're letting them dictate how to vote is so stupid. When people will change their vote, they'll vote a certain way, go back to the office, all of a sudden their comms person says, wait a minute, we're getting lit up for that vote. So what do they do? Go back and you can change your vote after there's a certain time limit, you can change your vote after it's over. Who are they getting lit up by? Their constituents. Okay, but that's good. Yes. Then you need to go change your votes. If it's the constituents, change your vote and do what your constituents want. It's so easy. Look, if I ever decide to run for politics, this is so easy. Find out what the people want in your district. Find out what the overwhelming policies that they want in place. What do they care about? And hopefully you identify within your heart and your mind and your soul as far as you believe in it. And then do it. Okay, just do it. If it fails in DC, it fails. But at least you stood up for your constituents. That's the whole point. That's the whole point. That's the whole point. That's the whole point. That's the whole point. That's the whole point. There's a smattering of people all over the country and you need to vote the way that your demographic, your constituents, your group, your congressional district, sorry. The way your congressional district wants you to vote, that's why we have 435 members of Congress that we get a sampling and then we can figure out the direction the country needs to go. It's really easy. It's so simple. I'm getting frustrated talking about that. You should be frustrated and I apologize for saying a customer earlier, but that's where I'm at right now because I feel like we have completely wasted 10 months, 11 months of any type of control in the house to get anything done. Yeah, we had a few small victories, but I want big stuff. I want impeachments. I want my orcans and the board of clothes. I want Hunter Biden sitting in an oversight meeting. I want him subpoenaed. I want James Biden subpoenaed. I want impeachment articles on Joe Biden. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. I've heard it. As soon as another strongly worded letter is written, it's coming. Before I record the next social media post, it's coming. Before I can get on C-SPAN and do my five minute speech, it's coming. That's what people are tired of hearing. They've been coming for weeks. It's been coming for weeks. Now I will say this. Okay, to credit to MTG, she did put articles of impeachment on everybody. We had an impeachment week. People laughed at her and said, oh, she's just doing it for social media cloud or just to get attention. I don't think so. People have to do it. She knows no her. Well, exactly because she went to the Department of Treasury. She saw the source report. She saw the money trail. She knew about the checks that were coming in. They knew about the information and do it. Look at the border. The border numbers to speak for themselves. You don't have to investigate anything. The Department of Homeland Security and the border, they'll just give them to you. They'll say, this is how many God-a-ways we have. And the fact that none of that has happened, and here's the problem though. And I'll say this, it has not gone to the floor for a vote. See, I want to know, if you live in the third district of Kentucky, which I don't know who's up there, I'm just saying that, you would want to know, well, does my representative, does my representative want to impeach Joe Biden or my Yorkers? Well, we would know that unless it goes to the floor for an inquiry, that's all it does. And I'll give Kevin McCarthy credit because he did put the impeachment inquiry on the floor for a vote. I think it was eight months too late. And it was an inquiry, not investigation. But at least it's something. At least he got the conversation started. And you'd be surprised how many Republicans would not vote for that. You know that, don't you? I do, but tell me again. There's a bunch. Like how many? I would probably say eight to ten that would not vote to impeach Joe Biden. Not to impeach to inquire. Yeah, not even think about it. Like, don't even think about it, Christina. We're not even going to the right here. I'm not talking about it, Pete, I'm like, I'm just don't even think about it. We should think about maybe something potentially impeaching. Correct. It's just thinking about thinking about doing something. That's how pathetic the GOP is. And I have lost a lot of hope in the GOP. In the party, not all of the people. In the party, not all the people. We have some great fighters. That's not great fight. But I tell you what, the gentleman is going to step on the stage here in about an hour and a half. We know where he stands and he fights for stuff. Okay, you may not like them all the time. You may criticize his tweets, whatever, whatever. I get over all of that. And none of that stuff means anything to me. The personality stuff, which I think is a great guy. I've got to know the president like you over the last couple of years. And I think he's a fantastic guy. He is, when people ask me, and I'm sure they ask you like, what is it like? I go, it's like talking to a guy you've known your entire life. Exactly what you see. That's exactly what you see with President Trump. He's a genuine, he's genuine. And he, I don't want to say acts because he's not acting. But he interacts with you in a way where it's almost like you feel seen. You feel like he's paying attention. Like, who are you, Brian? Tell me about what you're doing. And oftentimes, the part that's fascinating to me, oftentimes, he already knows things about you. I would bet that the first time you interacted with him, he was like, hey, how are you doing on Ryze Dieter? How are, like, he already knows. Yeah. He's done his homework. He's done his homework. He's done his homework. So, for slows, that just can't get behind him for the person out of discrepancies they don't like. It's so petty. This country is on fire right now. So, okay, perfect segue. I give you a good segue about Michael and Del earlier, which I think we need to do again. But, the house on fire, this is my response to people who say, oh, I don't like the main tweets. He's too aggressive. He's too mean. If your house is on fire and someone is screaming at you to get out, get out, get out. So, are you going to say, well, you're being rude? Yeah, you're being rude. No, President Trump's tweets, his dialogue, his discourse is screaming, trying to get our attention to say, our house is on fire. I'm not talking about Congress. I'm talking about our nation, our nation, our government is on fire. It is failing us. It is failing the people. And he's explaining that to us in a very colorful, animated way, in a way that only Donald Trump can. And the left is going, but he's being rude. Yeah. He's being rude. Okay, if my house is on fire and someone's screaming at me to get out, I'm not going to not get out because you're yelling. Yeah, no, I agree with you. I'm going to look at that. Yeah, and also with the DEI that's going around in corporate America, I have a very good friend that is a high ranking financial advisor. And he sends me these stuff from time to time and he says, like, I don't know what's going on in corporate America, but we have lost our mind. It's not about what's doing right. It's not about what's doing, what's the best way to country. It's not about customer service. It's not about what's best for the company. It's not about how to make a profit, how to employ more people. But it's all about this globalist agenda. Yeah, Ari, let's talk about, talk about someone who had an agenda. Michael and Dell has had an agenda since he stepped on the scene years ago right after the 2020 election and said, hey, you know what, I want to help save this country. And he went out. He put himself out there. He put himself not only out there on social media, he put his money out there. He financed a lot of the efforts to basically look into the discrepancies in the 2020 election and by doing that, not only did he get canceled by a lot of big box stores, he also got canceled on the financial front as well. I spoke to him just a couple months ago and he said, hey, the rumors about me being kind of short on cash is true. He spent millions on attorney fees and millions in these court cases. So right now, go to his website, mypilla.com slash RSBN, mypilla.com slash RSBN, put in the promo code. It used to be up to 66% off. Now that's changed. It's up to 80% off now. So what a great way to get in front of the holiday season. Go check out our friends over at mypilla.com slash RSBN. He's done so much. He's been fantastic coming out here and he loves the crowd, the crowd loves him. I don't know if I can step aside, show these people right now that are out there here joining us here in this very sunny day here in South Florida as we are live here in High L.A. You can see, I know it might be difficult, but the sun setting behind us, I really cannot wait for that sun to go down by the way. I'm looking forward to that as well. I'm sure our camera production crew and everyone in the studio is like, please, please go down. We're going to have you shoot straight into the sun for hours on end. Also, here's a special programming note and some of you, we have not mentioned it today. After this is over, we're going to go back in the spin room and get a chance to talk to several of the Trump Syrigants. I believe Carrie Lake is going to be back there. Jason Miller, Stephen Chung. There's even a UFC fighter who I know I did who he is, but we'll talk to them. They're going to be back there. So we'll have special coverage immediately after Trump walks off and they take this little bit to get back over there, but we'll go get settled in and be on the ground there ready for you for the spin room, which is kind of cool. It is really cool. And I like a big shout out to President Trump's team, his campaign team, his staff that put these rallies on Justin, Justin, Danny, Joey. All of you guys are doing a fantastic job. Bretton Lucy, you guys are fantastic. And I love how they're constantly coming up with new ways to make this a fun experience, not just for the people here, but for folks watching online and bringing in these Syrigants and actually doing it in a way where people can interact and engage with the Syrigants and with the Carrie Lakes and the Marjorie Taylor Grease and these other big names. They're just constantly looking for ways to connect with the people. And so just big shout out to the Trump team. All right, let's get a quick check of the time here. It is four minutes before the top of the hour. The program's supposed to start at five o'clock, so we'll see if that happens real quickly. I was talking about, you know, how we always, let's fornate. You're like, we're huge, the US is huge and fornate. And I'm not unapologetic by saying when I say I'm America first, Christina, I'm America first. I don't want a dollar going to Ukraine. And technically, and I hope this comes off the right way, I don't necessarily want money right now going to the Middle East to Israel to fight Hamas. I'm all about giving them military equipment. I'm all about giving them the type of equipment they need to fight it. But for one thing, Israel has an ask for it. Okay, they don't need it. They're very highly trained, very highly financed military, one of the best in the world. But I'm all about coming back home and focusing on the problems that we have here. And I've given an analogy the other day that fornates like this, if you were to go on your neighborhood and give every house on the fifth of the month $200. You're like, well, Brian, that's stupid. I don't even know the third house from the left. I don't even know who that guy is. It doesn't matter. Give him $200. What are you doing for me? They're not doing anything for you. Just give them $200. Well, you wouldn't do that. I look at a lot of times our foreign aid to these countries is the same thing. We're giving these countries money like China. We're giving countries that are very corrupt. Like Ukraine, we're giving countries a ton of money. We don't get anything in return. President Trump is going to talk about that. I'm sure tonight I want us to bring in our finances. I want us when we say America first, Christina, I want it to be America first. I'm not saying that we are not a charitable country. I'm not saying that we don't need to give at one point money to Israel. But at this point, we got problems. Our house is on fire. Our house is on fire. And we need to make sure that's that. So I'm not saying it's America first all the time. I'm saying it's America first and then if people need our assistance in the world in the world to fight something like Hamas. And I'm very much want to fight terrorism support in Israel. I don't think they need our money though right now. They need equipment. They need stuff like that. You know what's really interesting? And you and I have talked about this before. I think when we were in Iowa last, we talked about how Israel has not asked for U.S. assistance. So that was a week or two ago. That was a little while ago. And this war has been going on for over 30 days now at this point. And I just realized as you were talking, it almost saddens me that Israel has not asked us for help in this. And I don't know. I don't know that this is true. Obviously, I'm not part of that dialogue. But it makes me wonder, do they think they can't rely on us? Well, that's a great topic. I don't know. It's saddens me because I would love for Israel to see the United States as a very close ally. We're with you. We support. We back Israel 100 percent. And I don't blame them if they don't believe that. We're the pathetic press secretary. Can't even condemn people tearing down posters of missing kids in Israel. Hey, real quickly before the program starts, Birch Gold is, once it sends you an information kit, text the word Trump to 9898. That's Trump to 9898. Now, you could convert an existing IRA into a gold backed IRA. It won't cost you any money. There's no money out of pocket for that. And depending on your qualifying purchase, you could get $10,000 worth of free gold. It's real simple call. Text rather Trump to 9898. 9898. Because all the things that are going on in the world right now has scared me to death of what's happening financially. So go check it out. Text the worst Trump to 9898. That is a Birch Gold group. So yeah, I mean, so to your point, we obviously support Israel. That is abundantly clear. But I think when it comes to just giving people open checks like we've done with Ukraine, and the pathetic thing that Zelensky now is saying, please, anybody just give me a loan, and I'll pay you back after the war. That is ridiculous. That is ridiculous. No, we're not getting any of that money back, at least not from Ukraine. No, we're not. We're not. Well, some of the things that we can expect from President Trump tonight, obviously talk about the border and about the fractured border. How you doing? This is what we do a lot of there. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wonderful. Thank you very much. That's what we love. We always love. Let's just step aside. Let's just step aside and wave to the people. Yeah. So, now that one woman was waving at me, not you. Oh, clarification. Clarification. That woman was not waving at us. My good friend, Bon, brought Cassie right next to me, and I love the guy. They're all waving at Bon, actually. NBC with real nose, folks. Yeah, we have a couple out here. But what a beautiful night we have here in South Florida. As we said earlier, I cannot wait for the sun to go down, because our camera guy is getting blown out with a lot of flares. Yup. It is a beautiful night. It is. It is. I'm looking forward to the speakers tonight, I think here in Florida. I expect the crowd as well as the speakers to be particularly fired up, specifically because this is counter programming to the RNC's debate tonight in the same location Miami at the same time tonight. So I expect them to put on a show in a way that only President Trump can. Yeah. No, I agree. I think it's going to be a pretty lively programming. I agree. You know, this is a great counter programming, and of course, you know, I will go back and watch some of the highlights of the debate, because I like to see kind of what they're saying. Look, I watch a lot of non conservative news outlets, because I love to see what the talking points are. I think it's healthy to see that. Well, it's not funny, and I love it that you say non conservative news outlets, because it's the RNC debate. Yeah. It shouldn't be non conservative. Well, the RNC debate to me has a lot of the Republican Party has a lot of, the Republican Party has a lot of problems. I would just say that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I kind of sound like a Democrat up here half the time. No, I think we sound like Americans who are tired of both parties. Both parties have issues. Both parties need to be cleaned out. And I think that's what's happening. I think we're in the process of seeing that transpire. We're seeing this new reawakening or reemergent of conservatism, and we're seeing it specifically in the Republican Party. I mean, the Republican Party has been dormant, or when I talk about the Republican Party, I'm not just talking about the actual RNC. I'm talking about Republican-elected leaders, elected officials who have been in office or who have been working in politics for several decades, who just really have become very lazy-off air. Let's go along to get along. Don't push the issue. Don't fight for conservative values. Don't stand up for what our constituents believe in, and we'll be just fine. That's not the current MAGA party at the moment. That's not what we're seeing. You wouldn't have these thousands and thousands of people turning out for a party or for a movement that's just going along to get along. So I think I fully expect a very rowdy, rowdy tonight in the best ways possible to counter this, go along to get along party that's having the same thing happen tonight. Yeah, no more to get along to get along party without a doubt. So it's 5.04 here at local time. We'll see exactly the program obviously was supposed to start at 5 o'clock. That's not happening right now. Meanwhile we'll continue to, this is a great time to just go to our website, sign up for our newsletter, go check it out. Grace Saldana has done a fantastic job of putting everything together on the topics that you need to know about. Go to rsbnebr.com slash newsletter rsbnebr.com slash newsletter and sign up. Okay, let's step back in here. I'm just going to do a little homework here. I'm trying to connect to my IFB right now. Okay. So just let people know that's what I'm trying to do. Okay. Alright, during the show trying to download, I got the app trying to do all this stuff. It's a lot of happening, a lot of services is not good. It goes out. So everybody know in the studio. We're live that I'm trying to do all this live and it seems like I'm juggling 5,000 different things right now. You are. And I'll just say I know this wasn't your intention with it, but I will just say Brian Glenn is such a professional and he is so good at his job and I know that the rsbnebr. You're check still going to be in the mail. Don't worry about that. I know that the rsbnebr is no one love Brian and know that he is. Oh, don't break you. You know, you know, you know, there's another thing I want to point out here. Because this is kind of a new thing we're doing. I got to understand back in the studio. We're completely breaking it down right now. These guys in the studio need to understand that I've got a rock concert going behind me and I cannot hear you talking to my ear and I got the volume all the way up. Okay. Does that make sense? Is that painful? It's very painful right now. I can hear Micah say something, but I can't tell you exactly what it says. We're working through it. We're working through it. But no, I'm just so grateful for you and I'm grateful that viewers love you because you're the only person I know who can talk for eight hours with no guest, with no cohost to support you and make the show happen. So kudos to Brian glad to shout out your fantastic. I appreciate it. Thank you folks for bringing with us as we work through some of our tech. No, it's in. I got a text that said, hey, put the IFB in. I'm like, okay. So, but even when the end, it's so loud, you can't hear it. So these are good things that we're learning today. So we probably get some better inner ears that really go in there. We're just working through that. We're going to be joining us. The recap, there is President Trump will start at seven o'clock as he normally does. I think tonight he probably goes for a good hour and a half. I'm just guessing I haven't had. I haven't had the excerpts from the speech tonight. There will also be a spin room immediately after this speech. So we're going to go back and talk to Carrie Lake, Stephen Miller, Stephen Chung. I mean, Jason Miller, Stephen Chung will do all of that. So it's going to be a nice kind of recap tonight for this event. I'm glad you're joining us. Yeah, absolutely. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to this spin room. We're just talking about it. It's kind of a new development for these rallies, something that the campaign really hasn't done before. So I'm curious to see who is in this spin room and how it spins, how it goes. When they kind of recap all of the talking points for tonight, that's what it's going to be. I mean, Trump's going to lay out this 47 agenda, which he has done many times. We could kind of go over that. But the spin room will be exactly what was heard during the debate. What did they say? Which is interesting because, and I said this earlier, I think Chris Christie. He's the only playbook is Attack Trump. That's it. He doesn't necessarily know. Well, he knows he's not going to win that way. He's just a troll. He's a paid troll. Let's see if he got the program. If you start it. Well, let's see. No, it looks like we might be getting close, maybe. There's starting to play the pre-programmed. Maybe, maybe a little bit of pre-programmed here. But it's interesting because you've got, that's his playbook. Now, go to the other candidates. We're at least trying to lay out a plan. Now, I think it's very interesting when you say you want to lay out a plan to fix America when we had that was already in place in 2016. The Trump administration, border security, national security. That was in place in 2021 when they took over. So they, all they had to do was don't touch it. And actually, President Trump says it all day on the deal is go to the beach. Go to the beach. Don't touch anything. It's on cruise control. And so all you're seeing now is a direct result of Biden completely eliminating all of the policies that were already in place. I think that's just, it's fascinating to think about that. These problems would not be occurring if those policies weren't reversed. If he hadn't touched it, yeah. He destroyed everything and then has been hanging out of the beach watching us all suffer. Yeah, watching us suffer. You're glad you're joining us. And also as a reminder, you can follow us on all social media. Perhaps you're not following us on X yet or not follow us on true social. We can simply go to the both of those accounts. We're RSBN on true social, which by the way, by the way, we were with President Trump basically, you know, when you kind of launched the true social movement. And boy, what a, what a huge platform that has turned out to be. Yeah, it's turned out to be so good. And it's nice to have an uncensored Donald Trump, you know, to have a place where they're not taking down his posts. It's always nice that when something happens, especially surrounding some of this legal issues that he'll come out immediately and just get on there and just push out a statement about what's happening to his family and the properties. I thought was very interesting. A couple of weeks ago, I was in at Mar-a-Lago for the event that you were at. Yeah. Yeah, the special event. And we, I walked by a real estate office and down on one of those streets down, you know, West Palm area. And I was looking at the houses for sale. And it was interesting because a small house would be like 12.8 million, a small little house, not even really on the water. And then they said that President Trump's property was only worth 18 million as big as it is and as large as it is. And the fact that it's a club and it's, you know, it's designed in a way that, I mean, people pay to go there. You know, so it's not just a house. It's also a business in a lot of ways. It's incredible. So the injustice of what they're doing there with the whole, you know, they're not even trying. They're weaponizing like appraisal values of stuff. I mean, I mean, what does it stop it from doing it to you? It doesn't. It doesn't. It doesn't. No, and quite honestly, I think it makes it more likely. Here we go. Let's step aside. We have to be very special guests at the back of the stadium. If you would like to meet Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Gilfoil, or Carrie Lake, please make your way to the back of the stadium. Again, if you would like to meet Donald Trump Jr., or Carrie Lake, or Kimberly Gilfoil, please make your way to the back of the stadium right now. Yeah. Is this what's interesting? I can't tell if they're starting speakers or like we keep their false starts. The programming is a little bit confusing, but it looks like a bunch of folks are going to the back because they want to. When you say Carrie Lake and Don Jr.'s here in Kimberly Gilfoil, yeah. That's obviously. Hello, Carolyn. How are you? Yeah. Bring on Lake over here. I seem to come over when she's doing a book signing right now. Okay. We'll start with the end of the video. Yeah. Cool. Alright. Here we go. So it'd be nice if we can get Carrie. Yeah, it'd be fun to see Carrie. Maybe Don Jr.'s. Well, see you soon. By the way, they both have books. That's right. They both have amazing books, Carrie Lake. They had a book release about five, six months ago. We'll get her over and talk about the book. And of course, letters for Trump is in there. Yeah. They've got a couple great books out. Carrie's got her new book out. And then the president has two books out, which of course Don is part of the publishing team on the letters to the president. And then our journey together, which is a photo book, basically. Yeah. They're great coffee table books. They're great gifts for people. So check them out. I also have my book, not for sale here, but it is for sale. I love it. And that guy randomly walked up to you earlier, right? Oh, yeah. That was great. Yeah. They just had it. And he said, they're actually from Wisconsin. And they said, one of the rallies we did in Wisconsin, they were there. And they said, oh, we were hoping to see you in Miami. And we ran into each other on the street. They had my books. So that was really fun. So stealing your vote, the inside story of the 2020 election, what it means for 2024. Check it out. It's available on Amazon, wherever books are sold. Yeah, you love it. You got to do that. And how long will it take you to write that book? Well, I actually wrote it fairly quickly, but so it's a story of my investigation. I was an investigative reporter at the time. And so I basically started writing it. So I wrote it quickly, but I had to live it. You know what I mean? And so I would write a bunch. And then I had to wait and see what happened. So it covers about a year and a half's worth of time. I spent months on the ground in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. I was all over the place. I talked to elected officials. I talked to volunteers, clerks, city workers. I talked to everybody that I could talk to about what actually happened in these states. And give you an idea. And the way I like to summarize the book, and it's a, it's infuriating, but very accurate. Democrats cheated and Republicans covered it up. The, the most frustrating part about the 2020 election was the Republicans. So I, I, yes, it might frustrate you, but it ends very well. You won't be sorry about that. So go check it out. Well, to your point, how many times have I said tonight that Republicans are almost our own worst enemy? Like we know with the left stands on issues. We know what they're going to have react. We've got rhinos and we've got Republicans that just aren't spot, they're just, they're spineless. Right. Especially when it comes to topics that they know is going to get some traction on social media. Because a lot of the gender issues, they don't want to speak out about it because it is a very difficult thing to handle. Because the internet trolls absolutely feed on those topics. And it's one of the worst things. And they're scared. They're genuinely scared of, of any kind of pushback from, from the left and from their own party to be honest with you. Yeah, Republicans are cowards. And I blame Republicans for the current state of our country because they weren't pulling their weight. You're absolutely right. The way our political system works, there's supposed to be a push and pull between more conservative and more progressive values, more liberal values. Back and forth and the loudest voice wins effectively. But the problem is Republicans in office who had the authority to do this push and pull, they got really quiet. And they basically agreed to not fight for conservative values as long as they got to keep their seats. As long as I get to keep my donations, as long as I get to keep this. And it really has caused our nation a lot. I believe this complete mess that we're in is the fault of Republicans. Yeah, and you've got people like Ken Buck and some others that have said, you know, I'm not going to run for a re-election. Debbie Lasco is one. I'm not saying that she did it for any other reason. I don't mind that she dropped out. I mean, I don't think she wanted to be the fighter that we need right now. See, that's the key. And I give her credit for recognizing she didn't want to be the fighter and what Arizona needs right now. That district in Arizona is loaded with fighters. Yeah, it's in Maricopa County, which is great. It's in North Phoenix. And I think it's got like Anthem, the North, the towns and cities that are North of Phoenix and the very tip of Phoenix. So, yeah, they're at well right now in that race. You've got Abe Hameda, Blake Masters and Anthony Kern. Anthony Kern is currently an Arizona state senator who's now running for that congressional seat. And then of course, you've got Abe Hameda who ran against Chris Mays for Attorney General and Blake Masters who ran for Senate. They lost those three candidates that are in that CD8 race. They all were Trump endorsed in 2022. You know what's interesting is the cultural war. We need not only do we need people that's going to fight on the policy front, but we need cultural fighters. Yeah. And it would make me think, you know, you had four Giato Blow and the Latinos for Trump that earlier we talked to them on the streets. And I love what they've done from a cultural standpoint to try to direct the narrative to more of a common sense approach to really reflect America, right? Yeah. But we need people in Congress, we need people in the Senate that will do the same thing and support us culturally because we're being attacked from financially a policy. But then culture, our schools, our media, our news, entertainment, Hollywood. It's been completely hijacked and that's how they get to the youth right now. That's how they brainwash these kids. They think that all of a sudden they need to, you know, change their gender for whatever reason. And if you go back and look statistically over the years, the percentage of people that identified as even gay or lesbian or now trans. They're being taught that. It is incredible. Yeah. Go ahead. You go down below. Yeah. Oh yeah, we are behind. You go behind this, that's fine. Go for it. It is amazing. That percentage has spiked. I saw a report the other day that it was darn nearly 19% of young adults identify as gay, lesbian, bi, or trans. How is it possible unless they have been absolutely told by our media and by culture, by movies, entertainment that this is what you could be. Even though they were raised in a family and they felt, you know, they felt their gender for the longest time. But it was until they questioned it and it took Hollywood, entertain, took the, you know, the music industry to make these kids question stuff. We have to fight back at all of this. And I'm not saying this is not, hey, if someone feels, you know, 30 years old that they're all of a sudden they feel like they are gay or they are lesbian, whatever. That's different. But a nine year old kid does not know at that point what sexuality that they need to change. And the other research indicates that. This is pushing an agenda on these kids. And it used to be that when a man believed he was a woman or vice versa, that used to be classified as a mental illness. And now we're supposed to believe that it's progress. How is it progress when people, when it's, it's harming people and hurting their lives? The idea that trying to change your gender will somehow make you happier and cause you to feel complete. Honestly, it's a lie from the pit of hell. It's not true. It's going to cause more problems and it looks like our programs are getting ready to start. Maybe. Well, also I think what you need to understand here. Let's just pause for a second. I don't think so. What you need to understand. It's messing with us. Yeah, they're messing with me right now. The pharmaceutical industry is one of them is one of the that gender firm here is one of the most emerging sectors in the pharmaceutical industry. So there's a lot of money going to these procedures. So if you have someone in office that is taking money from big pharma chances are they are being told to wait a second. Let's not push back on these surgeries because this is a big part of an emerging revenue sector from the pharmaceutical industry. So not only does it get down to a cultural what's right and wrong, what's biblically right and wrong, but now it gets into a money play. It's a financing play. It's a fundraising issue here. And so they're putting fundraising over what's right and what's wrong and that is wrong. It's criminal. It's a criminal. A mental and physically sick ill troubled populace is big money for a pharma. And so they're pushing policies that will make us sick, that will make us ill, that will cause us to be dependent on pharmaceuticals. And you know what's interesting is I'm a big fan of mental health support and therapy. I've used them in the past. I've used therapists in the past. It was great. It's not a tool that I think anyone should need for their entire life constantly, but I think it's a good tool to use when you're going through something harder. You know, you need to sort through things. But the mental health community has become so woke and has become so crazy, particularly about these gender issues, that I think it's hard for these people who are struggling with this to actually get real help. Because the education system for the last several decades has been pushing this narrative. And now these therapists and mental health experts buy into it and say, oh, if you change your gender, if you believe, if I believe I'm a man, I am a man. Okay, that's like a whole other thing that's going to cause a lot more problem than the fact that you're struggling with the ideas. So my heart goes out to people struggling with that right now because I think it's hard for them to find real help. Yeah. And then on top of that, I know President Trump talks about this a lot, is keeping men out of women's sports. And that seems like a no brainer, but you'll say this, could you ever imagine, and in 2023, we're having to tell school districts, sports leagues that we don't need to put grown men and women's sports. A, it's not fair. And where are the feminists on this? They should be going crazy. They should be going nuts right now. But it's, it's, it's, it's not safe. It's not safe. Men are physically born stronger, genetically, we're stronger than women. So if you take somebody's context sports, UFC boxing, any one of these context sports, they're going to see injuries happen. Right. And we've seen it already. He does the weightlifting story. So well, and I hope he does it tonight with that. But, um, in these, but that's how crazy. Like, where, how did we get here that we have to convince people that a man should not compete with women in a sport? How do we get there? You know how we got there? You ready for it? Wait for it. Weak Republicans for not pushing back on it. So what we do, what we did 15, 20 years ago, when this movement started as they moved closer to us, all we did was we backed up a little bit. And we said, no, no, and they pushed us back. We backed up a little bit and we backed up a little bit. And to the point now, we can't back up. It's obscure. It's a clown show. So now we have to fight back or we're gone. And it's all due to weak Republicans. And I'm talking about both bushes. I'm talking about all majority of the old school country club Republican that we were too good to fight anybody. Everybody. Everybody. Everybody. And that's why we have so many problems today from the cultural side is because we never fought back ever, ever. We took, we took it and took it and took it. Now we have to fight back. And we're in a position that we have to have fighters or we're not going to win. So we didn't need that 15 years ago. Right. Right. But now we have to have fighters. So if you're in Congress, you're in the Senate, and you're not willing to fight for America and fight for what's right and fight with these American people here for them, get the hell out. Go do something else because you're literally killing this country. And it's so odd. I've thought about this. It's hard for me, especially for Republicans. It's hard for me to understand. Are they okay with the fact that they're destroying this nation and they're just looking at this going well, at least it'll be okay. Well, I'm an office and I'll be protected or are they so blinded because they've been so brainwashed by the establishment and by the political class that they are members of. Both. I know for a fact, and once again, I'm not going to name names, but there are people in the Maga movement, right. That will tell you, but Christina, we have to fight Putin because he's going to take over Poland. He's going to take over all of Europe. He's going to do that tomorrow if we don't keep fighting. There are people that actually believe that why because they're getting intelligence reports that are absolutely false, made up to build up the hype for all this military invasion. You know this, you have intel reports here in the military. Yes, it's also a cop out because it's much easier to say, oh, I'm fighting, I'm fighting for freedom over here, you know, on the other, on another continent. When the fight is on our door, the fight is on our border, the fight is in our schools, the fight is in our government, the fight is in our state houses and senates, the fight is in our governors mansion. That's where the fight is. And they're too scared and they're too scared to confront it directly. So they go, oh, Russia. And they say, I'm just going to go look at Russia. That's not where our fight is. Our fight is here. Are they say they'll take the 1980 talking points or Christina, if we don't go over there and fight them, the fight's going to come to us. It's already here. It's already here. And you know what? And it's due to weak Republicans now. Now this is not the I hate Republican hour. I don't want to make that because actually it might be going well. I need to read the chats. Maybe people like it. But they know what they like. They like strong Republicans. They want action. They want consequences. And we have some of those. We do. I must say, yeah, we do. But it's just the old way isn't working. It's not working. And we are now in a situation that we're in a desperate situation where we must act now. All right. Yeah. Look at this step aside. Show the crowd real quick. Or when hour well into the 528 here local time. Yep. And looking in the back, I see a bunch of people back behind the risers, clearly trying to get some merch signed by Don Jr. or Carrie Lake or who else? I think Kimberly. I think they're the ones in the back. Yeah, maybe. And I know you got Steven Chung. Yeah. If you have a USC fighter, which is great. I'm not. I just mean in the back right here. Oh, you're so. No, no, no, I mean, I think the folks here have gone to the map to me. Absolutely. Don and Carrie. Absolutely. And you know, I would imagine that if I'm guessing that this program will not stop until they get the line kind of down over there, because this is obviously a big part of, hey, people want to see Carrie Lake. They want to see Don Jr. They want to buy a book. So why not get involved? Yeah. And that's a fun experience. Buying a book at the rally, having Don Jr. sign it, having Carrie Lake sign it while they're here. There's still a lot of room for folks. If you're in the area and you want to come out, it's pretty packed. It's very full. But there's there's plenty of room and plenty of seats for folks if you want to come to. And the wonderful thing about this Christina's. I think you and I have been spending a lot of time in Iowa and New Hampshire. We're finally back in Florida. Yeah, we're back in Florida. And I want New Hampshire events, you know, these. These are more caucus related or primary related events have been smaller. They're smaller, the more intimate, they're targeted at very specific communities. This is just another rally. This is actually Christina. Maybe the first like formal rally that we've had in a while actually. It's been a while. So it's fun to see the big crowd come back out again tonight. And as we said, you know, it's 530 right now. So people just got enough work. I do expect more folks to come out. As you can see up at the front, there's still a couple of seats up in the back where, you know, that'll fill in quickly. And there's several people behind the risers right now who are. Shopping and getting book signs and all that. So it'll fill in here shortly. Yeah, it's a lot of familiar faces walking around in the crowd. Not only you got the front row Joes. Yep. You've got a lot of the media people that were used to seeing cover all these events, which is great because, you know, it is. It is, it is a family. Sometimes it's a dysfunctional family because we don't always agree politically. We, we open up with some of some of the other conservative networks video. We see the same folks and even, you know, shout out to Vaughan from NBC. Yeah. He was the next to us. What a what a you got to be tough to stand next to us. He's back. Checked us right on the flyer. He would. I want to talk about my pillow com. Mike Lindell, but what a trooper to basically go through. All that he's done with the lawsuits and the cancellation, the financial cancellation, all that good stuff. Go check it out. My pillow com slash RSPN. Don't forget that promo code when you check out. And you know, what a great time you get Christmas presents right now. I mean, we're coming on, you know, forget about Black Friday. Just do it right now. Go go the website. My my pillow dot com slash RSPN promo code RSPN. And you'll get up to 80% off some items. You're great time. Have you even started remotely Christmas shopping right now? No. No. I. I don't start Christmas shopping until after Thanksgiving. That's terrible. I'm also not a good gift giver. I hate to admit that the problem is my sister. If I don't know if she's watching right now, my sister is the best gift giver. I know not only does she give the perfect gift that you're like, how on earth did you even think of this? Yeah. But she wraps it in like beautiful, you know, the custom wrapping paper with the ribbon. Oh, she does it all right. Oh, she's so good at it. That is not my gifting. And I never will compare to her. So if you go to my pillow dot com, don't not only you're going to save some money, but they're going to ship it for you. They're going to, you know, and actually, I remember last time. When the last holiday season, we were telling people, what have my gone? Because you need to order. You know, ahead of time, you have to allow shipping for products and things like that. So why not do it now? And I have to worry about, oh my god, is he going to be shipped in time or, you know, who knows? And I will say this, though, have you tried pricing out a lot of shipping? You know, if you bought something online and priced out shipping and handling, it has gotten ridiculous. And of course, that's because the energy policies are horrible. Gas prices are high employment costs are going through the roof. So yeah, it's all right there. So go check it out my pillow dot com backslash RSB and that is the website for you. 533 on this beautiful night. Once again, if you just now joining us, we started this off at about two o'clock here, local time. And so if you missed any of the outside stuff, we did a lot of interviews with a lot of fans, a lot of supporters here that are here, which is why. There were a lot of Cubans here. This is a very, yes. We did random polls. You know, we didn't know who any of these people were. And I think over the, over half of the people that I interviewed were Cuban. You got a few Cubans. We got a couple Israelis. Yeah. So there. Well, President Trump did very is polling very well in the Hispanic and African American communities, but matter of fact, more than he did back in 2020. So, you know, and then they've always said, if you can get those two demographics, if you can bump them up a few percent of his points, that really does put a squeeze on everything. And then the independent voters, President Trump is already dominating that as far as they had to have with President Biden on a general election. So he's got some really great things that are happening. And that's why they're going after him so hard on the legal front and trying to get him off the ballot because they know they can't beat him. Right. They can't beat him legally. They have to try to cheat. They have to. I mean, they, they look because if you look, here's a thing. If you debate on policy, they lose. Right. If they try to debate on personality, see that's what they want to do. They want character smears. They want personality. You know, they want to they want to basically, you know, diminish someone's personality and they want to. They want to cause them on a racist and you just hate them and you just hate them just because no matter that the policy is actually best for you. Yeah. But you want them to hate each other based on character smears and it's wrong in fact. But that, but that is the state of politics in 2023. That's exactly how it is right now. And it's a shame that we've gotten like that. But hey, if you go back, if there was no president Donald J. Trump in 2015. Okay, let's let's just let's just play a little little little fancy game here. If President Trump did not run in 2016, who would the nominee you think would have been for who would have been president or at least the nominee? I don't know if they would have won. Okay, Hillary, what a one. But who, which Republican would have emerged as the, as the primary? It would have been somebody really stupid. So many, very milk, milk toast. So milk toast. So squish. So squish. That's not how we like a Mitt Romney. They probably would have been like a Mitt Romney. 2.0. Yeah. Jet bush. Yeah, maybe one of them. I'm not saying check cruises bad. I'm not saying that at all. Well, I mean, he's better than some. He wouldn't be when he wouldn't be. He wouldn't be. He wouldn't have been there's only one person was going to be Hillary without a doubt. And I think it's interesting when it comes to polling. We had this conversation with a friend about polling. I said, you know, the polling so high on Trump. They said, well, polling can be wrong. I said, no, polling was wrong in 2016 because it was propaganda. Yeah, because that she had a 90% chance that she was going to win. And trying to push Hillary and to deflate all of their expectations. They didn't do real polls. They didn't do real polls. Now the polling now. But you know, who did do real polls? Donald Trump. He was doing real polls within his campaign. And they were figuring out they're going to win this. They're going to win this. They knew it. They knew it. They knew it. It's going to be interesting election night. And by the way, on January 15th is the Iowa caucus night. They're at 7 p.m. January 15th. I want to be live in Iowa and Christina. I had this idea the other day. I don't know if you were with me. I think you were with me. And I said this. And it's crazy. But I want to go live from someone's living room at a caucus. I don't want to caucus at a middle school. I don't want to caucus at a big library. I wanted to be one of these someone's backyard or someone's garage that they got these people together. And they said, okay, let's hammer this out. If one guy likes DeSantis and one guy likes Nikki Haley, I want to see debates there. I want to see all of that. I think it'd be fun to do that. So I put that on social media a couple of weeks ago and people like Kentucky and people in California, like, well, you can do it at my house. I'm like, well, I said, I will. I want to do an Iowa. It's only fitting to do the Iowa caucus. I love this sentiment though. People get excited when they hear that you want to go to a house. I want to do it. It's got to be an Iowa caucus. It's got to be an Iowa. So if you live in Iowa, please go to my social media at Brine Glenn TV across the board. Just DM me and say, hey, I saw the rally. You. But in order to do that, you have to be a caucus captain and you have to be hosting a caucus. Yes. Okay. We have party at your house. Yeah. Even though I'm open to that too. But no, I want to. You have to actually be hosting a caucus. Yes. Host the caucus and and make sure you go down the. I'm going to I'm going to bet you I'm going to make sure that you're your your your restaurant Republican. Like actually put this out there. Yeah, we're going to put this out on social. So hey, if you live in Iowa, contact me. I'll go live from your caucus January 15th, 7 p.m. Contact me. And of course, you've got February 13th. New Hampshire is right around the corner. So this is a strategy from a team Trump. Is to basically take those four early states. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, come out of the gate with four states. Sweep it with a strong with a strong win. He's got it. That's how you do it. That's their plan. And that's why we're going to go into. I've been told off the record after there's going to be a couple more stops this. This month in Iowa in New Hampshire and likely in Nevada. So they're going to try to hit them hard before the holidays. So anyway, that's my idea. So folks, if you don't like it, then don't sign up. I don't you know, if you like it, you have you want to. Hey, let's have a party while we're at it. Why not? I'm not I'm not. I'm not. I'm down for parties too. I just didn't think that was your intent because what don't we know? I don't know the like if the caucus is at seven p.m. Do we know the outcome by 10 p.m.? I mean, do we know the next day? No, I think we know that night. Okay, then maybe we have a party that night. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. I'll just make my flight two days after the caucus night. So I can have time to relax. We're covered. We're covered from staying up all night. I don't know how crazy I wins are. But yeah, we could. I have a great time every time we go to Iowa. It's the nicest people. And I actually know what's let's talk about this for a second. The mega movement is nice. Awesome. I also love. I don't care where you go. These people. They love they love this country. They love the heartbeat of America. They love the president. I love our people. Now, where where is the Joe Biden rallies? Where is the left rallies? Where are they? And what does it look like? I've often said this. If you look at some of these Democrat events, where's the American flags? No, they fly the Palestinian flag. I hate the Jews and they burn things down. Okay, the other day I was driving towards the Capitol to the front of the Capitol. And I noticed that these big destruction fences because they're doing amazing work on redoing the outside of the building. They got this fences up. It looks like January 6th, but they have them up for construction. Would you believe that they are massive posters of free Palestine, free Hamas or all this garbage, Palestinian flags, on the fencing in front of the Capitol? Now, I was this close. And I mean this close from going over there and taking them all down. Because this is the people's house. Is it not? It is. Okay. Well, I personally do not think that anywhere on our property, there should be flying anything other than an American flag. Especially if you've got some Palestinian flag, which is governed by Hamas that was voted in years ago. So don't tell me this is not about. Why do we have that stuff on our fences? Maybe I'll go back and do it next week. I don't know. Maybe I'm sure I'll probably get attacked for doing that. But once again, Christina, when I say America first, I mean America first. I don't mean Palestine. I don't mean Palestine first. You called it several, I don't know, rallies ago. This is the new BLM riot of 2020. Correct. Correct. This is what they're doing. There has to be fear. There has to be violence. There has to be some agenda that people go, oh, it's terrible. We have to fight for them. Don't look past the fact that they're all lies. Like what's coming out of this? Remember, who is the aggressor? Israel didn't attack Palestine. No, I think paratroopers came into a music festival. Correct. And beheaded babies and killed pregnant women, killed 1500. I mean, they're the ones that threw the punch. That's correct. That's correct. Israel has a right to defend itself. And Israel should defend itself. And so this idea of Oceus fire, cease fire. And the fact that we have American politicians calling for a cease fire just irks them. Oh, yeah. So bad. If I came and punched you in the face and said cease fire, cease fire. That's, I mean, there's a lot of... That's a great analogy. That's what it is. And they're like, oh, Israel should have fight back. No, no. Or if I'm like really, because Hamas won't stop. They have already said their stated goal is the eradication of the nation of Israel. They don't think Jews have the right to exist. And all of this propaganda that's coming from the last, unfortunately, coming from probably many donors within the United States, we can suspect a few. It's propaganda because they want the eradication of the Jewish state. That's exactly what it is. And this is the latest BL movement. This is what is going to get these kids all worked up. It's going to go around the cities, around this country, on the weekends, during the week, court houses, public buildings. Doesn't matter capital buildings. This is what they do. It's an emotional movement because unlike civil justice, unlike BLM, unlike equality for women or the climate change. This is a spiritual, this is a holy war. When you get religion into the mix, it gets people very emotional. Especially with a religion where you get points for dying. I'm not trying to be disrespectful of it, but I... No, I mean, the fact that you do your religion rewards you for killing people. Well, but my point is this. It's a movement that is going to build because what they're doing is bringing in marginalized groups to get into their movement. They're getting in the LBTQ movement. Come on in, joining us. The climate activists, come on in, join us. The BLM, come on in and join us. Any group that has been marginalized, they're making this massive movement. Whether or not they know, they're really welcomed in that movement if they were to go back to Palestine. You raised an interesting point. The climate change movement. Remember how they were like, oh, it's domestic terrorism and then climate change is the next fixing. That's what it was, right? It was, it was, it is. We got to save the environment, we got to save the environment. The interesting thing about it is they've almost jumped past climate change into World War III. Yeah. Right? It's almost like climate change wasn't enough for them to keep their hold on power, so we've got to go further. Now we've got to go to war, like all out actual hostilities, actual armed conflicts. Who would ever think that these purple-haired freaks that are out there claiming, you know, BLM and East and tolerance. They're going to be the ones that are going to get caught up in a draft one day and they're going to come cry and scream and go, they're not going to want to go. No, they want to put it else in the air. They want it else to go. Yeah, yeah. Not me, you. What are you? I volunteered. I joined the Marine Corps. I joined the Marine Corps. You probably served the toughest one there is. Well, Marines. Yes. That is the toughest one. Like if there was one I would probably say, I'm not quite sure of that. I'm going to opt out. I'll go into the Navy or something. So the race is a great difficult. You served this country. Do you think our youth is ready to step up and serve this country if they're called upon? I think some are. I think where I'm getting ahead, Jake. I don't think they are either. I think you know, I don't want to demonize the youth because I think we have some really good people in the younger generation. But I want to ask you and I don't know. I don't know how this is going to go. We might have to quickly change the subject. The drafts you had mentioned the draft people getting drafted and these crazy liberals don't want to go. They want everybody else to get drafted. Do you think women or men do you think what do you think of our draft? Do we need a draft? Should we have a draft? And if so, do should women be required? Yes. I think we need a draft. If we need it, let's do it. I'm hoping we have no people that want to sign up voluntarily to serve our country. I'm hoping that's the case. But if they need a draft, I want to draft. And I want to draft anybody that's willing to serve anybody. Now, now I know the debate is on like trans women and all that stuff. But I mean just regular women right now, biological women are not required to register for the drafts. I just want to make it easy for you. They're not required. But if they want to, obviously they can sign up. I mean like you. I signed up. It's a good question. I don't know. Here comes Carrie Lake. Let's see if we can get her. Oh, there's Carrie. You can see the crowd cheering her on here. She's right down below the camera. It might be tough to find her at this point. The great Carrie's on her way up. Carrie's on her way up. Let's squeeze in here. No, no, no, no. It's all three. No, all three. All right. Oh. Yes, right now. Oh. I don't have any water. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Carrie Lake. Yeah. Amazing. Are we on? We're on the air right now. Well, live. That's the way we're all casting. Good to see you guys. It's going to see you. What a gorgeous night. And the people here are so incredible. I'm going to be here with you. And this is amazing. Let's talk about you. You're all over the place. We were just talking about the US Senate race and how we think we have to get Carrie Lake across the line because the way you save America is you save Arizona. And we need a fire brand like you in the Senate big time. Big time. Call me a fire brand. I'm just a mom who wants to make sure that our kids have a future. And that means putting America first. And that's why I love President Trump. Almost everybody out there does because we saw when he was a president, we had four great years of strength. We had an economy that worked for us for everybody, by the way. And we had a secure border. National security was strong on a world setting and the world stage. We were strong. We had peace in the Middle East. And now it's it's a polar opposite on all of that. And so we got to get people in in the Senate in Congress who are going to back up President Trump. And he gets in the White House so that his agenda 47 can get passed. Well, we spent about 90% of today and Christina will tell you attacking weak Republicans. I think the GOP, not all of it, but our biggest problem is we have the most weakest Republicans that I think we've ever had. And they're not willing to stand up and fight. I'm not talking about going on social media or getting on C-SPAN or doing a five minute clip and pushing it out. We're talking about voting, holding people accountable, carrying the American people are angry. They want accountability for what's happened in this country. They're angry. Arizona's are angry right now. Yeah, of course they are. They're watching the straight be overrun. And then they vote somebody in and they think they've got a fighter, a Republican, and then they don't do what the voters had sent them there to do. Right. And so we need people who are going to go there. The problem is so many of them go there and they're worried about their next election. That's what it is. I got to win again. And it's like, you know, you should go there acting as if you're going to sort of one term really. We need more people who go one term. I want to get things done. Yeah. And then if you do the job, then you try for the next term. But we just need people who can get in there and do the job. And we have watched as Republicans sadly. They're supposed to be the tough ones, right? They back down from noble fights that we should be having. I always say they sometimes are the party of surrender. And we have surrendered Brian every single day. We have. We are on the last hill. And we are not going to surrender this hill. I'm not going to surrender. I'm going to stand up there. And if they're going to try to get me, they're going to have to come to the top of the hill and drag me down. And when they're going to find at the top of that hill is a bunch of vet up Americans, a bunch of mama bears who are not going to let this country go to hell in a hand basket. And we're going to fight like hell to save it. Yeah, because we said this earlier, since we haven't fought over the years, now we're in a situation we have to fight because we were so squished for 10, 20 years. We let the left slowly push us, slowly push us on stuff. And now we're at the houses on fire. We need to put it out. And you have, and you get, we need bold people. And that's why I'm so glad. And I think people are afraid though, because we saw a bold leader in President Trump. Right. He came in and the fake news media attacked him. If an Americans stood up and said, hey, I like President Trump, they got canceled. Some people lost their jobs. Right. But now Americans are realizing none of that matters. We've got a year to save our country and our most powerful weapon is our voice. Yeah. And this is the year to speak out about what matters, to speak up about your support for President Trump. And some of the people who are going to do see, to help, to help him fight to change American, get it backward, where it needs to be. Okay, you were back there and signed in some books. Just talk about your book that came out a few months ago. Grab it. Here we go. Let's talk about it. You know what, I wrote this book actually. You know, a year ago today was the election that was sabotaged in the American County. It was heartbreaking for the people of this country. And right after that, I started to assemble a legal team and a case to actually fight back and work to reform our elections. And during that time, I had some publishers come up to me and say, would you write a book? Well, I'm going to be honest, Brian. I was not really wanting to write a book. I was in a very dark place. And I thought we could end up being a horror book because I was like, I was like, I was a film. And if it's a film, it's a horror film. Yeah. But actually it was very cathartic to write my story and to put pen to paper and write my story from my childhood all the way up into this incredible America first, Arizona first campaign that we ran that was just really amazing. You covered it. And many, many events. And so it was really cathartic. It's a great book. One of the biggest compliments I got was from a guy who said, I bought your book. I hadn't read a book in 20 years. He said, it's embarrassed to say that. He read it in two days and he said, now I want to start reading again. So it's a very good read. It's an easy read. It's an easy read. I do not hold back the punches. Of course, you knew I wouldn't. Right. And it gives some interesting details on what life was like on the campaign trail. And some of the key figures in politics right now that you know best, including President Trump. Okay, let's turn the back of it. The forward. The forward. So in the back, obviously, it's from Trump and you got the forward as well. See. Yeah, that was fine. Let me show you. You know, it's great when you read the forward, you can truly hear the words of President Trump. And I'm just I'm really proud of him that he continues to get up and fight. He's going through a lot right now. He is. All of these ridiculous cases that are just we're living in a post justice world right now. When's the last time he talked to the president last night? Was he was he beat cheerful? He sounded good. Yes, I called him very late. I kind of forgot about the time change. And we had a great call. He was looking forward to today's rally here. And I'm looking forward to seeing him tonight as well. He sounded great. He's been through a lot. I wanted to encourage him that because I'm out talking to people. Yeah, you are. And they always tell me, please tell president Trump, we are praying for him. We're with him. And I think he knows that. Okay. But it's always good to hear that. I'm being told to rap because you're a very popular person. I'd have you on all day. I would talk to you all day. But your coat and over there is telling me to rap. And I don't want to hog carry a lake of parents. I know we got to see other people. I want to thank you. I want to thank rightside broadcasting. You are truly on the right side of history. We hope. Brian Glenn, you are a national treasure. Oh. And what you do and what you know what you've given up to cover the president and this movement is really important. And I want people out there to realize that we were placed here at this moment for a reason. God does not make mistakes. Keep your chin up. We've got a movement. It's growing. And we are going to take this country back. Our best days are ahead of us. Yeah. And we'll be on the ground in Arizona throughout your campaign. So I'm going to be someone right there in Arizona. All right. Thank you so much. Man in this office. All right. Thank you. All right. There we go. I can't tell you what a treat that is. I haven't seen Carrie. And I don't know how long. I love you too. I love you. All right. Well. I'm going to be a little bit more patient. You can go. You can go. That's gone. All right. That's always a treat, right? But you know what? She. She has really touched on a lot of stuff that we've talked about. And it's that passion that drive to change this country. And we need leaders. We literally need bold, strong leaders. We do. And people love her. I mean, you couldn't see it because you had your back to the crowd. Yeah, I can. The whole place is turned. You can't see it now. But when she came up here, I mean, the whole place turned around. This whole line was was filled in right here with people with their cell phones. Trying to get a picture of your guys' backs. Yeah. As you were doing an interview, I mean, they didn't love Carrie Lake. And you know what's I go back to when I first met Carrie Lake is when she we were both in the business. Actually, well, I had just started right side. And she was working for the Fox Affiliate and Phoenix. And she's like, you know what? I'm going I quit my job because I couldn't take the media anymore, the biased. And I'm going to run for governor. And I thought, okay, well, that's I'm thought to myself, all right. Well, that's that's kind of a first, you know, that's not your first job that you take in politics. But she was adored by the state. She was a natural. Well, she has 80 plus percent of the people, the households in Arizona. No, they know Carrie Lake, from the from the tele. The only two television markets in Arizona. There's two song and there's Phoenix. She had about 80% of the state, the market share knew who she was. So she had that name recognition from day one. She came out swinging. I mean, she didn't hold you. And in point of punches, she got a Trump endorsement. And then of course, everyone, Marge, we endorsed her, Jim Jordan. Everybody endorsed her. It's just Maricopa County. And you know exactly what I'm talking about. And it was stacked against her. And unfortunately, things happened. Yeah, well, it's all going to work out the way it's supposed to work out. And I know that sounds I is very frustrating when you're not sure that that's true. But I truly believe it because Carrie Lake would be an amazing governor in Arizona. And I'm sure the people of Arizona wish that she were the governor right now. But she'll be an amazing senator as well. And she's also one that can flip that Senate seat. Is it better for us to flip that Senate seat or have her and governor? You know, I don't know. But I think I think with enough people getting involved to secure the election in Arizona, which all my Arizona viewers, please, please, please get involved to do that. I think Arizona is looking better. I spent a few days there a couple of weeks ago. And they are making some really good progress as far as securing their elections. So, you know, everywhere, everywhere we need to make improvement on that. But I'm hopeful for Arizona. Yeah. And I think it's interesting that, you know, we always talk about having strong leaders that want to fight. You know, candidates don't want to fight. Many people. Okay. But it's also, you have to be realistic of what is real. I don't live in fantasy land. I don't want to burn the entire establishment down thinking that that's the best for what's happening. That's why I say a lot of times that a lot of people in our party are horrible and they need to go. True. With that said, I have to be realistic that that's not going to happen. You just can't burn the whole system down and start over. So you have to start to maybe put some pressure. And we're weeding them out. Yes, you weed them out and you put some pressure on those that we think that are possible savings. There's people that if we just put enough pressure on them and they're constituents putting a pressure on them, they can vote the right way. Okay. We don't we don't necessarily have to just get rid of them. But we need it. We do we do seem to make some changes that that that's first. Well, I think I think it'll be a couple things. Once President Trump gets through these legal challenges and they realize he is he is unstoppable. He's unstoppable now, but they haven't realized it yet because they think they have all of these traps set for him. Once he gets through those and they don't have anything left to play, I think you're going to see people start to look. Yes, I agree. You're going to see these cowardly Republicans go, oh no, I need to actually protect my constituents or I'm out. And I think it's going to be a massive switch, actually pretty quickly because all it takes is a victory in these legal battles for President Trump for people to go. Oh my gosh. He's not he's not getting taken out. He's going to he's going to prevail. And it's going to be like a. And then look at the way they have weaponized the FBI, the D O J. When President Trump gets in the office and he says this, he'll say it tonight. He is going to take apart the deep state like it's never been taken apart and they know that. Yes, they're fighting so hard. They're fighting so hard to keep their power. So in all of these people that have been weaponizing our government against President Trump, against the January 6th prisoners who have been in jail for years without trial, I mean, what a violation of our constitution. It's disgusting what has happened to those people. All of the people that have been a part of all of that, I think I think we're going to have some real explaining to do. Yeah, I would start with Chris Veray. I would start with Matthew Graves, the district attorney there in DC. And of course, articles of impeachment have been placed on all of those individuals. They just have not been to a point where they're placed on the floor for a vote. Now, hopefully that will change a little birdie told me that could change the next couple of weeks. So maybe we'll we'll see if that plays out. But we have to have accountability or we're done. Christina, we are done. If we can't fight back and hold people accountable for what they've done, then you know what we might as well do? Just move. Just just move. Where does this go? There's nowhere to go. I have one place on my go. And Costa Rica. Okay. I'm sure I'm sure the haters that are watching this right now going, I wish you would leave right now. Just go. Just go to Costa Rica. Probably. No, I love this country. I'll never leave this country. I'll never leave this country. And I would say this. I tell people in California, don't leave California because they don't like it. It's a chart. Oh, it's way too liberal. We'll stay in fight because I think it's much more conservative than people give it credit for. It is a lot more conservative than people think. But if the United States falls, freedom around the world falls. I agree. There's nowhere to go. I mean, we can hope that we can hope that Elon Musk will colonize a planet, too. But there literally is no other place to go if the United States falls. I agree. And you know what the other day I had the opportunity to see Justin. True Doe is just his presidential motorcade go through DC. And even or not. And I wish I could have got this on video. There were people like go back. Go back. Yes, they were both. Yeah, yeah. Close the border. I thought it was pretty funny because you know, and that's another individual. I have no idea how Justin Trudeau remains in power. I think it's elections. I think it's a great election. I don't know. I don't have enough information about the Canadian elections system to actually speak actually on that. I'm just speaking from my sense because I had heard about election fraud in Canada long before 2020. And I was like, you know, we'll can't they fix it. But I didn't I didn't know much about it. And then you see Trudeau continue to stay in power. And it's like, yeah. Oh, there's got to be. This is something that we didn't talk about. We talked about earlier. Did you see the city council meeting last night in Chicago where people are outraged that this conversation of remaining a sanctuary city is still in play. People of Chicago are fed up. They've had 20,000 illegals dumped on the streets there in Chicago and they have had enough. And so people are really lashing out at city council. But yet there's people in city council that still want to designate Chicago as a sanctuary city. And the American people say, you know what? We're done with it. But for one thing, for one thing, it's getting cold at Chicago. Chicago on the streets, they've got the streets and the last thing that I would want to happen. I mean, I have two people. People will die. So from a humanitarian standpoint, I don't want people out there freezing on the streets. But this is what Chicago is saying. And they have spent tens of millions of dollars so far on resources locally to help feed house, clothes, and other resources to these immigrants that have been dumped on the street of Chicago. So this becomes an economic play, but Christina, this becomes a humanitarian play. Look, they need the border. Well, it's true for New York as well. It's true for New York. I mean, people will freeze in New York and the winter if they're out on the street. And then, of course, you've got these hotels that are being basically bought out by the federal government. And I've got to give Ben Burkham has done an amazing job uncovering this. But these hotels have been bought out by the federal government to house illegal immigrants in them. These hotels go for $300 a night that the federal government is paying to house these illegals. And all of a sudden, you've got landlords, you've got people around the area, do not like it. Because what's happening is you have a lot of mischievous activity happening in and around these neighborhoods. And you know what, the people in New York sitting, the people of Chicago are over it. They absolutely are as they should be. And I think it's so interesting. We had talked about this before as well. But the federal government is now investigating New York City Mayor Eric Adams's thunderaser, claiming that there was four and eight or four, you know, some type of foreign involvement in his fundraising. And they're targeting his campaign issues. I think it's very interesting. And of course, if he did something illegal or took forward money, of course, that all needs to be bettered out. But it's very interesting that it comes after he started vocally saying this immigration border is going to destroy New York. It's going to destroy New York. And then the federal government says, oh, we're launching an investigation in the campaign. Yeah, that's very odd that that would happen. They're putting him back in a box. They're saying, get back in your box or we'll destroy you. Right. It's sad. It's sad what's happening. But it makes you and imagine that you've got other cities around the country that are around the border, Eagle Pass, a lot of these small, small Texas cities that quite frankly cannot handle hospitals, schools, police stations. They can't handle the influx that's coming across. And so that is one of the unsolved stories that's happening in the immigration as well. All right. So also let me talk about it real quick. Before we go, I want you guys to get a jump start on your Christmas shop and go over to mypillow.com slash RSBN. And shop, shop, shop. Our good friend, Michael and Dale has done so much to save this country. And they want you. We got to help him. We've got to help Michael and Dale. So please go to the website mypillow.com slash RSBN. Get up to 80% off your entire order. There's some clearance items there as well. Go check it out. Mypillow.com slash RSBN. I can't say that enough because you look, I don't want to look Christmas. Well, here's another thing we haven't talked about. The terrorist threat in this country right now. I've got a very good reliable source that is in the private sector that does personal protection for oil executives, political personalities and people throughout the government. He told me two weeks ago that they are finding pockets of these extreme jihad, which we've all known this. But it's also getting a lot of chatter that as we get closer to the holidays, that is when potential strikes can happen. So I say that because not only do you have to have self-awareness where you go, total self-awareness. Go buy a gun. I don't know if you live somewhere that lets you carry a concealed, go buy a gun, have it on you at all times. But the shop online, I'm just tying it back to this holiday season. You might just want to stay inside and shop online and avoid the big crowded malls. Well, you know how, you know what leads me to believe that Intel is probably accurate or at least somewhat reliable? And that the federal government, the FBI, has come out and said, oh, there may be terror cells in the United States that have come across our open borders. They have known that. That's not news. They've been knowing that. But the reason they came out and said it is because there's a very serious threat and they don't want to have not said it. Correct. So that, that, when I saw the FBI make that announcement, that's when I thought they actually think a strike is coming. Otherwise they would not have said it. You're right, you're right. And they don't want to scare. The American people knew how intimate that threat was. And President Trump talks about that a lot. They would freak out. They would demand that the border get close tomorrow, even though we can shout for the mountain tops that we need to do that. And we need to stop travel from terror-sponsored countries, which seems like the common sense thing to do. They would freak out. And so I actually, I am not bullish. I'm bearish on the safety of this country moving forward. I really am. I wish I was bullish thinking that we're making the right steps in the direction to make sure that nothing happens in our soil. But Christina, I'm not. I don't have any confidence in them by demonstration that they're going to- Please, children. They're intentionally destroying this nation. They're intentionally making us vulnerable. They're intentionally depleting our oil reserves to make us vulnerable. They are intentionally destroying this country. You're not wrong for not having confidence in them. But what happens though? I mean, you know, you start to think about if someone lives in the Midwest in a small town, they go, well, none of this stuff is going to happen in a small town. If you're not in New York or Chicago or DC, especially. But everyone is this can happen anywhere. This can happen anywhere. So, you know, it all goes back to policy. And Biden has the wrong policies without a doubt. He really does. I mean, it's not just that they're wrong. They're intentionally wrong. He has sold out. He has sold us to our adversaries. And he is doing the bidding of our- What Biden is doing. I do want to acknowledge though, it looks like the bleachers are filling in. There's very few seats left on this. There's some closer to the front over here. But it looks like it's all- the seats have all pretty much filled in. They are. They're still standing room on the field available for folks that want to come out. Come out, Jordan. It's actually become a really nice night. It is. Like now that the sun- the sun finally went down. That's what happens. That's climate change. The climate has changed. No, it's a nice night here now. And- It's a great crowd. Not just the crowd of people that are here. But with President Trump, Don Jr. is here. Carrie Lake is here. There's a bunch of folks that are going to be available for comments. Please come out and enjoy us. Yeah, you're going to get a plan to sit or stand in the course. Remind everybody after this. After that speech, when President Trump walks out, we're going to cut to and go to a spin room, which I was told somewhere around here. So we'll get to have a few moments with Carrie Lake or Don Jr. Or Steven Chong or Jason. Tonight from the debate. Because there is a debate going on. Now, whether or not, you know, I personally would love to see once. Let's just get it down to like two people. I would love to have- I want to see President Trump on that debate stage just ripping some of these. Yes. Just ripping because no one debates better than President Trump. No, and I meant to say that earlier, but got distracted. I hope tonight he is in true Trump form and just tools the heck out of everybody that's at that debate tonight. Yeah, I want to see every single one of them. Nobody is safe. I want to see him talk about Chris Christie, Ron to Santa, Nikki Haley, all of them. I want to see him just crush it. I saw a stat the other day, which is I didn't even believe it until I look it up. The last time President Biden had an open press conference, I'm talking about you step out and you take questions. You didn't ask your question. It was over a year. I believe that. Over a year since he actually stepped- I don't think he is. I actually don't think he is. And that's why I don't think during the debates, they're going to minimize the interaction between Trump and Biden. Trump is- Oh, you're never going to get a Trump- Biden debate? You really don't think that's ever going to happen? I don't think he's going to be the candidate. Okay, but let's assume he is the candidate. I don't know how agree with you on that. I agree with you on that. But if he is, how- if you're a Biden- Oh, but you're putting our lives at risk, Ryan. Yeah, but if I'm a Biden advisor, I do not want to put Joe Biden on the stage of President Trump. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, we learned all of this in 2020. Remember, we can't debate you. He's got to stay in the basement. You're socially irresponsible by talking to people and by being out there in the public. Do you remember this in 2020 was a super spreader of it? Do you remember that? How crazy it is? And it turns out natural immunity actually is better than the vaccine. Yeah. Are we allowed to say that? I think we are. I think we are. Which really amazing. Which by the way, the wellness company, go check that out. Yeah. The emergency medical emergency kit. Go check that out. If we- those guys in the studio want to put that up. Because that's a great point. There's so many things that happen now. And that could- There's so many resources that we have to fight to stay healthy. Right. Think about all the millions- so the wellness company, go check it out on screen. Information, the emergency medical, go get it. Go put in your office or home. It can fight everything that you need. But here's what's interesting. All the millions and millions of money that the government put on getting everyone to go get vaccinated. Right? Okay. All the marketing. How much money was spent on go get healthy? Eat better. I don't know. Christina, the gym will work out. Let's- I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't have all this fried food. I don't know. Maybe we should- Relax. Like, maybe we should fight obesity. Maybe we should- Heart disease. None of that. We focused on just pushing the vaccine. Are you even hyper-mectant? Yeah. Oh, I was actually canceled for a- I actually lost a job because I talked about hyper-mectant. Because you told the truth. Because I- Well, it ended up being the best thing ever happened to him. Because I love right side. But I mean to think that- There's things that social media, the government did not want you, Christina Bob, to say the words hyper-mectant, even though it was a WHO drug of the year that have saved millions of lives around the globe. But we don't want you to say it in terms of a possible way that you can save yourself for- If you got COVID. And by the way, COVID, we know the mortality rate on COVID only existed if you were obese. You're old. You're out of shape. You have pre-existing health conditions. All that stuff was there. But they forced perfectly healthy people to just go and lock down. Yeah. Let's see if we can show these people down there. Aw, he's love showing people. Well, we're gonna put you on there real live. Thank you so much. Where you guys from? Yeah, we're from the South. Dear Phil Beach, Florida. All right. That's around your neck, is it? Is it? I don't know. I haven't left you along at all. Anyway, thank you so much. We love you. We love you. I love it. That's what we're all- That's what we do, what we do. Yeah, no, they're friends. I love our people. I love it, I love our people. I love our people. You know what? America. America loves our people because our people are America. We are the heartbeat of America. And that's why the media and that's why the leftist elitist hate us because it's so authentic. It's so real. It is. They hate that because they cannot replicate it. They can't. They cannot replicate that. And it's amazing now. And here's something we haven't really talked about. The free Palestine, the ceasefire people. They were in front of the White House chanting Biden's got blood on his hands, Jehovah's Genocide, he promotes genocide, all this stuff. And they said they're not voting for him. They had a very high ranking, and I'll listen, wait for this, that a very high-ranking spokesperson for the free Palestine group. And they said, listen to me, Joe Biden, listen to me, all you Democrats and Republicans, we are going to sit out this next election if you don't cease fire, you don't back the people of Palestine. I'm thinking, hang on a second. Did they just say they're not going to vote for Democrats? No, but I don't want them to vote on the election day. They said there's millions of Muslims Americans that will sit out the vote. Good. Sit it out, stay home. It makes it easier to beat you down. That's true. But I think that the left is pushing that talking point because they want to have a justification for switching out Biden. Thank you. Okay, I didn't think about that. You're probably right on that. They're trying to justify why we have to switch him out. You're absolutely right. 616 on the beautiful night here in South Florida. We still have speakers. There was a program that was supposed to start at 5, I think. I don't know. It's just the Christina and Ryan show, which we don't mind doing, although it seems like we got some people walking around. It seems like it's always fun doing the show with you. It's funny. We were talking earlier about getting back on campaign trail and how this is going to be doing these things. It's just walking around. Hi, guys. What you're going to find is you have two or three of these a week basically. These things are going to be a lot. Obviously, we're going to jump on. I do. I'm going to say I don't get to see your husband enough. I don't get to see him enough. I know. We miss you too. I just noticed. Can you show the scoreboard? Did you notice the scoreboard before, Brian? I did not. I've noticed it. They've done that before in a basketball arena, but I have not seen it here. I didn't notice it. So it's 2024, 45 and 47. And it's the third quarter, the third term. It's great. It's a nice little touch. Yeah. I like that. It's just an important part of the game. Let's talk about the Trump advanced team. If I ever decided to run for political office, I pray that I can get an advanced team, a communications director, all of the advisors that he has around him for me because it's the best in the business. Oh, my gosh. Okay. So I moved into my house here and a half ago. When I moved down here to work for President Trump. I love my colleagues. My colleagues are the people that put this on, right? And I was talking to them and I was like, oh, I want to invite everybody over to my house. I want you guys to see. It's a new house. It's not a new house. It's new to me. And I was like, oh, I want you guys to see it. And I go, but I'm nervous because I don't host. I don't host. I don't have that gift. And I was like, I want you guys to come see it. But I can't just order a pizza and be like, hey, let's put on a movie. And so I was talking to the team and they go, oh, we'll do it for you. And then I got terrified because I was like, they're going to blow it out. Like this team, you're going to have Colorado security manning your front driveway. This team does nothing small. They're incredible. And so of course it never happened because I was like, I don't know how I could ever like pay them back or just like justify the level of help. That's funny. I was like, way too much of it, but it was just the idea of having the team that puts these on. Like help me throw a housewarming party under. That is incredible. I can't do it. They're so good though. They're so so good. And for those of you that are wondering, they're really good people. They're just such good people. They pour their hearts and soul into these programs. They're doing everything they can to save this country. And they're doing it by putting on really great events that we all get to enjoy and get to see another opportunity with President Trump. So great job team. And they're all like pros in their individual category. They're great. And so we've had the privilege over the last couple of years to just really get to know them, work with them on a weekly basis seems like. Multiple times a week. And it's just a bit of great opportunity for that. So shout out to the Trump advance team. Hey, if you just now joining us welcome, Christina Bob Brangland here in South Florida. Very beautiful night we have here. It's a very Hispanic area. And that's one of the reasons why President Trump chose to do the rally here. And a very densely populated Cuban American. Really from people all around Central America. We've met a lot of people from Central America. South America here. He's from Venezuela, Puerto Rico amongst others. So and he continues to really increases numbers within those demographics. Yeah. I mean, I. Oh, here we go. Step aside. Pastor Mario Burramnik as he leads us in today's invocation. If we can please stand. Crivening Miami. We are not only here seeing former President Trump. We are here seeing the next president of the United States of America. Much of the other of us, we were from Venezuela. And we came here for freedom. Many of us left Cuba Venezuela for freedom. We never thought communism would come to our shores. We need President Trump so that communism will never come to the United States of America. Let us pray. Father, we thank you for the President Donald Trump. Father, we de-satamos to Angeles alrededor de él y su familia. We declare this night of Miami. The communism will not come to the United States. Father, we declare that President Trump will be our President in November. Father, we thank you for President Trump. We release your angels round about him and his family. And we declare tonight from Miami communism shall not come to the shores of America. Father, we declare that President Trump will be the next President of the United States of America. God bless you, God bless our communities, and God bless the United States of America. USA. USA. USA. USA. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Miami-Dade County Commissioner Kevin Cabrera to lead us in the pledge of allegiance. Buenos noches, hallalía. I'm your county commissioner Kevin Marina Cabrera and it's a pleasure to welcome you today to hallalía. Es un privilegio de alguna bienvenida a hallalía la ciudad que es verdad progresa. Now, who is ready to drain the swamp? I don't think I can hear you. You want to make sure we can hear them in the art center. Who is ready to drain the swamp? Who is ready to defeat Joe Biden? And who is ready to make America great again and reelect President Donald J. Trump? Now, please join me in the pledge of allegiance to the greatest nation on earth. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. God bless. USA. USA. USA. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Miami PD Sergeant Luzlinda Bremer to sing the national anthem. Oh, oh, oh, sing. Can you see by the dawn's light? What so proudly we hailed? And red face washed home in Павелин, Austin where all the comedians plurled, softly adrift by tales of thunder and دづ。 To have our hearts tonight One last thing That I'll look through Let it do you the night When I'm there, once you wait We're saved of the star-spangled banner For the land of free, free, and the world I want to go away God bless you, Hallelujah! They come from different walks of life, but all have one thing in common. They want their country back. Parents who want to take back control of their children's education. Veterans, tired of being kicked to the curb, they believe in protecting the sanctity of life, securing our borders, standing for the flag, kneeling for God above, and an honest days pay for an honest days work. Hilary made fun of them. You can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Biden called them a threat. The migrant publicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic. And DeSantis degradingly called them listless vessels. No, they aren't run. They're great Americans. Who know there's one person who will always have their backs? I'm Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Hi-A-Leah Mayor, Stevie Bovo. Welcome to Hi-A-Leah! This is a Patriot City, and we welcome all of you. For those that don't know about this city, this is a city built by blue collar, hard working people. This is a city that has seen what socialism and communism does. This is a city built by folks from Nicaragua, Venezuela, Colombia, E.C. I'm off in ask, what is it about Hi-A-Leah and wires, so supportive of Donald J. Trump? And the answer is very easy, because he understands us. He made a commitment to this community that he was going to reverse the treacherous policies of Obama with Cuba, and he did it. He made a commitment to make America first and protect our border, and they didn't let him do it, but he will do it! And ladies and gentlemen, I'll tell you something. I've seen a lot of presidents come and go, but I've never seen a president in my life that actually did what he said he was going to do. And now we're seeing what the perception of a weak America looks like. We've got our enemies at the gate, pouring through the border with an aim to do harm to Americans. And my friends, there's only one person who could stop that, and his name is Donald Trump! Now I'm joined here today by some of the members of the City Council, and I want to also welcome all of you. They're sitting here behind me, if they can stand up. I got Jesus to be done. Thank you, Jesus! Jackie Garcia-Romis, the vice president, Monica Perez, who just got elected president of the council. We're so humbled that he picked Hi-A-Leah to do this rally, because Hi-A-Leah loves Donald Trump. Now I'm going to ask many of you that don't speak Spanish permission for one second if I could address some of my folks that only speak Spanish. If that's okay with you, my people are Hi-A-Leah. Hey, I don't know, and the people are Hi-A-Leah. Hi-A-Leah is in fashion, right? We're grateful to the president that complains with what he promises. We're with a president that didn't leave him a governor. But we're going to make America great again. And we're going to take back the White House. And we ain't going to take no prisoners. God bless the city of Hi-A-Leah. God bless the United States of America. And God bless the next president of the United States, Donald Trump. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Before thousands were brutally killed, including Americans. Before Iran helped Hamas plan the attack, killing Americans. Before Biden gave billions of taxpayers money to Iran, Trump played hardball with Iran. Destroyed ISIS. Captain Middle East at peace. Captain's out of endless wars. Through strength. History shows very plainly that evil only respects one thing on yielding strength. When I'm back in the White House, our enemies will know if you spill a drop of American blood, we will spill a gallon of yours. President Trump. The strength we need to make America strong again. I'm Donald J. Trump. I approve this message. As Commander-in-Chief, he always had his soldiers back. Was always there to support them and their families. He kept his promise to keep them out of endless wars. And to never forget about them after they served. America learned having a weak leader can tragically lead to American deaths, which is why America needs strength now more than ever. I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage UFC fighter, Jorge Gainbred, M.M. Hello. Hi, Alia. Miami. Mijante Latina. What's up? I want to first and foremost say, thank God I'm honored that it's here in this city that fights communism harder than anywhere in the country and socialism. We come out of the wound fighting that shit here because we know what that horror movies like and will never ever concede to socialism or communism in this country. This city probably knows better than any other city in the country. Amen. I want to also say that I've been a Betty political events. And I don't really want to call them Trump rallies or MAGA rallies. I want to see it more as a way that ideas are getting thrown. Policies are getting thrown for a better America, for better for my kids, for myself, for my brothers and sisters, and everybody chasing the American dream. But this rally, this one feels different though. My morals haven't changed, my political views haven't changed, my feelings haven't changed. This one feels different and all. You know, because the world is fucked up right now and it's on fire. And it's different. It's not just America this time. I want to take you back to 2016 when Trump took office. World War 3 was on the brink as well. Our economy was in shambles on the ropes. Our border was in secure and in a short time. Trump, rocket fueled that economy, secured our border and brought peace to the strength. There was no war going on. We were involved in seven different countries, eight different wars in seven different countries. Pulled us out of all wars. Had Iran at his knees. Iran with the financial sanctions now couldn't fund all these terrorist groups. China was coming to the table with a fair trade deal. And Russia wasn't starting the wars in Europe. We see in just three years how crazy this horror movie has gotten. So it's time for us to fight now like we've never fought before. Because there's only one guy we know. There's only one guy we know that can do the job. Because when he was in office, he didn't align his pockets with what people were telling them to do. No, no, he aligned himself with our pockets. He aligned himself with our values and beliefs and our freedom. So there's only one thing we could do is fight harder than ever now for Trump. And it's not just enough to show up here. You got to show up here with people there from the other side and convince them to come. And we got to be on social media. You got to grab phones, call people and fucking Tennessee and make it happen. Because we know Florida is going red. But we need the rest of the fucking country to wake up. Because everybody could have this freedom. Everybody in the country should have these laws and policies. I love all of you. I'm just going to ask for one favor before I leave. You know who's coming next. Max Alvarez. Love that guy. One of the greatest speakers ever. So we're going to put our hands very warm for him. But before I leave, if we could just get a, let's go Brandon Chan. Let's go. Come on. Let's go Brandon. Let's go Brandon. Let's go Brandon. Love y'all. Brandon. Juan DeSantis was struggling big time in his primary race for Governor Florida. Poles revealed DeSantis was failing so bad. He was losing by a staggering 17 points. Then DeSantis was saved by the endorsement of President Trump. Trump's support was so powerful just two days after the endorsement. DeSantis took a commanding lead and it propelled him to being elected governor. Like the thing our president for standing by me when it wasn't necessarily the smart thing to do. You're welcome Ron. Unfortunately, instead of being grateful, DeSantis is now attacking the very man who saved his career. Isn't it time DeSantis remembers how he got to where he is? Make America great again. Fill the wall. Then Mr. Trump said, you're fired. I love that part. True this. There's only one person who can make America great again. I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage president of Sunshine Gasoline Distributors, Maximo Alvarez. Thank you. Wow. Hi Alia. Miami South Florida, the entire state of Florida. They gave me five minutes to share with each and every one of you my story. Five minutes. You'll think at least five weeks. Never mind five minutes. But my story is not important. My story is the same as everybody here. Everybody has a story because all of us, all our parents, grandparents, and many, many Americans, are coming from many other countries. Looking for one thing. The American Dream. We're not here today about hearing stories we hear today about looking at facts. The fact is, we must work very, very hard to elect the president who really make America great. And you're here to elect the president that sacrificed everything that he has, everything he worked for. When he could have been enjoying the fruit of his labor because he worked very, very hard. Just like most of us when we came to our country, we watched cards for the living. And this man made it because he said wonderful, a wonderful, business man. Let me tell you. I look at him and the admiration is incredible because I look at myself and I remember when I first started at age 13, watching cards for 50 cents. And today, because of this wonderful, most generous learning the world, I can pay back. Some of the things that I receive when I came to this country, unexpected anything except being grateful that I had a mother and a father who understood that whatever I was going to end up, was going to be much better than to live under a communist regime. Something that not only humans understand today, but people from Nicaragua, Venezuela, and every country in the world where communism has gone, it has been a destruction. I agree with you. It is so very important simply because I cannot think of anybody else who can make America great again, again. I never thought when I first came as a little child, as a little boy, that this country was going to be threatened by what is happening today. I never thought I would leave the dreams that became an nightmare. And let me tell you how honor and how blessed I was simply because my mother and father understood what it was like to be under a communist regime. And then I arrived at this country and what a blessing. I encountered a monsinobriano who was responsible for over 14,000 kids, just like me, unattended, not knowing and not having anything. I was blessed for having attended some of the best schools in the country. And then I started my business. I am just an average businessman. I started my business from the trunk of my car. And these are the things that we need to make sure that we secure. That everybody in this country has the same chance because that's what America is all about. That's what the American dream is. And I don't want to get emotional because when I talk about my mom and dad and I really get emotional, when I talk about monsinobriano I get emotional. When I talk about President Donald J. Trump, I get emotional simply because he is the only one who is fear, who is trying to destroy it every day simply because they are scared of him. And let me tell you why we need him in this country to make America great again, again. What is happening in our country today in the southern border is not about immigration, it's about not invasion. What is happening in this course, not education, it's indoctrination. And I am telling you, Donald J. Trump, instead of enjoying the fruit of his labor, he is devoted his life for our children. For your children, for our grandchildren, and we should never, ever forget, we should be grateful and we should be loyal because as the least we can do, be grateful and loyal to the most important values of the world. Thank you, thank you for being here and making sure that we are like Donald J. Trump as America 47th President. Go America, great again! USA, USA, USA, USA! There's a question for you, just how far are the radical left and inside the Beltway bandits willing to go to stop it? They all know they hate him for winning the fight to protect life, for exposing their deep state, for draining their precious swamp. And they already know he'll crush Biden, so like a pack of rabbit wolves, they attack. So let's impeach him. Let's get Tain and Radical left prosecutors to charge him. Let's conspire with Hillary and the FBI, with fake stories about him. All to distract from Biden's incompetence, weakness, and money grabbing corruption. But here's the thing, he'll never blink. That's called having the courage of your convictions. And it's why he's our President. I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage America's most inspirational mega comic, Roseanne Barr. We will rock you. Buddy, you're a young man, I'm mad, shining in the tree, gonna take all the world's love. Now you've got blood on your face, a big disgrace, waving your banner all over the world. We will rock you. Sing it out. We will rock you. Buddy, you're a young man, poor man, waiting with your eyes, gonna make his heart beat someday. You've got blood on your face, make this race somebody better put your back into your place. We will rock you. Sing it. We will rock you. Everybody, we will rock you. We will, we will rock you. Everybody. Hi, mega. Oh, it's so exciting to be here with all of you tonight. God bless everybody here. It's so exciting. I've never been to a Trump rally before. It's my first one. It's so cool. Wow! It's exciting. I gotta get you to do it with me. USA. USA. USA. USA. Thank you. USA. I love you all so much. I got to get my picture taken with President Trump about a week ago there at Mar-a-Lago, you know. It was so exciting. I could hardly control myself. I went in there and I just, I grabbed at him, you know. He was so nice. He just kind of gently rearranged my arms so nicely. Afterwards, I thought, oh my God, I could have got shot. The way I was grabbing at him with the secret surface, I was like, oh, I love you. I could hardly control myself. I just flipped out. Then several nights later, I saw him again and I was able to actually touch him and hug him. It meant so much to me. That was the night that Shabbat had ended. I don't know if you all know, but I'm a Jew. Wow! That's the first time I've been cheering for that. Thank you. So, Shabbat night and I had just, you know, said all my prayers all day, meditate and I'm praying as I invite you to do for our country and for all the captives that, you know, in our country whose minds are stolen by this terrible regime and they can't get free of it and, you know, we've got to pray for them. But when I touched in my hands, we're full of all the love that you people have given me over the last four years. You saved my life. You built me back up when they tried to take me down. You gave me so much love. I thank you for that. You saved me. And I put all of my, the love you've given me onto President Trump. I gave him 99% of it and I just said, oh, we love you so much. You are our inspiration. You are our hero. We love you. I said, I want you to know how much we pray for you and how much we love you and how much we look to you and how much we hope for you. I want you to know how all the people I meet every day feel that about you because it's true. And you know, I ran for President down here. I was on the ballot in Florida in 2012. I don't know. You know, I didn't win. I don't know if you knew that. But I did run for President against Barack Obama. I didn't like him. And so I decided. Oh, yeah, boo it up, baby. Oh, yeah. And you know, this is his third term that we're living through. You know that, right? So I ran in 2012 because I wanted to run against him. And I ran because I said, this is the time for a woman to win me, not Hillary. But I said, I said, because this is the time for a woman, because anything a man can do, a woman can get another man to do even better. Yeah. I loved you. Thank you, honey. But other thing I ran when I ran for President also ran on the thing one of my platforms was, I will outlaw bullshit. Yeah. And I want to show you this jacket that my friend made. And look at this here. Look at that. Yeah. Yeah. Trump is the Magador. Yeah. And that's the deep state ball. So that kind of went along with my thing for President. I will outlaw bullshit. But I want to say right now, aren't we all tired of the deep state bullshit? I can't hear you. I want you to say a louder. Aren't we all fed up with the deep state bullshit? Yeah. And that bullshit. And that bullshit. We want Trump the Magador to kill that goddamn ball. And the bullshit. Kill that goddamn ball. I love you. Thank you for having me tonight. I'm so excited. Oh, I forgot my assignment. I got too excited. Oh, here, the next person up here is a beautiful woman. She's a lovely person with a wonderful sense of humor who helped me celebrate my birthday, which was just last week. I'm three weeks totally celebrating my birthday for three whole weeks. It's just been wonderful. And she is married. She's in the Trump family. Also, I want to say, please everybody, let's say a prayer of protection and love for the entire Trump family. And I'm very proud to introduce to you KG Kimberly Garfoyle. A giant version of America, a streets of flood with poison, killing millions, enemies and tyrants on opposite sides of the globe laugh at us. Of course, let us. A threat of nuclear annihilation once forgotten is now real again. America's weakness has become their strength. The global elitist who send your kids to war who tell you a woman is a man and a man is a woman who teach your children their country, their faith, their beliefs are lying. They have corrupted every facet of American government, weaponized it against you. While they watch our city's burn and file in crime skyrocket, you and your families pay the price out of control inflation. An economy wrecked a nation in decline. This is Joe Biden's America, failing week. But one man, one movement can change all that for us. Put America in a middle class first and put the globalists the elitist in a corrupt and their place. Bring back pride and the American dream to let the world know. Don't mess with us. One man focused on the true alums at this point. One movement focused on the true priorities. Make America great for us again. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Kimberly Gilfoil. Welcome. Here we go.

Imagine it was say, I don't know The Don Jr. laptop from hell Do you think it would be a problem? Yeah, do you think if I was getting checks from the Chinese government, you think that'd be a problem? We live through Russia, collusion and all of those lives but when you have actual China collusion it's not a problem Because that's what's going on right now in DC folks There's rules for you and there's rules for them The 2020 summer of love riots remember it was a mostly peaceful protest with buildings burning in the background Mostly peaceful, you know If you take over a couple courthouses that kind of stuff, I'm told that's an insurrection but again it doesn't apply that way right? Those people can burn down buildings, they can loot, riot, steal, murder But now in the name of social justice it's different, it's fine You know, yeah I mean the Gucci shoes that they stole that's totally fine, it was for social justice, it's different Trying to figure that one out right? I'm trying, you may do a better job on this than me sir But think about that, think of the people right now in the last couple of months who've been sentenced to 20 years in jail For peacefully protesting, meanwhile I'm watching anti-Semites chanting for genocide At some of the finest universities I say finest in air quotes because at this point they're full of shit They can do that again, no consequence nothing, while they mortgage your family's future to the hilt While they're getting ready to send your children, not theirs, to yet another one of their endless wars But don't worry folks, we're told the adults are back in charge Remember that one? The adults were back in charge, I remember watching our secretary of state right after the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal And I quote, I quote, Anthony Blinken, he said he is shocked and dismayed that the Taliban did not install a more diverse and inclusive government in Afghanistan I mean think about this, these people want us to take them seriously and they're shocked that there wasn't like a trans coalition You know, last week they were throwing gays off of buildings, this week they're gonna have a seat at the table, did you really think that was gonna happen? Yes, you should help me with this speech sir because yes, take down the UN Because all we do, yeah, no speaking of serious people right, the UN has like Iran on the human rights watch Like you know, the world's leading state sponsor of terror gets to sit on that committee I don't know, seems a little bit freaking insane but you know that's just me, I have an IQ Unlike the people involved, they were the same people that were on the woman's rights panel like two years ago I don't know, they don't seem to be in favor of women's rights but minor details right? But we fund all of it, it was like what my father did with NATO You have an agreement, you're putting X percent of GDP towards protecting yourselves They just choose not to pay, my father said we're gonna make you pay your fair share How dare they, because they're used to an America run by freaking morons who are on the take Those leaders have a deal in paper to actually do X but they're like why would we do X if we know that the US will take your harder money And fund it anyway Right? While you can't afford grocery stores and guys I'm not pretending like I get it, I know where I'm from I'm the son of a billionaire from Manhattan and if I go to a grocery store today and I'm pissed off No, what does it tell you? How is it that I get it and they don't? Again, they want to get us in another word, Chuck Schumer, Mitch McConnell Yeah, no All right, we're gonna do a little survey because the fake news is here and covering this and I've done this A little survey from the crowd Because I hear from Mitch McConnell that funding the Ukraine is the number one priority of Republicans across America See it sounds it sounds like you're with me, but I'll take a chance there's There's No, no, no, I saw Mitch when he wasn't doing a Mitch glitch, you know what it's just Sorry, sorry When Mitch wasn't in glitch, he'll tell you that funding you craves the number one priority for Americans right now Republicans across the board and I say this like I have been in front of this crowd alone would have put me in front of more real Republicans that Mitch McConnell has ever been in front of in his tire 4,000 year career All right This is like that close to the 20th time I've done this this is the largest group but between two and 5,000 people I've done this Raise your hand if funding yet another never ending war in Ukraine is a top three priority for you in this room So you're not raising your hand you're booing right yeah, okay All right Yeah, how about isn't a top 10 issue for you? Has a single hand because they'll call me fake news. I'll be canceled. I'll be thrown off social media I'll be put in the Google logs where the Democrats would put us all if they had a choice Did anyone see a single hand go up that funding Ukraine is a top 10 issue for what? 10,000 people here Not one I got one person one time he raised his hand one person It wasn't a top three issue. It was a top 10 issue for him and I said sir. Why is the top 10? Well, he goes I'm from Ukraine. I was like okay, I understand So now we've surveyed about 30,000 people and I have yet and one guy But it doesn't matter he'll still do that He's still gonna try to roll the new speaker of the house to believe it They're gonna put in front of him Intelligence reports folks, and you know what those intelligence reports are Also bullshit. Yes, it will be propaganda designed to get whatever the deep state wants So Mitch Senate Republicans rhinos Listen to the people here for once we would like some actual representation from our representatives This should not be that hard folks and yet it is Those people who we send to DC need to actually start listening to those who send them there Not to do what they want Not to get some board seat at Raytheon to sell more missiles To mortgage our children's and our grandchildren's future So we can fund some of the most corrupt countries in the world and get nothing for it Happening in Ukraine It happens every time because you know what they don't care Well their retirement plan is to get on the boards of those companies you only get on the boards of those companies by selling more missiles And it's a vicious cycle that goes forever It never stops. You know what? I'm not sending my kids or yours to go die to get Zelensky another house No way and if they do vote them out They better start listening is that's what's going on where are the checks and balances what we have none You can just so we're clear Prior to them becoming The you know the next deity right the left has deities it went from climate change led by Lord priestess Greta Thumburg Covid became the next religion of the left right that led by high priest Fauci And in Basil, but you know what difference does it bet? Now it's Covid now it's Ukraine I don't know It seems fair because I know Then if I lied to the American people the way he lied to the American people in a position like that I'd be in jail No, I would because and you know why he you know how he lied because his emails to his colleagues in medicine are the exact opposite of Everything he told the American people He never met a TV camera. He didn't love And this dwarf that everyone probably beat the shit out of his whole life finally had a moment Right finally had a moment was on the cover of every magazine He has the page making millions of dollars and other stuff while lying to all of us This is how our government functions. There's no accountability for that but Joe Biden And Hunter Biden and the Biden grandchildren and Joe a hunter's mistress and Hunter's girlfriend, which is also his wife his brothers wife, but I mean They can all take money from China and nothing happens. I'm wondering why grandchildren, you know But your favorite president Donald Trump But Who kept us out of wars? Who put us in jobs? Who led the strongest economy in American history? They want to put them in jail for a thousand years and maybe the death penalty because like we all understand that he is a very young and vibrant man unlike Joe Biden But a thousand years still feels like a lot doesn't it? Seems seems excessive, but that's what happens That's what happens when you challenge the power of the deep state the power of the swamp And guys That's why they're going after my father the way they are They understand that now especially now it's worse now than in 16 right in 16 They figured this could never possibly happen The American people would take arguably the least likable old hag in the history of old hags Hillary Clinton And somehow elect this part, you know like Yeah, they're gonna elect crooked and everything was gonna be fine, but now they realize that Trump has your backing he has the American people he has a track record now of actually winning and getting things done You guys make it easy for me Yeah, I like to come up here organic. I don't have the no it's not like Joe Biden right struggling at the teleprompter The American people are doing great under Bidenomics pause for applause I Think someone said it best right then you know the stage the stage is about this size and Whatever they gave him to make him he's never coherent, but like borderline semi coherent in about 90 seconds It wears off and then I forget who I saw it somewhere it was sort of the perfect and Joe Biden turns into a Rumba Well guys I For one now that Literally no one should feel safe that a Rumba has the nuclear codes What do you think happens when they call Joe Biden at 3 a.m. When something goes wrong? Now they don't and you know how they don't because on October 7th When a terrorist organization flew paragliders with machine guns Into a daytime concert murdering and killing innocent women children in Israel We didn't get a response from him till after lunch But think about that Think about that they couldn't bother to respond because you know They couldn't even probably wake him up He wasn't present and you know he's not Again, none of it matters because Joe Biden for the Democrats Has actually been effective pushing the radical leftist agenda and that's what it is today folks There are no more Democrats in power. There are radical Marxist communists They would jail each and every one of you They're not pretending about it anymore because they're doing that to your grandmother who may have walked in between The velvet ropes taking a selfie on January 6th It never ends Right Anyone and anything in their way They will destroy they will lock up their political opposition. They are functioning Like the communist dictators so many of the great people of Haya Liyah escape from When I talk to Guys like my friend Jorge When Jorge Mazvedaldi this we did this in 20 we want to History if he gave you the longer-form version is so incredible with his father and escaping and So many of the people in this very Theater right now Understand what it means. There's a reason that the boats only go one way folks Despite what Bernie Sanders tells you it's not so good. He's telling you great the great virtues of communism and socialism You know from one of his four vacation homes, right? It's a little different but everyone in this room right now understands exactly what we're fighting for they understand Exactly what's at stake and that's why we need to end the nonsense You know the dog captured debate going on down the road like you know No, but that's the problem the Republicans are guilty of this stuff too, right? You know why that's continuing Not because they have a chance you can see that just by looking at this room looking at this area But because there's a couple billionaires that gave more money to a super PAC and the consultants who are all part of the DC swamp We'll take about 60 to 75% of that money into their own pockets by running the ad By hiring their marketing team to come up with another brochure It never ends so they're gonna drag that out They're gonna burn all that money that we could be using to defeat this sickness The depravity That is today's Democrat Marxist communist party You Guys we need to end this nonsense and we need to save our country because it's not gonna save itself our leaders have failed us for decades The results you got from Trump despite unprecedented incoming from your media unprecedented assistance lies and bullshit from big tech Unpressed and dented sabotage from Republicans You got results because you had someone that can actually deliver someone who'd actually done it someone who's actually Signed the front of a paycheck not just been a taker We can do that again guys, but we cannot do it without each and every one of you calling out the nonsense Calling out the bullshit Token to your friends and fighting like you've never thought before Because guys There is a point There is a point of no return and they're hoping they get there they hoping they they're hoping they demoralize you so badly that you think There's no chance that you that you believe that you don't believe you're lying eyes, right? You go to the grocery store. No, no, it's all good No, I saw this this was did you guys see the last week in the New York Times Paul Krugman No, Malorie economist, right? He won a Nobel Prize in economics and he says no No, he shows a nice beautiful graph. It shows inflation coming down the problem is there's an asterisk Inflation he says is going great if you do not include a couple of things Every Every that yeah Inflation is going along perfectly if you don't include housing Energy Food And transportation Hey, if you don't include Literally everything that you need to survive things are going great folks You can get transgender surgeries like 50% off Everything else you're paying like three X that you know minor details But that's what they're doing they changed the way they record the statistics They changed the methodologies they did to make it look great because they think That you're just going to blindly follow their nonsense But we get it We see it as much propaganda as they run and create They can't fool us anymore because we're on to their lives and we see it It's not going to stop them It's not going to stop them guys only you can stop them Only you can put an end to it But I see you Will because we love freedom We love our country We love God We love our Constitution and we are going to fight for our children and the next generation Thank you, Hylia God bless you all thank you You There must be lines burning brighter Something God to All right the kind of wraps up what was a fiery conversation You There's Don Jr. Know how to open up the show or what I mean this is exactly what we expected And everybody hill everybody Brian Glenn Christina Bob as we start our pre show Into the main show so excited president Trump's gonna be coming out soon I think we have at least one more speaker before he comes out But it's gonna be a great rally tonight. It's gonna be a little bit of surprise He's gonna come out here in a few minutes little bit of a surprise somebody I was not expecting but happy to see out here This has been such a fun rally so far and I all the speakers that have come out and The part that I have really enjoyed the most is the local High-A-Layah leaders and the local community that has come out and really spoken to this crowd and knows the crowd Demographics and and the people here. That's been really fun. Yeah the excitement whenever Yeah, someone that one of the Cubans would come out here And you can tell they'll be like Venezuela Cuba, you know Yeah, all right. We're gonna kind of preview some of things he might Here tonight but first we'll talk about our friends over at tax relief and look you know what October 15th was the deadline to file taxes But if you didn't file your taxes do not worry because they have a solution for you No matter if you owe a thousand ten thousand a million dollars if you haven't paid your taxes in a year five years ten years Don't worry take the anxiety out of that the information for that is on your screen take advantage of the fact That they want to help you reduce your tax bill right now go to it. We'll be having a few minutes before president Walks out on stage The energy in this place is electric, you know, this is a thing where you've got a GOP debate I guess going on right now. I'm not sure who's watching it. I'm sure they don't have the crowd that we've got here And it's so interesting we were right about the the fact that this is a Wednesday night debate People had to work all day and so president trump coming speaking We thought he was going to be speaking at seven, but then speaking at a closer to eight o'clock People came after work and man did they pack it out? You know, this is I would guess there's probably ten thousand people here. Maybe There's a lot of people there would it would be close to it Of course And this all builds up to what has been the presumptive nominee for the Republican party and if you look at the polls the latest polls There's a reason why president trump is down here in south florida He leads and he has been really Adding on to the percentage of approval that he's getting from the Latin America population and Cuban Americans down here Central America is down here. He continues to build on that base There's a reason why he's here and I really see that that is going to Translate into as we get into next year Even a higher percentage not only here in florida but across this country across the nation and as they see these Hispanic communities Really pushing to support pushing their support behind Donald trump and really supporting him It's just going to catch fire. I mean it becomes acceptable within the community right so you start to see more and more growth on that So I do think his lead is growing in this demographic and if only going to continue to grow and a lot of that is You know these cultures these Hispanic cultures are often deeply Catholic Very family oriented. They have very strong family groups, you know Their relationships with their families and this woke agenda is pushing them to the right they're pushing them into the Republican camp into Not even the Republican camp. It's into Donald Trump's camp because They've just got these strong family values and in these cultures The left doesn't have it right now and it's interesting because if you look at All the obstacles that President Trump has had to overcome during this whole process legal proceedings You've got numerous legal proceedings of no one knows that's better than you and Still that continues His approval ratings continue to grow because of that well people are tired of it I mean we've been watching this for seven eight years at this point the rush of rush of rush of Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine you know all of these crazy stories about Donald Trump We've been listening to it for so many years that people are just tired of it and they don't buy it Yeah, it's it's continuing okay before we go into our next speaker. Let's remind everybody also go over to birch Golden group. They are the experts and gold silver Impression metals when you look at what's going on with this digital dollar and this this move away from An actual currency that just scare everyone my friends over the birch gold group want to make it really easy You take that first step in investing in gold silver and precious metal simply text the words Trump to nine eight nine eight to nine eight that's Trump to nine eight nine eight to nine eight They'll send you a free information kit matter fact on a qualifying purchase You could get up to $10,000 in free gold the washers show you had a transition from a traditional IRA into a gold Back IRA the birch gold group good partner for tonight simply text the words Trump To nine eight nine eight nine eight that is the birch gold group we talked about the economy with many people Earlier today since we were kicked off this broadcast at two o'clock a local time Everyone's concerned about the economy and it's interesting don junior throughout a question in the crowd about if Funding a war in Ukraine was even in your top 10 of the most priorities right now We all know that no one raised their hand for that right it is simply the economy is what people are worried about the most right now people are struggling due to By nummies by due to so many things certainly by dynamics the open border is an issue Taxes are an issue over regulating so many of our industries that people are having a hard time Making a profit in their businesses education The school system is putting several burdens on parents parents are now having to have the burden of actually teaching kids You know right and wrong values that they didn't have to worry about before but now these kids are being indoctrinated in schools and so Parents are having to modern you know kind of moderate that as well Everything is the Biden administration is doing of adding burdens to the American people You know often talks about taking apart The Department of Education and that's one of the things that a lot of people here He's promised to do that and there's two things that the crowd really erupts and they all has to do with kids and one of them is stopping The gender affirming care on minors that tends to be a very popular thing amongst the base But second of all is doing away with the Department of Education and really Getting our education back to where it needs to be because that is part of the reason why you're seeing so much Chaos right now in our society is because these kids are not being taught the the fundamental things of That you and I grew up on it's more of a woke agenda. It is even I believe it was organ Past a law that said they weren't gonna teach I'm sorry. I'd may have been irregular They were they passed something saying that they didn't want to Teach kids math and reading because I thought it was racist because minority students struggled with those subjects more So we're not gonna teach anybody how to read or do math Yeah, I think that was California was introducing that as far as I think Oregon did it too Norrigan as well So you've got the education of course you got the open border. I was really surprised how many people we talked to tonight That was from Cuba from Venezuela from South America that said The first thing that President Shum should do when he gets in office is to close the border And we're seeing a lot of that now if you miss some of the talking points we had earlier on the show We can very much close the border right now at least get close to it if everyone in Congress would come together And I don't know impeach my orcas and really whole people accountable for what's going on at our southern border That's could be easily done if we just come together as a conference and do that But these border policies that President Shum had they worked they worked yes, they worked As you know, we discussed this earlier, but all Joe Biden had to do was go to the beach Don't touch anything just go to the beach But he undid all of President Shum's policies is look at look at the mess that our nation is then I mean It's is not surprising that we're having the problems that we're having and I think What President Shum did that was so important was he out of the fact that it is the Democrats It is the political establishment. It's the rhinos It is this political class of people who are destroying our nation It is not the conservatives that want to stand for family values and stand for what they believe in Conservative values do not infringe on anybody else's rights It's it works the other way and I think a lot of people struggle to see that before even under Trump They struggle to see that but now under Joe Biden I think people can see it a lot more clearly and that's why we're starting to see this huge pendulum swing of support behind Donald Trump Because people realize that his policies works his motivations were right. They were in the right place And he actually did help Americans and Americans could thrive under his leadership If you look at what's happening in the independence, I mean President Trump is gaining on that as well Music dies. All right looks like we got another video a little danger zone action So independence is going behind Trump You got a lot of I even think moderate Democrats to a certain point because I think their party has been somewhat hijacked Of from the radical left It's not the Democratic party that our parents might have seen when when we were little and even when they were growing up So the party has changed very much. I think that's all in the swing to President Trump I think he can take advantage of the fact this country has been so lost and so out of control the last two years two and a half years That Americans know that the policies that he had work and they know that his personality is strong I mean we often talk about the war in Ukraine and President Trump will probably talk about it tonight That would not have happened if he was in office and people say well, how could you guess how can he say that? Well, guess what Putin know Putin they talk a lot him and Putin talked a lot And there's no doubt that Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if he was in office Of course that well he invaded Ukraine under Obama The last time Biden was in office. He did and then he took a four-year sabbatical while Donald Trump was in office And then he invaded again under Biden So yeah, I think the track record speaks for itself the Donald Trump and I've said this before I actually think Donald Trump even though he's not in office right now the threat of him coming back into office is what is Currently holding back World War III because we know the global powers that we are trying to start World War III The elitists in the United States are trying to start World War III Why hasn't it started because of Donald Trump people know that if he gets back into office He's gonna level everything. I don't I don't mean you know with explosion like he's just going to He's gonna shut it all down So even though he's not in office right now the potential that he could be in office I think is keeping World War III at bay. We talk about the leadership and strength That goes across all levels of government you must have Great leadership that has strength in other words are willing to make decisions in the best of the American people No matter how unpopular it might be with some and I think President Trump did that On the world stage and of course every world leader around knew that he meant business and if you weren't a meeting with President Trump You weren't gonna get over on the United States like they had been getting over on us for decades They changed the game. He was a businessman. He made sure the trade deals were fair He made sure that the the military assistance and the foreign aid that we would give countries What was not just one big lopsided check where the American taxpayers just keep funding these countries for no reason So he has a certain dominance on the global stage and that's what we need right now Look at Joe Biden and we can do jokes aside and there's means obviously of him falling down and tripping But he is a weak old man and all due respect. He is a weak old man I think that does Translate into it whether or not people are they do they fear him as a as a leader and I know it sad But to say but there is something there is something to be said about having confidence and when you enter a room When you enter a meeting there's a sense of urine and control Joe Biden doesn't know what meaning he just walked into at this point or out of or out of he doesn't know where he is And and so I say that all due respect I think it's time for this country to have a real leader someone that can physically Physically walk into a room and and and and and and and and govern and organize the way they need to do it Absolutely and Donald Trump does that when Donald Trump walks into a room He owns it and everybody knows that and people are very deferential to him Yeah, look oh, I thought we might oh well Oh I like some of the ads there and of course You know, there are always the Trump team always is an amazing job of coming campaign stuff But so you've got the physical presence of president Trump being a leader you got his policies and you got the support I mean folks you're seeing these cutaway cams of probably 10,000 plus thousand people inside here on a Wednesday night in South Florida Meanwhile, there's a GOP debate going on somewhere in the vicinity This man can pack the house no matter what day of the week no matter what time it is I challenge you get show me another Republican candidate right now that can show up on a night like tonight and do 10% of what he has in here. They don't exist. Joe Biden can't do it come on the hairs can't do it or none of them can't none of our presidential contenders can do it and I think they all are Would love to have a turnout like this not only does Donald Trump have turnout like this like there's probably close to 10,000 I would imagine there's about 4,000 seats down here and then when you add in the size Close to 10,000 plus you've got standing room on the side and then there's some open space in the back behind the pressizers But the difference is he doesn't just do an event and get this crowd He does this every week oftentimes multiple times a week and if the packed house at every single event whether it's Whether it's a stadium that holds 10,000 whether it's Theater that holds 5,000 whatever whatever it is he packs it out every single time And he's he's not a rock star in the sense where people are coming to sing songs and party He's a speech and it's largely his speech writers are fantastic. He does a great job with it But it's a speech and we've all heard parts of it many times And yet people continue to come people continue to come that's correct They will continue to come all right. We want to make sure that you follow us on social media as well You can follow me at Brian Glenn TV on x you can follow me on true social at Brian be our ian Make sure you're following right side across all of our social media platforms as well as we get into this 2024 season How about a people an opportunity for people to follow you as well? Yeah, but you can follow me at Christina underscore bob and then If you're interested my book is stealing your vote I was just gonna say if you wonder about the book Yeah, it's available on amazon. It's called stealing your vote the inside story at the 2020 election And what it means for 2024 and it chronicles my time on the trump legal team Post november 3rd 2020 You know And it's amazing that someone earlier today had her book yeah with him And uh that was a perfect timing for him to come out because it is you know It's something that's on everybody's mind right now as we go into 24 We see this amazing crowd here. We we know the support the president has across the country But then all of us in the back of our mind are saying and well did we do enough to secure the election in 2024? So that when america goes to the ballot box next november that we can Trust the fact that we've had an open transparent election Based upon all that you've seen so far. Are we any better off now than we were back last in Yes, we are better off. We're not where I would like us to be a year from now But we are doing better and especially in key states and it's thanks to great patriots like our viewers Who have gotten involved and and really helped to clean up scrub boner rolls no matter what your capabilities are No matter how much time you have you know your resources There is a place for you in cleaning up our local elections because it's something that needs to happen from the bottom up It has to start at the precincts level and get cleaned up all the way up through the federal level Because it's not we've been waiting and clearly it's not getting resolved from the top down So get involved in your precinct get involved in your county. Thanks to the great american patriot michael and del There's a network already available for you cause of america.org Cause ca us e cause of america.org And you can just send them an email contact them and say hey, I live in this county in this state And they will put you in touch with an election integrity organization in your area where you can figure out how to get plugged in Of course, we just came off elections last night In several states around the country just basically localized, you know, but um like a commitment type Single ballot issues We know that in Ohio they kind of pushed pushed further into Abortion as far as a woman's right Which we know that roe v.way does kick that down to the states So that came up the legalization of marijuana recreation marijuana and Ohio that passed over welding and I really think for Sadly There's a couple races that I feel like Republicans did not show up for those races and I hope that As we get closer to 2024 that the In the participation rate The voter turnout for Republicans will be high because president trump often says we've got the policies in place to change this country It the plan is in place. We just need the voters to swap the vote come out and make it impossible For the any discrepancies to prevent you know trump from legitimate you know, Jim legitimately winning the election Well, I think what yesterday proved was that the voter showed for Donald trump and no one else I mean that's effectively what happened. I mean you didn't you didn't have conservative turnout in a lot of these places I mean the Mississippi governor Republican governor won re-election Uh the down ballot in Kentucky was all Republican with the one exception of the governor voting Democrat I thought that's an interesting and interesting race that you know, I don't I don't have any reason one way or another To try to opine on what happened in Kentucky, but it is interesting to me that the entire statewide down ballot Which had about probably five other races on it all went solidly Republican about 60 40 And yet it flipped on the top of the ticket for the governor which He was the incumbent so that's not you know, not unheard of but it's interesting that Republicans would vote For the Democrat at the top of the ticket and then vote Republican all the way down But we did have a win last month with Jeff Landry of Louisiana the attorney general turned governor of Louisiana. So that's a great victory there Yeah, and Jeff Landry's fantastic. He's such a great patriot He's great for the state of Louisiana So I'm really excited to have him in that office So I guess the bottom line is here as we get closer to 2024 and it seems like we're just Now less than a year away. I mean think about this and we said this earlier Um, we're sitting right now on whatever date today is November 7th. I guess or eight We would either We know the results of the election and we're very happy with the results of the election or We're scratching our heads going no wait a minute How did they stop voting in the middle of night and then resume three days later and then all of a sudden we have a different outcome We want to make sure that does not happen Like Christina said earlier Volunteer to be a poll watcher volunteer get involved on the local level That's the where you come in to help be the eyes and ears of the American people because it's you know a lot of times We need some accountability and if they have somebody in the room watching them The shenanigans that we saw in 2020 simply won't happen No, that's exactly right It all comes down to our involvement. It all comes down to Americans getting involved Whether you volunteer whether you work for your county Anyway, you can get involved in it. You're physically limited like you can't leave or you can't do things You can help scrub voter rolls you can do that from home You don't have to even leave your house to help do these types of things So just get plugged in with someone in your area who can help you find something that will work for you And get involved and do it because we need everybody involved right now. There we go.

Oh, yeah, it's gonna It's gonna get wild. I think right at the beginning of the year. I think it's gonna get really really wild I'm looking forward to it. I think it's You know, we're gonna save America. I'm looking forward to getting through that But sign up make sure you know what's going on make sure you know where you're needed Because this isn't all hands-on deck moment So we need we need everybody involved. We need everybody involved in your local elections If elections just don't move you get involved on your school boards get involved in your You know your districts on education Whatever issue moves you get involved in that because we need good Americans involved in that Yeah, get get involved in of course All the things that are happening in the house right now will be there as well If you can always rely on right side to build a stream all the house proceedings all the oversight meetings all the all the speaker votes We were there for about just about everyone of those as well So make sure you tune in for all of that because the house is gonna be so important as we move forward Not only on some of the issues like the impeachment inquiry so we have on on Joe Biden Myorcus. I think it's gonna drop here the next one or two weeks. We'll be on that as well So make sure you stay up to what's going on in the house because it's important that we have a new speaker speaker Johnson I've met I've met him. I've had interaction with him. I've got nothing but good I don't have anything bad to say about speaker Johnson at all But this is what he's got to do right now He's got to lead and take up the agenda that is best for the American people and try to Closes ears to the military industrial complex that once they're just fun fun fun wars You must focus in on doing what the people want Don jr. Said it earlier about what the priority is it's the border. It's the economy It's it's getting out of these global endless wars and I just hope that our speaker listens to the American people and And not the insiders of DC that would love nothing more than to get their claws into him And to make them the next kind of rhino speaker That we do not need at this point in the game when he fighters when he leaders I think Johnson said he's got it in him uh But we just need to make him happy we just need to make it happen. Yeah, and I think you and you mentioned this earlier. I think it's important that he Show commitment to The conservative agenda early on this is not something that he can sit around on and say oh, but we're gonna We're gonna look into an impeachment. Oh, but we're gonna subpoena the Biden's but we're gonna subpoena these other people No, no, no, we're gonna. Doesn't work anymore. You have to do it. I think I think he will do it I think we'll see more action out of him than we thought of McCarty. I think so too But we need to see it. I think the time of having strongly warded letters or you know two-minute clips from your floor speech or some cease-band clip that goes viral and social media Those days of just getting that and walking away. It's over Matter of fact, that's less important your actual vote on things is the most important thing that you can do right now So I'm just making a plea to all those in congress and the senate That the time for kabuki theater with the american people of having this stance of being america first But then you go to vote and it's everybody but america first those Days are over. It's time to put the america people first and i'm telling you if we would have do a rally in some of these Some of these districts of these congresspeople Residin and we were to bring up the topics that they vote against and vote for they would be shocked Because people that you thought was so mega and so america first end up being the exact opposite on their voting record Those days need to change and they are changing I think that is one of the key differences now is that the american public is actually paying attention to how their members are voting We need it to happen more and we need it to happen faster But most americans for a while. I don't think could have even identified who their member of congress is That that is changing and if you're watching and you can't immediately say I know who my member of congress is I know who my state senators are you need to look it up right now Staying for make sure you know who you elected officials are and not just the federal offices the federal level But look it up at a state level because in a lot of ways that's even more important what's happening in your state Who is your state rep and who is your state senator make sure you know that as well Yeah, school boards christina we talked about this if you want to get involved and really change the world The immediate world Check out the school board races check out the city council races check out the races That directly affect your community. Yes, the statewide races are great. Oh that stops. Nope. Thought we might have a walkout here And we don't But those those statewide races. Yeah, those are great, but those local races they control so much And if he don't think there's any kind of election discrepancies on the local level. Oh, no, yeah, that's really good. It's been in prison for 25 years No, the local the county commissioners the county clerks the county recorders The county supervisors those are some of the most important races because those are the people who determine and administer your elections So when there's discrepancies and you have problems It's the county clerks and the recorders who go well, I don't know You know, we're just incompetent. We're not we're not bad. No, no, no like maricopa county is the perfect example Every election that they have had for at least the last three years has been completely run incompetently This most most recent one was yesterday where it is an improvement Only 17% of the polling locations had a problem where they miscommunicated the time that the polls were closing to the people who Ultimately, we're unable to cast a vote again. These are election day voters Conservatives tend to be election day voters. So it this advantages Conservative it always amazes me how these counties that fain and competence Only are incompetent in a way that disproportionately affects Republicans conservatives No backs to the whole point of us Know who your county officials are and know which ones need to be replaced because they have so much dirty And don't assume that because they have an arm behind their name that they're somehow good for us They are not I'm looking at you Arizona. You got a lot of ours in Arizona that really should be these We've got a lot of ours in Texas too and I know I don't want to call some of them out that they aren't in my opinion a true Republican so get involved in your state your local elections your school boards We've had several examples of had people that said hey, we uh we watch right side We hear you talk about getting involved in the city council and guess what I went out and ran for a seat and I want And that's great. We'd love to hear that and we got a couple of people in California that did just that there in the city of Burbank And I thought that was pretty cool, which is gotta be tough and they're conservative So it that's gonna be a tough place to play you know We often talk about you know California and of course I was with the president in California for the California GOP and I didn't notice that the huge support that lined the streets everywhere we went huge support I am not completely convinced that California is beyond saving. I think California There is a lot of conservatives in California for all you guys watch this right now in the west goes keep Fighting do not leave the state and come to Texas. I don't want them to leave. I want them to stay and fight now Obviously if it's economic reasons you're like run. I'm not making it here. I have to leave. I God bless you I want you to leave to save your your family and your and your livelihood But we need fighters we need fighters in California right now And if everyone leaves and goes to red states then where we abandon the state of California So speaking to my brothers and citrus in California Keep fighting. I do think it's possible to say without a doubt And you know Mike Lindell often talks about California how it was it's more conservative than what then we think it really is it really is I think they've got a lot of problems with their elections in California There are liberals there. I'm not trying to pretend to like California is a conservative state Oh, here we go. Is that the motorcade? Well, let's see I think let's step aside. We might better get a little bit of motorcade shots there. I thought he was here already But that did look like a motorcade motorcade probably pulling up Where we're not going to get From this vantage point we may not get a direct shot But obviously these people They're very excited. They're reacting to something they're seeing right now. They're seeing it. They're seeing it This is always an exciting moment. Yes It is and and look at everyone's got their phones out. They're standing on their chairs Hoping to catch a glimpse of when he exits his vehicle I just love how packed this place is on a Wednesday night And we couldn't have gotten better weather now that the sun has gone down Yeah, now that the sun has gone down this is great for this evening. It's perfect But you know what I think this is what we're going to see on the way out and the reason why Christina is America is broken And they want someone To fix the policies You know, I'm not gonna you know, I'm not talking biblical terms. We know that you know gods in control I'm talking about our government right our our policies They need someone that is going to fix that and they know that president Trump Based upon past experiences and how really is to the American people? I mean we often said show me another Political elected figure that can do this and have this much support I have not seen it in my lifetime. No, this is really really incredible And it happens time and time again at every single location People are so excited to see him. They're fired up. It's just a sea of mega hats and red t-shirts We now there's the chanting we is that we love We love Trump Or we want Trump I couldn't tell Let's go ahead listen into this Him a following In the ads he says There's nothing wrong with American foreign policy the little backbone law cure And he said We have no business spending ourselves broke in the Middle East Protecting ships that are not ours and oil that we don't need runglings in the Trump camp Why as far as the presidency? Somebody has to help this country and if they don't the country and the world are in big trouble Because within a short period of time as sure as we're sitting here There's not going to be a country and there's not going to be a world. I have no intention of running for president And if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally Together we will determine the course of America and the world For many many years to come For too long a small group in our nation's capital As reek the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost That all changes Starting right here and right now Because this moment is your moment it belongs to you The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer I'm leading in five of the six most important battlegrounds state hiding continues to trail Donald Trump Our latest polling out of Iowa also shows for lepais and Trump is a 30 point Over his years rival the Republican primaries over Donald Trump basically has this nomination locked up Everyone is listening to you now I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down My fellow Americans our movement is far from over in fact our fight has only just begun Ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen welcome to hi alia flarda for president Donald J. Trumps make America great again rally Please put your hands together and welcome to the stage the former White House press secretary and current governor of Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders super I hit the sand, I hit the snow, I clap to the back, you sound, that news from the news, that's kept me in the round again, good evening Trump country. You know I've spent a lot of time at Trump rallies and I gotta say this is one of the best, because our country has never needed Donald Trump more than we do right now. And I love you too. I was going to Trump rallies way back in 2016 when I first worked on the president's campaign. Eight years later it is just as exciting as when he came down that beautiful golden escalator the very first time. I know I'm upsetting a lot of Democrats by being here tonight because they like to pretend that they are the party of women. They don't like that the very first woman to ever serve as governor of Arkansas is a proud conservative Republican. And my message to them is very simple, you cannot be the party of women if you cannot tell us what a woman is. The truth is it's not even a question anymore between right and left. It is normal versus crazy and the left is doubling down on crazy. We've got out of control inflation, violent crime, an open border, a rising China, Biden and the left have failed over and over again and they know it and you know it and it is time for a change. That is why tonight I am so proud to endorse my former boss, my friend and everybody's favorite president Donald J Trump. Think back to four years ago our economy was booming gas was cheap homes were affordable people were thriving. President Trump put conservatives on the Supreme Court. He cut taxes and he rolled back Obama's big government regulations. He made us energy independent. He cut America first trade deals. Donald Trump was building the wall and rebuilding our military. President Trump was the first president in my lifetime to take a hard line against China and I'm proud to be the first governor in the country to ever kick China off our farmland and out of our state. Under President Trump, ISIS was destroyed. The cartels were on the run. China was weakened. Our ran was isolated. Our enemies actually feared us and our people loved us. President Trump made us great and I know that he will do it again. That is because he is not afraid to be an outsider, a change agent, a disruptor. He put America first, the first president in a long time to do exactly what he said he was going to do. He is the complete and total opposite of Joe Biden, the corrupt Washington insider. I know that a lot of people make complaining that President Trump was too loud, too disruptive and sometimes even a little too direct. But to me, that is the very best thing about this president. He tells it like it is. He is not afraid to do it. President Trump is not afraid to make waves and get the job done, even if it is politically incorrect. And you know what? I take a lot of tweets right now, especially since I'm no longer the White House press secretary. Out of over, inflation, open borders and world war three. When I worked under President Trump in the White House, I saw firsthand a side to him that a lot of people didn't. A great boss, a mentor and an outstanding father. When I was press secretary, I had to endure some of the most nasty, malicious attacks from the left and the media. They attacked my appearance, my character, even my fitness as a mother. We love you! Thank you. But I will never forget the time that President Trump pulled me aside, looked me straight in the eye and said, Sarah, you're tough, you're beautiful and you're good at your job. That's why they attack you. Never let them get you down. Then in true Trump fashion, he popped me on the shoulder, he said, okay, now get back to work. It was exactly what I needed to hear. Again and again and again, as a working mom, as a woman, President Trump not only empowered me, he defended me when I needed it most. That's the man I know and that's exactly the kind of leader we need back in the White House. During my two and a half years serving under the President, I traveled on every single one of his foreign trips. We'll give him a minute. We'll stay here all night for President Trump. We'll work for him! The most unforgettable trip we ever took was December 25th, 2018. It was Christmas day and my husband Brian and I had just cleaned up wrapping paper that was shoved in literally every corner of our house. When I had to walk out on my own family's Christmas, I couldn't tell them the place that I was going because the place I was traveling to was so dangerous, they didn't want anybody in the world to know that the President would be on the ground even for a few hours. Yet we have men and women living, serving, sacrificing every single day in that exact location. We boarded Air Force One in complete and total darkness. There were no lights on the plane, no lights on the runway, our phones and computer shut down, we were going totally off the grid. In 12 hours later, in the pitch black of night, we landed in more torn Western Iraq. Again, no lights on the plane, no lights on the runway. The only light you could see was coming from about a mile away. The reason there was light in that one location is because there were hundreds of troops packed into a dining hall, gathered thinking they were having dinner with senior military leadership from around the region. They had absolutely no idea that the President and First Lady were about to walk into that room. And when they did, it was a sight and a sound and a scene that I hope I never forget. That room absolutely erupted. Many women from every race, religion, region and political party stood up and started chanting. Over and over and over again, USA, USA, USA. That was the kind of patriotism President Trump brought back to our country. And he's going to bring it back again. One of the young soldiers yelled from the back of the room, Mr. President, I re-enlisted in the military because of you. And without missing a beat, the President said in Sun, I am here because of you. As the President made his way around the room that same young soldier came up to me and said, Sarah, you have a tough job. I told him what I do is nothing. You take bombs and bullets. That is a tough job. Then the soldier reached up and he pulled the brave rifles patch that he wore on his shoulder. He placed it into my hand. He said, Sarah, we are in this together. I couldn't say anything. I just reached up and hugged him and thanked him for being the hero that he is that helps keep us free. As we sit here tonight, I am thinking of people like that young soldier. They fight every day to keep us free and they deserve a leader at home who has their back like they have ours. But today, our country is under attack from the outside and from within. And let me be clear, Joe Biden is not up for the job. His party has gone completely crazy and we need President Trump to step in and help bring our country back. We need him to finish what he started eight years ago. We need him to make America great again. This is our movement. This is our moment. This is our time and this is our President. Please help me welcome everyone's favorite President Donald J. Trump. And I'm proud to be an American where it means I know my dream. And I won't forget the men who died will give that life to me and I might stand up next to you when it hit her still today. Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land. God lift the USA. From the laser Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee across the plains. The USA and the Detroit down into Houston. And New York to the air. Where there's pride in every American heart and it's time we stand and say. I'm proud to be an American where it means I know my dream. And I won't forget the men who died will give that life to me and I might stand up next to you and it been her still today. Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land. God lift the USA. And I'm proud to be an American where it means I know my dream. And I won't forget the men who died will give that life to me and I might stand up next to you and it been her still today. Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land. God lift the USA. Well I want to thank you very much and Sarah thank you for the wonderful endorsement and Arkansas in very good hands. It's a great place. It's a great state. Florida, great state. We love to be with you. And I didn't have to come too far. I'm thrilled to be here in the heart of Miami with thousands of proud, hardworking, God-fearing American patriots. That's what you are. Just think of it seven years ago tonight on November 8th 2016 the American people delivered the greatest election victory probably that the world has ever seen probably so. The only one that's going to be more important is the one that's coming up in one year from now. It's going to be more important. On that magnificent day you didn't just crush the dreams of a person that we used to call crooked Hillary Clinton, Winnell color that anymore call a beautiful Hillary. Because we use the word crooked for the president because he's crooked as you get. You stood up and smashed the grip of the globalist, the war mongers, the open borders lobby, the outsourcers and all of the liars and leeches who had been sucking the life and blood right out of our country for years and years. And for four great years we dealt the radical F. Maniacs and special interests, one historic defeat after another because we put America first. It's very simple. They weren't too happy about it either were they. Every day since our two thousand sixteen victory that was some year the sick political class we defeated has been trying to scratch and claw their way back into total control over our lives they are working so hard. It's actually all they're good at they're bad at policy they're bad at everything but they're only good at that and they're really great at cheating in elections but we're not going to let that happen. They put you me my family and our country through hell but in the end they will fail and we will win because we will never stop fighting to save the America we love. Crookets Joe Biden and the radical F. Democrats are turning the United States into communist Cuba and you know because we have a lot of great Cubans here. We have some great Cubans here and nobody ever did more for Americans who love Cuba than a gentleman named Donald J. Trump when he was president. We're going to be taking it over very quickly and then they blew it. We were Trump. What they've done is so terrible in the last three years with respect to Cuba we had it just where we wanted it it was all set to go and they blew it they blew it so badly. Just like the Cuban regime the Biden regime is trying to put their political opponents in jail shutting down free speech taking bribes and kickbacks to enrich themselves and their very spoiled children my children are so spoiled are they huh? They've been cheating in elections using the fake news media to cover up their colossal incompetence and stupidity what they've done to our country nobody can even believe it. And using the fear taxics of a police state because that's what we become to persecute Christians and especially Catholics what's going on with Catholics. There are after Catholics one of Catholics then there after Catholics aren't they any Catholic or Christian that votes for a Democrat I have to say your fools if you do that your fools. That's what they're doing is unthinkable but we're here tonight to declare that crooked Joe Biden's banana republic ends on November 5th 2024. Good ends. As you know Biden and the radical left Democrats claim to be defending democracies always talking about democracy doesn't know what the word means again to find it. Joe what is maguestent for Joe tell me I don't know I don't know well ask him that during an debate what is maguestent for I don't know but like power hungry regimes all over the world just because they put the word democratic in their name does not make it true. The radical left Democrat communists are against voter ID therefore open borders how about that open borders where criminals come in from all over the world. Therefore massive censorship and blacklisting therefore shredding the Constitution gutting the rule of law and threatening their political opponents with violence and ruin. Remember we are not the ones endangering American democracy we are the ones saving American democracy we're saving it from these very terrible people. If you don't want to let the communists destroy America like they destroyed Cuba Venezuela Nicaragua and so many other countries you need to send a message by voting crooked Joe Biden and all of his friends the people that are actually really running our country and every last Democrat get them the hell out of office we have to get them out. Because this race is not just about beating crooked Joe it's about defeating the entire rotten corrupt and tyrannical establishment right now that you have in Washington DC nobody thought would see this. This election will decide whether power in America belongs to them forever or whether it belongs to you the men and women who make this country great who make this country run. The 2020-24 is our final battle stand with me in the fight we will finish the job that we started so brilliantly seven years ago we never had a country like we had just three years ago the job we did we did things that nobody thought were possible. With your vote we are going to win the Florida primary for a third straight time. We are going to win this wonderful state in a landslide like we have done right from the beginning. Remember you know you got to remember we got 1.2 million more votes than Rhonda sanctimonies you know that right everyone says really did so well he did well because I endorsed him that's the only reason he was he was gone but we got 1.2 million more votes and Rhonda sanctus says Zenbius is the only way to win. The other day ladies and gentlemen governor Rhonda sanctus that's called good branding isn't it we do a good job and we are going to make America great again greater than ever before that's what's going to happen. And job number one is to make America safe again for four straight years under the Trump administration I kept America safe I kept Israel safe I kept Ukraine safe and I kept the world safe Israel Ukraine would have never happened under the Trump administration there was no chance it would have happened. Those two events alone would have never happened inflation would have never happened would have never happened was caused by stupid people on energy policy but we get it back really fast before it took office there was a terrorist attack seemingly every week people were getting massacred left and right including the pulse nightclub murders in Orlando you remember that how horrible that was with me in the White House we stopped it called nothing happened for four years nothing happened. I completely obliterated the ISIS territorial caliphate they said that couldn't be done. And I terminated its founder and leader who was trying to rebuild it again al-Baghdaddi and we also ended the life of the world's top terrorist ever probably. Kasim Soleimani the father of the roadside bomb when you see young men and women on the streets where they have no legs their arms are wiped out their face everything he was the one 94% of it was all done by Soleimani he's no longer with us. And here in the United States I implemented a strong powerful really incredible travel ban they called the Trump travel ban and I said that's okay if you want to do that to keep radical Islam terrorists out of our country and we did. When countries were sending their young strong people that had bad intentions we didn't let them do it and the countries paid hell for it but we kept it and we had no problems and then you look at what's been taking place now and you look at the millions and millions of people that are coming into our country totally unchecked nobody knows who they are. But under the crooked Joe Biden we were weak and soft and in danger like never before and that continues and you know we have an election that's coming up very quickly but one years a long time the destruction that they've done to our country one year seems like it's quick but it's not it's a long time for them to continue because we're close to having no country at all and we're also close to being in World War III a war that you've never even conceived or thought about. But we're very close you know they have a hat I saw it the other day it said Trump was right about everything and I said well that's a big statement and then you think about it and I sort of was right about everything Russia Russia Russia hoax the whole thing our country is never seen the likes of what you witnessed in America last weekend with the menacing mobs of Komas supporters chanting their G-Hod slogans and the streets of our city. In Washington DC pro G-Hodest Demonstrators climbed up the fence in front of the White House excuse me that I built I built it you know the fence wasn't too good the one that they had up there was falling apart and we built a titanium it's the strongest stuff and they damaged the fence and they damaged police vehicles they desecrated statues have been franked and other great heroes of our country and they shatted Hala Akbar while calling the barbaric Hamas terrorists martyrs they were saying martyrs in times like these you can't afford to have a president who wants to be politically correct we have to do things properly. We cannot have an administration that takes foreign policy advice from Ilhan Omar or Rashida Teli can't do that. AOC plus three right AOC plus three but that's a movement that's growing on day one we will restore the Trump travel ban on entry from terror play countries and we will implement strict vetting and ideological screening for all new entrance into our country we don't do that at all now anybody can come in anybody can come in when people want to go and take the test where do I learn to take the test people say to them you don't have to take any test just go to the southern border and walk in you don't have to bother with us you know we had a good strong policy we wanted people to come to our country but we wanted them to come in legally legally. If you hate America if you want to abolish Israel if you sympathize with jihadists then we don't want you in our country and we are not going to let you come into our country. To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro jihadist protests and became very violent and started destroying our capital in many other places we put you in notice come 2025 we will find you and we will deport you. You know during my term we had a little bit of a problem with people coming into Washington and want to knock down all of our statues to our great heroes in many cases great heroes but these were beautiful works of art and they represented Washington they represented our history and they came in and they started getting more and more than all of a sudden they started talking about taking down Lincoln and taking down our country. George Washington and Jefferson they went to knock down the Jefferson memorial little things like that and I was able to find an old law because only old laws are tough our current laws a week their week their for a week country their for people that don't want to be told what to do properly and we found this old law and I immediately had a press conference I signed it and I enacted it first time in almost a hundred years and it said it was a great deal. I have used so much as touch one of our statues or memorials you go to jail for ten years with no probation no anything you go for ten years and you will remember that and as soon as I signed it everybody ran away it was the end we had no problem I will never forget we signed it there were people on top of one of the most beautiful statues in Washington and they had ropes you know what I am talking about and they were all set to do something and they heard about this and they got off that thing so fast you wouldn't believe and they all left we ended the problem I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses which have been infested with radicalism like never before college campuses one day one I will stop the invasion of our southern border we will stop it one point think of this one point five million people in my opinion are coming in every two months I think the numbers going to end up being not three million people not five not seven not ten that you hear the real number you know talking about Godaways you know the Godaways are many many times the ones they catch I think the number is going to be more than 15 million people which is larger the New York state thank you under Biden the United States has become the dumping ground of the world inmates are being emptied out of their prisons insane asylum and mental institutions and they're pouring into the United States think of it empty insane asylum that's a bad word my people say please don't use those words sir why because it's so nasty well that's true now an insane asylum is silence of lambs and anybody ever hear of Hannibal Lecter he was a nice fellow but that's what's coming into our country right now and mental institutions which is a number of degrees below that and prisons and jails is a little difference and they're coming in at levels never seen before probably never seen before at any country there's never been anything like this our country is being invaded this is an invasion it's an invasion a few months ago right here in Florida a sadistic illegal alien in Lee County was charged with kidnapping a woman from a nightclub drag in her into the woods beating her raping her and leaving her with what we're called bone chilling injuries so bad that she's still trying to recover and she's still very close to death in Alabama a previously deported illegal alien was charged was savagely murdering just absolutely murdering a 34 year old woman in her 14 year old son before dismembering their bodies while holding captive the woman's 12 year old daughter who watched this is the kind of monstrosity you'd expect from terrorists in the Middle East but it's happening right here because of crooked Joe Biden right here Florida in our country all over our country one day one I will terminate every open borders policy of the Biden administration and we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history so sad we even have to talk about this wouldn't it be great if we could just talk about fixing our country making a great without having to do all this but we have no choice we have bad people terrorists at levels that nobody's ever seen I sort chart the other day on one of the networks one of the fake news networks they're all fake news now they're all fake they're all fake news they put commercials on that is so bad even when they're with you and then they put commercials on that are so bad and ridiculous but I sort chart that in 2019 there were no terrorists coming in at zero and I said it must be wrong to campy but they had actually zero and then the following year they had many many many once Biden took over the terrorists have flooded into our country and bad things are happening when you see from China thousands and thousands of young strong men coming into our country what's that all about when you see from the Middle East all over the Middle East young strong men not to insult women but young strong men are flooding our country they've got something in mind there's something in mind and in many cases these are the same people that did the attack on Israel just a few weeks ago these are the same people and for any radical left charity non-profit or so-called aid organization supporting the caravans the name I came up with and by the way right now you have the largest caravan that anybody has ever seen walking through Mexico and making its way into your country it's a disgrace we will prosecute them for their participation in human trafficking child smuggling and every other crime that we can find I will also use Title 42 to end the child trafficking crisis by returning all traffic children to their families in their home countries immediately back to their parents where they were stolen from their parents you saw the movie freedom they were stolen from their parents it's no wonder Crook or Joe Biden in the far left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary they're weaponizing law enforcement for high-level election interference that's what it is they want to damage our name and my name so we don't quit yeah we don't quite get over that little threshold that we have to but right now our numbers are higher than they've ever been you see that the poll numbers we're beating them so badly in the polls you probably saw last week the New York Times no big fan of mine I would say and the Santa Paul very respected of the general election we are leading Crook or Joe Biden in almost all of the swing states in Pennsylvania we're up four and Michigan we're up five in Arizona we're up five in Georgia we're up six in Nevada we're up 11 points and nationally we're up at numbers that frankly nobody's nobody's seen before nobody is seen it before and I don't think I've changed that much but when you look at the difference between what we did the success that we had just three years ago with the energy independence and even dominance all of the things that we had and then you look at what's happening right now it's a it's a big contrast we're proud to see that these great numbers are led by surging support from Hispanic Americans African Americans and young people how about that in the primary we're leading the field with an average of 61 percent for Trump and you have about what seven or eight candidates left I think they're at a debate tonight nobody's talking about it everybody's watching so it's 61 percent for your favorite president me and 10 percent for Ronda sanctimonious and seven percent for Bird Brain you know bird I will never run against him he's a great president I will never ever run against him said bird brain I will not run against him he was one of the greatest presidents in the history of our country and then about three months later she goes I've decided to run this this is the craziest business politic they said to me at one point who's worse business people or politicians and I said because this was very early and I said definitely business people are worse then after about three or four months of Russia Russia Russia pencil neck Adam Schiff he's got the smallest neck I've ever seen it's like it's like the size of a finger I don't know it holds up his head which is oversized I don't know how it holds it up it's like America it's an engineering model Adam Adam Schiffty ship but after dealing with Pelosi who's crazy by the way she's nuts after dealing with all of these people that I had to deal with with the Russia Russia Russia hoax every hoax that you could imagine I say I called up the people that I said I think business the worst because that was very early that was like my first week I said that and it's that I'm changing my mind the worst people the worst by far are politicians they have far more deceptive their liars they're much more disloyal so I give the business people I will tell you you're much nicer much kinder and much softer than politicians our nation is in very serious trouble and it's time for the Republican establishment to stop wasting time and resources trying to push weak and ineffective rhinos and never trumpers that nobody wants and nobody's going to vote for I watch these guys coming in I had this thing and I was watching these guys did not watchable you know the last debate was the lowest rated debate in the history of politics so so therefore do you think we did the right thing by not participate somebody said oh some one of those dumber ones he doesn't have the courage to stand up well listen I'm standing in front of tens of thousands of people right now and it's on television that's a hell of a lot harder to do than a debate that's a hell of a lot harder now I would say standing up here in this beautiful podium you know a podium where these stairs are not obvious enough Biden could never get off now but think of it here's a guy can't find who will figure out a way to get off the stage with about five sets of stairs they got one here I got one there I have one there I have one here and you could even jump off the front of you after he can't figure so he can't find out how to get off the stage and he would also by the way here for the times he falls and they and listen so he can't get off the stage he can't put two sentences together and he's in charge of our nuclear talks this is the closest we've ever been to world war three this is the closest and I hope that one's wrong and that's not a prediction because I would never make that prediction it's too horrible a thing to say but we have never been closer to world war three and only for one reason we have incompetent people talking on our behalf you know when you deal with China President Xi and North Korea Kim Jong-un and Russia Putin you deal with all these people the press hates when I say they're smart he said they were smart well what am I supposed to say there's stupid people Kim Jong-un leads 1.4 billion people and there's no doubt about who the boss is and they want me to say he's not an intelligent man they get very personal when I say that because they're fake news that's why they do that they're fake they're fake people and they're hurting our country very badly you know when that poll came out I watched a certain anchor on ABC who truly doesn't have it how they pick this guy's an anchor and he was almost crying when he saw the numbers in the New York Times book is it has us up by 10 11 points and beating Biden everywhere with women with everything women I'm finally doing so I always felt I did well with women because women want security women want some kind of women I'm winning with young people I thought I do well with young people look at the people here they're all young people they're all young and beautiful they're young people look at that so we're doing well with every category and this guy was up on ABC and he was said do you know what this means you know yeah it means we're gonna have strong borders great education you're gonna be able to buy a house we're gonna have interest rates come down we're gonna have a great military we're gonna have safety and security it means everything it means we're gonna have a country because you're not gonna have a country left if we don't win this election you're not gonna have a country left I'm telling you this country's going to hell it's going to hell and you know it and we know it and I hate to say it because it's a very negative thought I would say look at the front row Joe's we use stand up these people they follow me all over the place they're the greatest but you know what they love our country how many of how many now tell me 32 that's nothing compared to so 65 76 98 they are great they love our country and they must be doing very well because they travel all over the place you guys you gotta be making a lot of money right huh well we love you too and everybody here loves you too because you know what you love our country and that's what we're well the radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election of 2020 and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024 every time the radical left Democrats Marxist communist and fascist indict me they indicted me can you believe my father and mother are looking down son how did that happen we're so proud of you son how did that happen that wasn't a word that was in but this is a political indictment this is a Biden indictment even that stupid trial going on in New York which has been totally discredited everybody's been discredited that's all comes out of the White House that's to discourage people from voting that's to hurt us the only difference is we have a big voice we're a very big voice is the greatest movement in the history of politics and we have a great voice and we're not going to let them get away with it but every time I'm indicted I consider it a great badge of honor because I'm being indicted for you thanks a lot everybody I appreciate I'm being indicted for you and never forget our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never ever ever let them take away your freedom I won't let it happen they want to silence me because I will never let them silence you I will never let them and in the end they're not after me they're after you I just happen to be standing in their way and that's true that's true you know it is true though when you look at these crowds it's crazy if we had one of these candidates to pick the best one whoever that is I don't know that you have a best one of them said last week that on the stage that president trump is the greatest president in many generations I sort of like him you know who that is I sort of I mean how can I dislike him he's so nice a lot of people say that why are you running well he said I'm a younger version and it's okay to say but we want the older version right but that's okay to say and you know you got to remember Biden's not too old that's not his problem he's too incompetent he's not all so many people I know a man that fought all his life to make money and he became a billionaire from 80 to 90 from 80 years old to 90 he made all of his money became a very rich man fought his whole life and he became he made all of his money some of the greatest leaders in history have been way over 80 some of the people I know some of the smartest people I have one of them here tonight he's one of the most incredible business men in the world and I won't say he's over 80 but let's say he's right around that I want to insult him the great ike pro mutter he's right over here is one of the greatest business men he owned marvel he sold it to Disney he's not too happy with Disney going woke I will tell you but he's one of the greatest business men and he is here with Laurie we have some incredible business men and business women with us tonight and some of them are over 80 years old and they're just a shop I would say a couple of them are sharper now than they were 15 years ago I don't remember them being that short but we have people and he's not you know they like to say that they like to say that because I think you know they're trying to say well truck maybe isn't that far behind I think I'm really far behind I think I'm really way far but his problem is not age they keep saying that his problem is that he's grossly incompetent and by the way 25 years ago he was incompetent too he had the worst foreign policy judgment of any human being and the secretary of state senate the secretary of the fence senate we're pleased to be joined tonight by some really incredible people the woman who ran a fantastic race for governor of Arizona and they said come on Tuesday come you know Republicans rightfully they like to come on Tuesday to vote they don't like sending out their ballots into the open atmosphere and maybe you never seeing them again that happens but she really did it ran a great campaign and on Tuesday they had lines that were miles long in Arizona miles and it was and it was hot and unfortunately over 50% of the machines and the Republican areas only didn't work so they always find something that's why they asked me the first question they asked me sir how do you take it how do you do it how do you wake up in the morning how do you go through it they're after you like nobody's ever been after you before they're persecuting you I said that's okay I do it because I love it because we're doing something so great it's history we're saving our country it doesn't bother me at all it doesn't bother me at all and the second question I get the second question I get is will they do it again sir and you know what they mean will they do it again will they cheat again because they cheated like a bunch of dogs will they do it again and we have the best everything they're going to try look that's all you can't win elections when you say open borders bad education high interest rates high taxes tremendously big and impossible regulations week on every nation not respected by anybody the United States right now is a laughing stock all over the world they don't they don't respect our president they respected me they don't respect our president they don't respect anything about us and then you're supposed to win an election they win their elections by cheating that's what they do that's the only way you can't win an election with open borders and I don't even care if they're liberal as hell when you see people pouring in from these mental institutions and from jails from Africa from Asia from all over Europe and from South America it's not just South America who the hell is going to vote they cheat like hell and I will say it I've been indicted for saying it and yet they used to say that about me in 2016 the election was rigged the election was stolen we're going to put up a slate of electors against Trump you know who did that Thomas Jefferson did it many years ago and it's been done many times but in 2016 they even tried to get me on Alabama and I wanted by like 45 points they said he cheated on Alabama I said I wanted by 45 points I must have cheated by a lot it's a great state with incredible people but they did the same thing when you look at Maxine Waters watch the way she talked look at to leave today what she said the mouth of horrible things she said look at some of the things that they say they want you to walk into that restaurant and knock the hell out of them they said right all of the horrible things they said in far worse than that and nothing happens but if we say peacefully and patriatically oh that's so threatening these people are sick they're sick and we're not going to let them get away with it we're not going to let it happen and it happened once it's not going to happen twice you know we did much better the second time than we did the first I say it proudly we did much better the second time you know we won in 2016 and then we got millions and millions of more votes a second time never happened to a president usually a president will if they win they'll win with less votes and they got the first time because people get bored you know who he's a boring guy I don't think I'm too boring but he's a boring guy I got the largest number of votes ever gotten by a city president and I got the biggest increase there's never been so I went from 63 million to I believe over 75 million and that's been recorded by them not by me how about the real number okay how about the real number so we got like 12 million more votes and the most before that was a couple of million votes Obama Barack Hussein Obama has anyone ever heard of him Barack Hussein remember Rush Limbaugh the great Rush Limbaugh gave him the presidential medal of freedom Rush remember he used to go Barack Hussein Obama Barack Hussein Obama but Obama got less votes the second time by a lot I mean he was against the candidate that didn't do too well but he got he got far less votes and most presidents too but some get a little bit more but they get this much more we got like millions and millions and millions and more votes I was told that if we get 63 million the original number we can't lose so we got millions and more votes and that and they stole the election but we're not going to let it happen again we're not going to let it we're going to be vigilant we're going to be there you know I went home I did like six or seven rallies twice on the last couple of days I did rallies I started off in 82 degree weather and by the time I finished at two o'clock in the morning the weather was about seven degrees below zero that's called them that's called I would say pneumonia time right that was like you start off wearing almost a bathing suit and you end up wearing fur coats in the same day pneumonia but I went home and I did my job I think I thought we did great and we had such great turnout we had crowds like this we had such great turnout and after the turnout all of the things that happened all of that great turnout was so incredible and I thought I did my job because I went home to watch it on television and I love seeing and at nine o'clock it was over ten o'clock it was really over and then bad singers we have found some additional votes oh well that's here we go then at three o'clock in the morning we saw some things happen and then we watched it we watched it be stolen we watched it be stolen very serious very serious thing and again we can't have a country if we don't have borders and if we don't have elections if we don't have fair elections we can't have we can't have a successful we can't have a successful we can't have but Carrie Lake ran and she did great she did phenomenally it was a real it was a part of our movement but it was a whole big part of the movement in a great place and they got there and they actually had to take her offline send up Carrie please they had to take her offline because it's Arizona and the weather is warm to put it mildly and she was standing online and the police came they said I'm sorry man you could be waiting for hours would like to take you to another area to vote they took her to a Democrat area she walked in voted and left the lines were miles long and many of those people had to leave they had to leave because you know it's hot they have literally games for their kids they have doctor appointments they have to leave no matter how much they love her or me they had to leave and she lost a very very close race and went to court and normally a judge would say oh wow you know it's an interesting thing with judges and I have a lot of respect for a lot of judges but an Obama let's say Obama because let's not even talk about Biden yet but an Obama judge will say you know I'm an Obama judge and I'm proud of it and I don't care what the merits of this case you're in deep trouble you it's hard to win whereas the Republican judge a lot of them not all of them have some that and we just want fairness but a Republican judge will say oh I want to show my fairness so what I'll do is I'll screw the Republican and everyone will think I'm fair it's so different it's so different but she had a situation where she had a judge and judges that I mean how obvious could that be a large percentage of the machines just didn't work and people had to leave by the thousands they left and she lost a very close election and the court just didn't want to hear it and it's a shame but she's a great person now she's running for the Senate and I think I think she's going to do great and I saw a poll where you're leading today it's going to be maybe a three-party race a three-person race and she's leading also ambassador Carlos Trujillo Carlos were you Carlos Trujillo who's been a tremendous support in Miami Dade County Commissioner Kevin Cabrera where is Kevin he's around here he's around here someplace I

just came across also webser Barnaby Jessica Baker Kevin steel and Mike Beltran are here with us and they endorsed and I want to thank them a woman that opened a television show and got 28 million

used to say if I said that this is a terrible thing when he says it is okay he wanted to take me to the back of the board if I went like this he'd fall down but this guy is so tough and he grew up in the streets of Miami the streets they're really the mean streets one of the greatest fighters in the history of the UFC a champ a great guy I promised him I wouldn't tell him what a great person he is

had nobody killed for 18 months in Afghanistan I spoke to the head of the Taliban depressed when crazy when they're here I spoke to them over the phone Abdul I said Abdul don't do it ever again no more you kill he killed a lot of people in the Biden and Obama regime and I called them I said no we don't do it we'll hit you so hard you're not gonna believe how hard we're gonna hit you for 18 months we had nobody killed not one soldier was even shot at which was shocking and we would have pulled out with dignity and strength but instead of that they moved the soldiers you could ask a young child should you take the soldiers out first or last and he would say oh I think take them out last but we took them out first because we had stupid people running things the mother-in-law of fallen sergeant Nicole G. Christie Shambling wherever Christie might be Christie and Christie I've gotten to know the whole group thank you Christie nice to see you great person I got to know all of them and they called me

look we have to get back it's not like making the speech or it's we have to get back we have to bring sanity you know a lot of people say who you can serve not a question being conservative what people with common sense because it's really about common sense it's not about your conservative and your this but what people that want to see borders and we want to see education we want to see low taxes these people you're going to have a tax increase of four times more than you're paying right now with these maniacs I've always said you know you have to lower taxes if you're going to be a politician this is the only group they can raise taxes and they make it sound like it's a good thing it's a bad thing and you know we gave you the largest tax decrease in history largest tax cut in history and we were going to do something we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation more than Saudi Arabia more than Russia we were going to drill baby drill and we were going to sell the oil to Europe and Asia all over the place we had them all lined up and we were going to pay off our 34 trillion dollars that we were going to lower your taxes still further and these stupid idiots come in and they say oh we don't want to do that but not least of all we have a man who I was very proud to endorse I heard about him I got to know him he's actually one of the best mayors in the country as far as I'm concerned but I gave him an endorsement and it went on to a tremendous victory highly a mayor Steve Bovo you know Steve and Steve could you come up he said he wanted to say

honored that you're here in the city of Halea and I told you how honored we were that we were going to do right by you because you've always kept your promise to the residents of this great nation and we're appreciative and I will be asking next week the city council of Halea some of the members of the city council are here with us today our council president is here our other council members are here and I will be asking them next week to to be able to authorize and board affirmatively as we name a street after you Donald Trump wait yes thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you oh that's an honor great honor I did not know that thank you very much and he's a great mayor and a great council you have so thank you all very much appreciate it this is more than a campaign what we've been doing for now seven years eight years when you added all up and we started this is a movement the likes of which this world has never seen before the world has never seen a movement like this together we appointed nearly 300 federal judges a record and three great Supreme Court justices we took on communist China like no administration history bringing hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into our treasury when no other president had gotten them to pay us even ten cents nobody asked them for anything they said they were third world country they're a developing nation well so what we were developing nation they were given so much I ended the NAFTA disaster worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with a brand new USMCA the best trade deal ever made that's United States Canada and Mexico I canceled Barack Hussein Obama's deal with the Cuban dictatorship and reimposed tough sanctions on the regime and they were ready to do anything that our great Cuban Americans wanted but then they came in and they just canceled everything and they put us back in the same weak position we've always been in they were ready to do anything for our Cuban Americans and for me I kept my promise recognized Israel's eternal capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem no other president they went through many many presidents I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and I think most importantly but they did nothing with it I withdrew from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal but they did nothing with it under president Trump we had peace through strength all over the world I'm the only candidate who can make this promise to you that I will prevent World War 3 you're going to have World War 3 if we're not careful I was very honored a very great head of a country Victor Orban hungry very powerful he fronts on both Russia and Ukraine knows him both very well I told me a lot of things great guy but they asked him about two weeks ago what should Biden do what should he do because the world is blowing up the world the United States everything's blowing up he said I have a very simple as you know he's one of the toughest smartest leaders of a country very tough he didn't allow anybody into the country he said no my country is for Hungarians he didn't want people blowing up a shopping center as he said if you don't mind but he said by countries for Hungarians but he said to the interviewer here's what Biden has to do resigned from office let Trump take over again and you will have peace because everybody respected him or feared him China Russia North Korea everybody and I was very honored by that state but now I think they did they respected me and they respected our country and we didn't have what's going the whole world is going crazy now and he actually said we're not talking just the United States the United States has such power if it wants to use it but you know what with every day we're losing our power because we're losing our wealth we're losing our strength we're losing our spirit we're losing our power with every day that goes by and there'll be a time when we don't have any power there'll be a time when we just if if things keep going like this there's going to be a time very quickly it's almost probably here where we no longer have any power to help the world and help a lot of other a lot of great people that are dying we have people dying all over the world right now nobody would have died in Ukraine nobody would have died in Russia lost many many soldiers nobody would have died nobody would have died nobody in Israel the attack would have never taken place would have never taken place to protect our citizens from foreign threats I will build state-of-the-art missile defend shields and the Florida space industry will be a center of the action so you're going to be very happy you know it's true I want to build a dome because you know you have all these countries now and more and more they want the weapons and they got the missiles and they got everything and we now have it down Ronald Reagan wanted to do that he was met with tremendous anger from Russia I said why are they angry if we want to build a shield but that's the way it was but we're going to build a shield and we have a technology you see it now working all the time it shoots down needles in the sky we have the greatest technology in the world that we're going to build a dome right around this country and we're going to save ourselves from some maniac that wants to start shooting at us right and it means a lot of jobs and that's one that I like a lot I will end Joe Biden's war in American energy and we will unleash our most powerful economic weapon we are going to drill for so much oil we are going to as I said before we are going to drill baby drill we're going to bring down your costs we're going to drink we are bringing down your energy costs we have the highest energy costs anywhere now and you know energy is really what started inflation and I don't know if you've ever heard but inflation is called a country buster you can go back 300 years and you can see why some great empires failed many of them fail because of the word inflation you look at Germany all day Germany and you look at so many other countries inflation is a country buster and it's busting our country right now where bacon is five times more expensive than it was just assured what bacon even I say I don't want any bacon it's too expensive but we're going to get it under control and we're going to do it fast because we're going to have so much energy and the prices are going to come down and everything else is going to follow under crooked Joe Biden the economy is floundering families are suffering and the largest growth industry in our country by far is government it's the only thing that's growing when I'm reelected we will stop Joe Biden's inflation disaster and we will rebuild the greatest economy in the history of the world we'll do it and unlike Ron de Sanctimonious I will always protect social security and Medicare he did not protect it he wanted to do bad things to it for our great senior citizens and when I get back into the oval office I will totally obliterate the deep state we started with Komi we got rid of them and we got rid of a lot of bad people we will root out the corruption bribery and influence selling in our nation's capital and we will start by exposing every last crime committed by crooked Joe Biden because now that he indicted me we're allowed to look at him but he did real bad things we will restore law and order to our communities and I will direct a completely overhaul DOJ to investigate every Marxist prosecutor in America for their illegal racist and reverse enforcement of the law on day one I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial sexual or political content onto our children and I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mass mandate we are going to make America great again it's not going to take very long not going to take very long and I will keep men out of women's sports is that okay I will fully uphold the second amendment I will continue to protect innocent life we will restore free speech and I will secure our elections like they've never been secured before by the way our goal on elections will be one day voting with paper ballots and voter ID is that okay now they'll really cheat they'll get those machines humming they'll say we got to get this guy out of there he's going to cause us to lose a fortune yeah we want paper ballot you know they make paper now watermark paper that's amazing we want paper ballots France didn't France just went to paper ballots one day voting voter ID 36 billion people it took place at a winner that'll lose everyone home and the loser was unhappy the winner was happy and they'll already started the next fight but you know what they had no disputes they had mail-in ballots long time ago and they turned out to be so corrupt anytime you have mail-in ballots you have corrupt elections I don't care what it is it's anybody that wants it they're corrupt and that includes Republicans by the way anytime you have any time you have mail-in ballots you are going to have really corrupt elections but until then Republicans must win we have to win so we can do this and in conclusion this is what we must do to restore our country to greatness together we're taking on some of the most menacing forces and vicious opponents are people have ever seen no matter how hateful or corrupt the communist and criminals we're fighting against maybe you must never forget this nation does not belong to them this nation belongs to you it belongs to the people with us tonight that's how we want this is your home this is your heritage and our American liberty is your God given right from Tampa to Tallahassee from Pensacola to Sarasota from Gainesville to Jacksonville to Miami we inherit the legacy of generations of American patriots who gave their blood sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom we stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans blaze the trail settle the continent tame the wilderness laid down the railroads dug out the Panama Canal nobody thought it was possible raised up the skyscrapers one two world wars defeated fascism and communism and from right here in this beautiful state launched our brave American astronauts to plant the American flag on the face of the moon together they made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world we are a nation in decline we are a failing nation we are a nation that is the highest inflation in 50 years where banks are collapsing and interest rates are skyrocketing likewise we are a nation where energy costs have reached the highest in our history we are no longer energy independent or energy dominant we were just there a very short number of years ago we are a nation that is begging Venezuela and many others for oil please please please help us Joe Biden says yet we have more liquid gold right under our feet than any other country anywhere in the world we are a nation that just recently heard that Saudi Arabia and Russia will be reducing their output of oil and substantially increasing the price and that threat is met by announcing that we will no longer be drilling for oil in large areas of Alaska and other parts of our country we are a nation that is consumed by the radical left screen new deal yet everyone knows that the green new deal is fake and will lead to our country's destruction we are a nation whose leaders are demanding all electric cars despite the fact that they can't go far cost too much and whose batteries and all of the other elements of those horrible cars are produced in China with materials only available in China when an unlimited amount of gasoline is available inexpensively right here in the United States but it's not available in China and now we are a nation that wants to make our great army tanks all electric so that despite the fact that they will not be able to go very far fewer pollutants will be released into the air of the territory that we are trying to conquer and they also want to make our fighter jets with a green energy stamp losing 15% efficiency but allowing us to keep our enemies atmosphere crystal clear while we attempt to knock out their air force we are a nation that ended oil exploration and production in the United States just as the price of oil reached and all time high what other country would do such a thing we are a nation that surrendered in Afghanistan leaving behind dead soldiers American citizens and 85 billion dollars worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world we are a nation that allowed Russia to devastate a country Ukraine killing hundreds of thousands of people and it will only get worse it would never have happened with me as your president and for four straight years it didn't happen and China with Taiwan is next we are a nation that has weaponized its law enforcement against opposing political parties something that we have never done before we've got a federal bureau of investigation that won't allow bad election changing facts to be presented to the public in which offers one million dollars to a writer of fiction about Donald Trump to lie and said was a fact not fiction where Hunter Biden's laptop from hell was Russian disinformation and the FBI knew it wasn't but 51 intelligence agents said it was and they knew it wasn't also and a department of justice that refuses to investigate egregious acts of voting irregularities and fraud and we have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president in the history of our country who is cognitively impaired in no condition to lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war which would be World War III and far more devastating than any of the previous World Wars because of the weaponry that no one ever wants to think about talk about but it's there we are a nation that no longer has a free and fair press fake news is all you get and they are the enemy of the people they refuse to discuss the Biden crime family but enjoy covering false indictments of Donald Trump who has done nothing wrong we are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed and where crime is rampant and out of control like never ever before we are a nation that is allowing Iran to build a massive nuclear weapon and China to use the trillions of dollars that is taken from us to build a military to rival its own and less than three years ago we had Iran China Russia and North Korea in check they weren't going to do a thing against us and everyone knows that was the fact now Russia and China are holding summits to carve up the world and perhaps most importantly we are a nation that is no longer respected or listen to on the world stage we are a nation that in many ways has become a joke we are a nation that is hostile to liberty to freedom and to faith we are a nation whose economy is collapsed into a cesspool of ruin whose supply chain is broken whose stores are not stopped whose deliveries are not coming and whose educational system is ranked at the very bottom of every single list we are a nation where large packs of sadistic criminals and thieves are allowed to go into stores and openly rob them beat up and kill their workers and customers and leave with armed loads of goods but with no retribution where the authority of our great police has been taken where their families and pensions have been threatened and their lives would be destroyed for the mere mention of the words law enforcement we are a nation where fentanyl and all of the other forms of illegal drugs are easier to get than formula for our beautiful little babies a nation whose once revered airports are dirty they're crowded they're a mess you sit and wait for hours and then are notified that the plane won't leave and they have no idea when they will where ticket prices have tripled they don't have the pilots to fly the planes they don't seek qualified air traffic controllers and they just don't know what the hell they're doing we are a nation that has lost its confidence its willpower and its strength we are a nation that has lost its way but we are not going to allow this to continue three years ago we were a great nation and we will soon be a great nation again it was the hard working patriots like you who built this country and is the hard working patriots like you who are going to save our country we will fight for America like no one has ever fought before with you at my side we will demolish the deep state we will drive out the globalists we will cast out the communist we will throw off the sick political class and we will route the fake news media we will drain the swamp and we will liberate our country from these tyrants

again thank you Florida God bless you all God bless you all thank you Florida I get three four for free, I should thank the meters in the distance. I don't you ever be sad, you don't need to look at my eyes away. I'm going to have some trump Syrigots a step out here in a few minutes. But Christina that was classic president Donald J. Trump here in Florida. Classic Trump and I love it when he kind of pulls the crowd and basically has a conversation with the people in the crowd. You know he was introducing some of the notable people who were in attendance. And I thought it was interesting that one of them was booed and president says, oh you don't like them. He's like, oh we got to we got to fix that. We got to get that figured out. So it's great that he gets feedback from the people in the crowd as well. A fantastic job by president Trump again. Fantastic job by his team. I think this was one of one of the better rallies I think that we've been to in a while. Wonderful. Okay, let's talk about our friends over at the Birch School group with another government shut down looming. It's important to invest in gold silver and precious metals.

Let's step aside so we can show it. We're going to step back behind the spin room area here as we get ready to have several of the Trump Syracuse will be coming by as well as. And it's great to get to see the the crowd as a lot of the speakers I understand Rose and bars there are Huckabee Sanders. Carrie Lake they're all going to be filing through they're going to be doing like a media row kind of like a red carpet that there's approximately 20 other news networks here that they're just pretty much going straight down the line. And the crowd here are folks from of course from the crowd that was watching President Trump speak they were selected to come back here given of course some swag some jump hats we've got the flags and the the flyers that they're waving the things that they're holding everyone's in good spirits excited to get up close and personal with some of their favorite Trump Syracuse with some of their favorite political candidates and the soldiers. I really love the U.S.E. fighter that he talked about tonight and said hey I don't even want to want to mess with the six-year-old son he's got the jeans of a fighter I thought that was a good moment. It was a very interesting moment here tonight because we know how passionate the people are here in South Florida for the president and how passionate they are about about this country they love this country and the Latin America the Latin American citizens here when when someone was get up there and speak in Spanish to them they loved it and they would absolutely crazy when that was happening. That was a lot of fun and as the speakers would speak in Spanish and ask questions that engage with the crowd the vast majority of the crowd was responding and they were reacting to the Spanish language you know the Spanish message that they were that they were giving. So yeah it just been a really fun very Latin type very Hispanic type of rally more so I think than we've really seen before and of course you know a lot of people representing the Cuban culture the Nicaraguan culture we heard from folks from Venezuela so there's a lot of pride in those communities a lot of pride from those cultures and they're all excited to be out here today and represent with of course with president Trump but also with with the folks that are going to be coming down media row here in a minute. Yeah I think it's kind of a little special moments at Christina we really haven't had anything like this post Trump rally of course we've had backstage interviews with the president which are nice but nothing like this setup we have now obviously the space is tight there's a reason why you're not seeing Christina and I on camera right now because there's no where to stand but I love what they've done here they've got a great crowd assembled in front of us. It was a tremendously successful rally we've talked about this all night that the team has put together a formula here that that works and it's size wise I think the time obviously the timing of the GOP debate tonight it was very good going on that as well and I got to say our views our views across all of our platforms have we're back we're back in that rally mode viewership category which people are known to you know again so used to watching us the numbers were great tonight we probably had more people watching us that were possibly watching the GOP debate on a lot of these stations so very happy with tonight's broadcast and I you know I think today after this is over and this is the first time we've done this in room and so I this could be 15 minutes could be 20 minutes we don't know but nevertheless we're glad that we're here right now I'm almost thinking in a way like we should probably maybe move over right I tell you what I am going to do move about right here you stay right there I'm going to move right here just so we have a little bit more room to talk but what a what a just a great night here in South Florida Absolutely and I give a lot of kudos to President Trump's team for arranging this they try to keep the Israelis fresh and current and provide something new we've we've got the hype guy walking the crowd right now getting everyone riled up they're all so I'm really curious to see if we're at the very beginning of the walk or after the walk they come in through here or they come in down there so we're the last ones don't get to out of here which we like that we like that we like to be the last ones so we are on the very end of the row here which is great so we're going to see them after they come through all the all the other media outlets but yeah I would have went in fantastic rally and they kind of go programming wise on 11 and 11th November 11th is when we'll be back a new ham sure Matthew Alvarez we'll have the coverage in new ham sure a very special remarks there on the grandest date and of course as we go towards Thanksgiving Christina I have been told that the guy watching the rally right now on the app I love when the people do that I've been told we'll have about three more events possibly before the end of the month so probably going to be back in Iowa back in new ham sure and go visit the great state of Nevada yeah and it's really I don't know how President Trump's I can't even call them challengers because it's not quite a challenge he's crushing them by 50 point but how they can even compete with him because not only is he out campaigning them in all of the early states but he also has to deal he also has to deal with the legal challenges that are being thrown at him and there's a reason that the federal government is only going after Donald Trump and why they're not going after the ronda santa says and niki hailes because the ronda santa says and niki hailes of this campaign are part of the problem they're in bed with the swamp they're political opportunists and oh here we go we've got a lot of right on ronda santa here we ask you this was another debate of I guess the five remaining contenders right trying to take on the former president but we call it no consider it not worth your time right well it's it's actually an interview to be the first place loser you know with everybody pulling in you know very low double digits you know the president said 50 some points you know way ahead so they're really irrelevant I mean in tonight's the debate actually because we were watching it backstage tonight's debate you know it didn't move the needle at all and you know there weren't any major contrast made I mean you know a couple of foes from a lot of the folks that were there but at the end of the day it was just another example example Donald Trump won the debate again I mean you know we had a great energetic crowd here and Miami and in an area that belabs them and you know while Donald Trump is having names you know streets named after him you know ronda santa says getting paved over despite that right you guys go back to Iowa yeah because there's got a campaign to run right and that's at least the one state where perhaps things are the strongest they could be well I don't I mean maybe according to ronda sect of only is sir you know but from our standpoint what we have going on in Iowa is second to none I mean we have a solid organization in all of the counties we have a precinct staffed up I mean you know from where the campaign was in 2016 from where it was today it's not forget you know Donald Trump ran for election in the state of Iowa four times one three of the four times so he's got an enormous amount of goodwill there the campaign I mean the data backs it up so we're just being very aggressive and when we are aggressive and when we're running a campaign and what we're doing the things that we have to do it scares the other side and they like oh my god if you're if you're winning why are you running a campaign that's like the dumbest question I've ever heard what do you make it what happened in Ohio and Virginia and Kentucky well as you know I live in the Commonwealth of Virginia and I think a lot of it and if you actually look at what happened in Virginia Republicans lost the Senate by less than two thousand combined votes they lost the house by less than 2,500 combined votes so what what I see is a very split state that you know tactically maybe we could have done things a little differently but at the end of the day I still think it's very much a purple state very one that's very much one that is in play governor youngkins done just about everything that he could do with what he has but and then in Ohio you know really didn't follow a whole lot going on in Ohio Kentucky you know in Kentucky they've only elected three Republican governors since Truman so they look clearly look at things a little differently there but but obviously had a big win last night in Mississippi getting take dreams over 51 you know abortion was a factor in all those losses and it's an issue it's going to be hard for Republicans to avoid right right pulling the shows inflation is the issue Republican voter want him talking about right right well I don't know portions of it concerned for it portions always been an important part of of the issue sector least for Republicans the Democrats are very much motivated on it but look at the end of the day you know the economy and a whole lot of other issues are going to take dominance but it's one that we're going to have to deal with and I think that one that president is very well equipped to deal with and how he been to be around this week having had to go to New York to test by having seen his children yeah well I mean no one wants to see their children go through something like that and I know it was tough but you know he's a very very defiant and and you know it took over the whole courtroom so you know again he's he's very much motivated and when he sees this and he sees these crowds I mean they really boy him and they really get him get him motivated and get him out there and and and you know so he's looking for and the next debate is scheduled for next month in Alabama sure he's not going so still not here first no until he does until he does if they were if it were down to like one or two what do you do it then I mean I can we could play hypotheticals online long but when you're winning by 50 there's no really no need to go any to go show up would be president Biden oh that's without a how many times will he show up that's that's he's our guy thank you. Hey what is the biggest challenge right now for the campaign I've got this massive lead already but is there any challenges or anything you guys are particularly focused on right now great question well with president Trump ahead by 50 points in the primary beating Joe Biden in the general election not just at the national level but in all of the swing states right now we have to just keep the pressure on the thing that the president always tells us is do not play prevent defense the only thing a prevent defense does is prevent you from winning so he says don't let up don't take your eye off the ball stay aggressive with it we're going to do that all the way through we've seen the obviously we're here in a very dense Hispanic community what is the president think about these poll numbers that are keep increasing amongst the Latina American the well communities all across the United States whether it be Latinos black Americans white Americans Asian Americans everyone wants to have the economy that we had just three short years ago people want to have a safe and secure southern border they want to have streets where they can actually walk and without getting mugged or shot they don't want war in Ukraine but that's what Joe Biden has done to our country when president Trump walked off stage the night did he say anything to you or the team they just gave us a fist bump and said let's do it again tomorrow. Do you watch any of the main yeah what's he talking about look I think while president Trump was here in high LA having streets named after him Rob DeSaint-Demonius was in Miami getting paved over. He used that line too so you workshop that one but I'm on message. I'm on message. Sorry. One of the things that we just heard was he doesn't have any plans to attend the next debate I mean you want to elaborate on that or just comment president Trump. President Trump won't be participating in the primary debates he's ahead by 50 points why would he go and participate. He's very much looking forward debating Joe Biden in the general election I'm not even sure Joe Biden is going to show up. I'm not sure Joe Biden even knows there is an election next year quite frankly I think there's American public as we've seen with the New York Times polling all of the polling shows that people are just absolutely sick and tired of Joe Biden only to see demonstrate weakness and by the feebleness that he's shown the disastrous economy southern border everything's been a disaster. I'm sorry was it Jen I think you're like what are you concerned about that I think I'm not concerned about it because again when president Trump is on the ballot Republicans win. So next year when it's president Trump on the ballot and Joe Biden on the ballot is going to be a completely different scenario. But I think when you look at Kentucky from last night first of all Kim Reynolds the RGA chair should have been in Kentucky on Monday night campaigning for Daniel Cameron but she was in Iowa campaigning for Rob this ain't demonious. But if you're the RGA chair all right that's just like you have one job doing campaign for candidates for governor and she couldn't even do that right. But I don't think that Daniel Cameron was able to talk about abortion right I think president Trump was right on that. Hey Republicans better figure out how to talk about it Democrats are the extremists if they're supporting abortion at 7-8-9 months they're the ones who are out of step with Americans. They're thing too I don't think that Daniel Cameron is able to wash the stink of Mitch McConnell off of them. I think that was a big problem. I mean he was your divorce candidate though you must see him else like that. He was that we wanted very much one to him to win. You saw president Trump campaigning for or you know doing the tele rallies doing the commercials doing a number of things for him. So he didn't win but there's some candidates you just can't pull across the finish line. And then with Virginia, Duncan and Republicans are kind of trying to moderate and stand on abortion at 15. And that would affect him. So he was like looking at yesterday thinking this is going to be a problem that fits with the state of Ohio. Well keep in mind that I don't think Ohio work on you're going to be in play. Keep in mind that you know bad dynamic on abortion. Still have it a big hit line. Well if the debate is about Democrats being the extremist and how we can come to some sort of consensus as a country. And I think Republicans are going to be winning. I think Duncan led with this. I think I think I think Duncan led with his chin making the debate all about weeks. And I think that put him in an unfortunate position on his heels. So I think that's part of the reason. But look look at Mississippi where the Trump back candidate won. That take Rams was reelected. And there's a reason why everyone wants president Trump's endorsement. What's your take on R&C reform? On the R&C reform. Look I'll we'll have to see what the R&C members do on that. But better have their act together for next year. And Jason Jimmy reaction to the debate. Yeah I thought President Trump dominated the debate. If you watched it I know you were here. I do love it. It's like the debate is better. It's like the. We were watching it. We were watching it in the back. Yeah. Well well President Trump was here in high LA having streets named after him. Rob DeSync Demonius was in Miami getting paved over. It was a disaster. DeSync Demonius did nothing to reverse the trend in this race. I don't know. I mean DeSync just will be lucky if he's even a good performance for him. Not a good performance for him. I have my time because I don't know what you think of it. President Trump's on the trajectory to win. He's going to make sure that he wins. He'll be back in Iowa campaigning. But again nothing happened on that debate stage in Miami tonight to change the trajectory. Do you have any ideas on what we can do? Do you have anything about the trial as in the way to the campaigns? Well, well, an impact. One impact anything the president Trump is doing. Well, every time they in Diedham or attack him legally his numbers go up. I mean the American people see what's going on. They see the witch hunt. They see this is Joe Biden and Merrick Garland. I'm sorry. And well, it happens to be the truth. I mean there's only one reason why they're doing it is because they're scared about Joe Biden losing next fall. And so here's the deal. We have a plane. We have social media following of well over 100 million people. We have the best candidate in world history. These indictments are going to backfire on Joe Biden, the Democrats. Thank you Jason Miller joining us here. The spin room is looks like we have Carrie Lake is coming up next. But just to give you guys an idea they've got this long line. Obviously you can't see it by the way that the cameras are positioned. So let's see. All right. So let's see. I might quite sure who that is. We'll switch over. So as we wait. So we're going to as we wait. Obviously Jason Miller really going over some of the talk you points for the president saying look there's streets named. By Trump here in the South Florida. This is very much Trump country. And you know what I think the people showing up tonight reflects that. Absolutely. Trump country. I got a little bit of insight. I asked what the hang up was on Carlos Jimenez. The congressman that they ended up booing. And apparently he endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. Which I am not forgotten about that. They have not forgotten. I don't mind that they're holding grudges. However, since then my understanding is he's been. He's been great and really voted along. You know true conservative lines. But they're holding that one grudge from a few years ago that. And he might be have a hard time shaking that. Well, I can't say that I did not get a few calls from friends that said did I just hear that right? Did they just boo somebody on stage? We've seen that before. We've seen that with Mo Brooks. He said something about the election. Lindsey Graham was booed in Pickens. South Carolina. Where he actually grew up in Pickens. In that county. Yeah, that was actually. I enjoyed that one. Yeah. Not gonna lie. Yeah, Lindsey Lindsey Graham. Well, he came out and was trying to like. I don't know. He was trying to act like he's all mad guy. Everyone was telling them that he was a war monger and whatnot. So it wasn't anything as the beer. All yours. Thank you. Come on in here. This is perfect. The thing just opened up for us a little bit more. But but yeah, so you know it happens. I mean that's something that. Unfortunately, and this is the world of politics. People they have memories and what I'm hoping. Is that by the time we get to. November of 2024. That people remember how somebody's people in Congress. Has voted and they remember who they need to. Step up and replace but. Well that. That's exactly what we were saying before and it was demonstrated tonight. That people are paying attention now. You know before people may not have even known who their member of Congress was. But now they do and now they remember how who they endorsed in 2016. There we go. Who we've got. Mayor of the city. How are you? How are you doing, Mayor? Good. Good to see you. Thanks for joining us today. We're live on the air here in the spin room. Let's talk about the well. Let's talk about the popularity of President Trump here in your town of Halea. We love him and we've loved him now for the last four years. I mean we saw what happened during his presidency. They didn't let him govern. It wasn't just Democrats and with some Republicans also running interference. Never seen anything like that in our life except in you know socialists and communist countries. And so there's a lot of Cuban Americans here that know exactly what that looks like. And that's why you see them gyrate toward the president. Yeah on the pre show we were outside talking to a lot of your residents that live here in your town. Very passionate about the president but very passionate about this country and you just touched on it. They know what the alternative is if we're able to go walk down that path of socialism. Look I've said this many times that I think sometimes you know liberals and big thinkers think some in some way Hispanics need to be talked down to. Cuban Americans, Mexican Americans, others want the same thing that everybody else wants. Prosperity, opportunities. You don't need to give us any kind of handout or any or you know skew test in our favor. Just give us an opportunity to compete and that speaks to every American I think right. So that's why I think when he speaks it does not he's not speaking just to Hispanics. I think he's speaking to all of us and we get it. What are some of the biggest concerns of your citizens in your town? I know the economy came up a lot and people are struggling to make ends meet. What are you seeing as a mayor that people are wanting to change here? Well let me tell you a narrative that doesn't get talked about. When you don't have border security you have people coming in. A city like ours takes in a lot of folks. Okay. What it does to our rent market here is just throws it out of whack. And I got a lot of people. I got a lot of people knocking on my door looking for some sort of subsidized housing because they can't afford where they live. That's a direct product of what's going on at the border. The story is there's about 420,000 Cubans that have come in to the United States over the last two years. That is the equivalent to a Mariette boat lift. Okay. Back in the 80s. I would tell you about 40% of that ends up being in my city. If New York can't handle it, imagine a city like this one that is blue-collar small town mentality. It is tough. So when you talk about border security, the cities are the ones that are dealing with the front line. And we're no exception to that. Do you have a chance to talk to the president when he walked off the stage tonight? I didn't get to talk to him off stage. I did get to talk to him a little bit before we went on stage. I told him, you know, we're going to name him street after you. Because we care about you here and we support you. And, you know, I think he was a little surprised. He didn't think I'd do it. And I said, we're going to do it absolutely. Mayor, we appreciate your time. You got a lot of folks here. I'm going to talk to you as well. Thank you. Mayor of Hylia. I mean, hey, we've talked about how these citizens are here passionate and the concerns of them. And once you know it, he brought up the border again. And he is a perfect example of the importance of local politics and local elections. He is the mayor here of Hylia and he is engaged with what his constituents want, what they need. He is raising the issues that need to be raised with the president. He's got the audience that he needs to have. I can't stress enough how important it is that Americans pay attention to the local politics, local offices, and make sure you're voting for someone who actually supports your values. Not who has an arm behind their name, but who is the candidate, the right candidate, to support conservative values? I was really impressed with the speech too. The crowd was fired up. They loved what he had to say. He seems to resonate really closely. You could definitely understand why they love him here in this town. Like you said, he came out and spoke the crowd. Got him fired up. I spoke to Spanish, which I love. So everyone loved that. But you can obviously, you can tell that he is very popular in this town. And he brought up a great point about rents. About the rents and that it does drive the rents up, which is amazing. I never thought about that aspect of illegal immigration, but now I do. Yeah, well, it changes a lot of the dynamic in the economy, especially when you have a large chunk of the now population with these illegal immigrants coming in. And all of their rents and their needs are being paid for by the government. And so now you have other people who have to, the actual citizens here, who have to make up that difference. And it drives prices up because the landlords know that the rents going to be paid because the government is paying it if they provide for these illegal aliens. But citizens have to pay their own way and it's causing prices to go up and it's a real problem. We also have Stephen Chung communications. I believe director over that. He's got an interview right now. I'll hopefully get him back over here. And then I'd also see Carrie Lake as the next section over. I would imagine she's going to progressively walk towards us. If you're just out joining us, yes, we're live. We're still live in Trump country here in South Florida for the Spend Room, Christina Barb-Bringland with you along for the ride. Wrap it up a little bit, a little bit longer to spend room than we'll wrap up what's been a fantastic day here in South Florida. And of course, we kicked off this cover today at 2 p.m. local time. So I do encourage you that if you missed a lot of the fanfare talking to the people. The Trump supporters that were lining up up outside, I do encourage you to go back and watch that and kind of re-wreck that and watch it. And usually what we see is people will do that. They'll go back and watch that. We certainly appreciate all of that. We'll see if we can get Carrie Lake over here. Here we go. Hi, oh my gosh, the world of policy. Hello, I bet you guys were all watching tonight. I am so excited for our future. I know you're thinking, wait a minute, Carrie, we're living in Joe Biden's world at tonight. And it's true, it is. The President Trump laid out his plan to get us through this. We're going to have a lot ahead of us in the next year, but he laid out his plan on how we turn America around. And I am so encouraged by that. I don't want anybody to lose hope in our future. We're going to get President Trump in office and he's going to immediately get to work, roll his sleeves up and get things done. We know he did it before. We had four great years under President Trump. And even people in the fake news media, if you ask them, if you ask them, they'll say that they were doing better under President Trump. They may not want to admit that too loudly because they've been pushing and fighting for Joe Biden and his failed policies. But it's incredible. What I heard tonight was an absolute plan for turning the nightmare around and getting us back on the right track and actually having our best days ahead of us. So I'm excited. I'm excited for my children's future. But we can't rest on our laurels. We know President Trump is so far ahead in the polls. We know that when it comes to beating Biden, that's going to happen because it's doing great and all of the polling with the battleground states. But we can't then lay back and say, OK, somebody else has got this. We have to be there with them. It's going to take we the people to save our country. We have a great leader and candidate and president that will do that with President Trump. But he can't do it alone. And just like in the 81-year-old Thomas Jefferson said when he was crafting the United States Constitution, the woman stopped him as he was leaving and said, what kind of a government have you given us? And he said a republic if you can keep it. We're in the if you can keep it part. And it can't just be one man trying to keep it. It has to be all of us. And we can never fall into a slumber again. Once we start turning this around, we have to stay vigilant and on top of it because this is our country. He often talks about swapping the vote. It's going to take a lot of people that might not have felt like voting again for whatever reason. But it's going to take an overwhelming response at the polls in November to be whoever the opponent is, could be Joe Biden, could be somebody else. What's your thoughts on voter turnout in 2024? I think it's going to be massive, unlike anything we've ever seen. You know, in the past, we've seen really low voter turnout seen 20 years ago. We'd be shocked at how few people were voting because of what Joe Biden and the Democrats have done to our country left it in shambles. People struggling so much. People who can't afford to feed their families. They can't afford the gas in their car. They're losing their jobs. They're watching as a war is starting to rage. The borders wide open. It's sadly it's gotten so bad that's going to get people off the couch and out to the polling places. And they're going to vote like their lives depend on it, their children's lives, and their country depends on it. So I think I think he's right. We are going to swamp the vote. Absolutely. We talked a lot of people on the streets today that live in this area. Broken border, immigration, big issue here. What's your thoughts on the president's border policy? Well, we, you know, Brian, and you know this, I worked as a journalist, a fair and honest journalist in Arizona for almost 30 years, 27 years. And I'd never seen that border more secure than under President Trump. He took the laws we had on the books. He started enforcing the laws. He was building the wall. It was incredible. And he even talked about that tonight. How the very few people able to get across illegally. And then on day one, Joe Biden tore that policy back with a wink and a nod told the world to come across. We are seeing millions of people pour across. Our world is not safe anymore. The Hamas terror attack that we saw on October 7th in Israel. It only takes one phone call from these terrorist networks to their cells that are in America right now to send us into a tailspin of absolute horror. And so we've got to secure that border. I frankly hope we don't have to wait for President Trump to get back in office. I frankly hope that Washington DC gets their act together and makes it priority numero uno to get that wall built and secure that border. And I'll tell you who wants to secure border more than anyone. As somebody who came here legally. As somebody who went through the legal immigration process, they're horrified at what they're seeing. And many of these people came here. Many of the people in this amazing rally tonight came from countries. They came here through legal immigration. And they left communism. They left socialism. And they're seeing it come back. And they're seeing the borders be overrun. And they're horrified. Here we go. Thank you so much. I appreciate a good seeing you. God bless. Yes. Yes. All right. I tell you what we're going to do. That looks like we've run the gamut for all of this. So I tell you what. We're going to go ahead and see if we can spin this around. And you know, we're kind of recap. Yeah, we can go right here. So what we've learned today is, well, South Florida doesn't matter what day of the week and what time. President Trump is just Trump country. And we also learned that, well, when it comes to the GOP debate for the next debate, President Trump has no plans on going to it. But we've talked about this many times. There's no need to debate. It's almost like a football team going 14 and two in the regular season. Or 16 and oh, I should even say. And then expecting to place somebody the first round of the playoffs. It's not going to happen. But we heard it first here tonight. So that was one of the questions that I got asked a lot was, is he going to debate? And we got that answer tonight, folks. And he's not. No, and I love how the critics left us. They always he scared to debate. And they act as if the R&C debates are the main event. Judging by this row of 20 something news outlets here that stayed behind to interview Trump's surrogates. Remember, this isn't even for President Trump. It's for the Trump surrogates, the people who came and have endorsed and are supporting Donald Trump. I think it's safe to say that this is the main event. It's not whatever was happening elsewhere in Miami tonight with the R&C. And I have a feeling the numbers are going to reflect that.
