 What do we move? Thank you. We are a new way. We are a new way. We are a new way. We are a new way. Well, thank you very much. And I'm thrilled to be back at CPAC with thousands of great and true American patriots. And that's what you are. I want to start by thanking Matt and Mercedes Schlapp and everyone at the American Conservative Union. Thank you, Matt. For hosting this wonderful event, it really has been something over the years. I also want to web so many people here. I'm going to leave out some, but they'll understand. We have a lot of Congress, a lot of Senate, a lot of everything, but we'll do a few words and a few names.

Jason Smith, friend of mine, great guy. Thank you, Jason. Wesley Hunt, Corey Mills, Dr. Ronnie Jackson. He's an admo, where's Ronnie Jackson?

A friend of mine, a man who's terrific. Almost one for governor of New York could have done it, but so many people have moved out of New York. He's a great stuffer, but he's a terrific guy. Great lawyer too. And he's a strong guy. You know, he stopped somebody coming at him with a knife. I don't know. He grabbed that guy's hand. He looked pretty tough, and he drove him to the ground, Lee Zeldin, Whizley. Hi, Lee. Thank you. Good job, Lee. West Virginia Attorney General, Patrick Morrissey, Patrick. Thank you, Patrick.

General Keith Kellogg. Thank you, Keith. A very popular man in South America, a very, very popular in Brazil, the former president of Brazil. President Bolsonaro. Great honor. I don't know. You beat all these U.S. politicians. That's pretty good. And his son is a friend of mine, Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo Bolsonaro. Hi, Eduardo. Great job you're doing. Just got reelected. And somebody that we really like in this room, I think. I certainly like him a lot. He had a lot of courage. Very smart guy. James O'Keefe. Where's James? Where's James? Thank you, James. Thank you, James. Good guy. As we gather today, our country and our movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country is nobody can even question it. In the fake news media, that's a lot of fake news back then. And by the way, I want to thank the fire department. Look at these people. They're up the rafters. Thank you, fire department. But the greatest in our history, most important battle in our lives is taking place right now, as we speak. For seven years, you and I have been engaged in an epic struggle to rescue our country from the people who hate it and want to absolutely destroy it. The sinister forces trying to kill America have done everything they can to stop me, to silence you, and to turn this nation into a socialist dumping ground for criminals, junkies, Marxists, thugs, radicals, and dangerous refugees that no other country wants. No other country wants them. Of those opposing us succeed, our once beautiful USA will be a failed country that no one will even recognize a lawless, open borders, crime written, filthy communist nightmare. That's what it's going and that's where it's going. I used to say that we will never be a socialist country. I said it oftentimes. I said it once at the state of the Union address and people didn't understand what I was saying. That shouted out loud and I was right because that train has passed the station long ago of socialism. It never even came close to stopping, frankly. We're now in a Marxism state of mind, a communism state of mind, which is far worse. We're nation into decline. Our enemies are desperate to stop us because they know that we are the only ones who can stop them. They know that this room is so important. The people in this room. They know that we can defeat them. They know that we will defeat them, but they're not coming after me. They're coming after you and I'm just standing in their way. That's all I'm doing. I'm standing in their way. That's why I'm here today. That's why I'm standing before you because we are going to finish what we started. We started something that was America. We're going to complete the mission. We're going to see this battle through to ultimate victory. We're going to make America great again. We're going to make America great again. With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state. We will expel the war mongers. They are people that don't get it. Although in some cases they get it. They get it for their wallets. We can't do that. We can't let that happen. We will drive out the globalists. We will cast out the communists. We will throw off the political class that hates our country. They actually hate our country. No walls, no borders. No war elections, no voter ID. We will beat the Democrats. We will route the fake news media. We will expose and appropriately deal with the rhinos. We will evict Joe Biden from the White House. And we will liberate America from these villains and scoundrels once and for all. And we started this journey, a journey like there has never been before. There's never been anything like this. We had a Republican party that was ruled by freaks, neocons, globalists, open-border zealots, and fools. But we are never going back to the party of Paul Ryan, Karl Rove, and Jipush. When not going back to people that want to destroy our great social security system, even some in our own party, I wonder who that might be. That want to raise the minimum age of social security to 70, 75, or even 80 in some cases. And then are out to cut Medicare to a level that it will no longer be recognizable. And when that was their original thought, that's what they always come back to. Remember that. You have to remember that. You heard it here first. We are never going back to a party that wants to give unlimited money to fight foreign wars that are endless wars, that are stupid wars. But at the same time demands that we cut veterans' benefits and retirement benefits at home, our soldiers will no longer live in the streets of our city. We have cities where our soldiers, our great soldiers, are living on concrete. They are living on asphalt. We will take care of our soldiers. There has never been a time like this. Illegal immigrants come in, and we house them in the Waldorf Astoria and many other of the greatest hotels anywhere in the world. And our soldiers, we do nothing for them. They sleep out at night and they freeze. They freeze in the cold and they die in the heat. Well people that came into our country illegally are in beautiful hotel suites, perhaps watching us on television right now. We were taking care of our soldiers just a short while ago, but we don't do that anymore, but we'll start doing it again. Our soldiers are very special to us. When a wonderful town in Ohio has difficulty, we are going to take care of that town, that city that village, prior to worrying about the rest of the world, we're taking care of the problems of the rest of the world, that they're not taking care of themselves. They have us put up the money. You know what I'm talking about. If you look at Ukraine and we all feel so badly about it, but why is it NATO putting up dollar for dollar with us? We put up $140 billion and they put up just a tiny fraction of that. And you know, we all want to see success, but it's far more important to them than it is to us because of that location. We are never going to be a country ruled by entrenched political dynasties in both parties, rotten special interests, China loving politicians of which there are many. You're listening to this Mitch McConnell, you're listening. And a millenit left-wing news media that's either frightened of telling the truth or is truly evil and bad. I don't know. I think in many ways they're frightened, but you never really know which. We are not going back to this mindset, not now, not ever. Not ever. And thank you Mark Levin for being here tonight. Thank you, Harold. And Julie. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Very important voice. Stay healthy, Mark. We can't lose you. Just stay healthy. Stay healthy, Mark. We're not going to lose you. In 2016, we took away the power of this corrupt political class. And we did more in four years than any administration in the history of our country. Have you looked at what we built? We shut down the illegal foreign invasion of our borders and achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. We deported illegal criminal aliens by the tens of thousands. MS-13, taken them out by the thousands. We set records every single week. We were cleaning up our country. I smashed the false idols of the free trade fanatics. These are fools. Or they're getting very rich, probably the second. I'd left the China lobby reeling from our historic tariffs and taxes that we charge them. Bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into our treasury from China. Thank you very much, China. When no other president had gotten even ten cents, not one president got anything from them. Our trade deficits were five, six, seven hundred billion dollars a year. Billion, think of it. Dollars a year. Not sustainable by any country. They built a military. They have a very powerful military with the money that we gave them. How stupid are we? I was the only president in modern history who did not have any new wars. No new wars. I finished some old ones. I finished some old ones. Remember when the Democrats and my Republican opponents would often look at me during the debates or whatever and they'd say, no, no, he's going to bring us into World War III because it's a personality type. They said I had to person. No, I had the personality type that kept us out of wars because people knew that they weren't going to mess around with it. Why I rebuilt our military. We were strong. We were safe. And I told the link went foreign nations. They were delinquent. They weren't paying their bills. That if they wanted our protection, they had to pay up and they had to pay up now. And they did. They paid $450 billion as soon as I said, no, I won't be protecting you if you don't pay. We truly had a policy of peace through strength. This was a serious, powerful policy. We didn't have to lose our loved ones fighting wars in countries that nobody's ever heard of. I stood firm against the forces of Anarchy and Decay. I arrested the Marxists to topple statues of our great heroes in Washington, DC. They arrested them. They were knocking down the most beautiful artwork, the most beautiful statues of great heroes. They didn't even know who they were. They just wanted Anarchy and I passed. And so I did executive order. Anybody that does that gets ten years in jail with no negotiation. It's not ten, but it turns into three months. And it's an incredible thing that stopped right away. You know, they were heading to the Jefferson Memorial. They wanted to take out Thomas Jefferson. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think we're going to let that happen. But we passed it. It was a very old law. We found it. One of my very good, legal people, long-waste even Miller. They found it. They said, so I don't know if you want to try and bring this back. I said, I do. And as soon as we passed it, that was the end. It just stopped. It's amazing. It's a miracle. We banned transgender insanity from our military. It signed the world's first ban on critical race theory long before anybody had even heard of the term. It was all banned. Everything was good. When Biden came back in, this guy came in and he put everything right back in place where it was. We're paying these people hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in salary, among our highest paid people to teach all of this nonsense to our military yet. But it was all out. It was all done. There's only one president in history who has ever taken on the entire corrupt establishment in Washington. And when we win in 2024, we will do it again even stronger, faster and better because. Because now I am experienced and I know the people of Washington, I didn't know them. I was from New York. I only came here. Seventeen times they said I read that in the fake news. So probably it's not true. But it's the best I could do. And I never stayed over. I was from New York, but I now know the good ones, the bad ones, the weak ones, the strong ones. I know them all. I know the people that have to do the job and can do the job. A lot of them are in this room right now. And as I did for four incredible years, I will put America first every single time, every single day. From the beginning, we have been attacked by a sick and sinister opposition, the radical left communists, the bureaucrats, the fake news media, the big money, special interests, the corrupt, Democrat prosecutors, they're after me for so many things. Oh, those prosecutors, some are racists, some hate our country. They all hate me. They'll get me for anything, anything. You put a comma in this paragraph. Why did you do that? I don't really know. The partisan and often corrupt intelligence agencies, the George Soros money machine that spends a lot of money on the prosecutors, by the way. The Antifa thugs who are allowed to roam the streets while we have people that in many cases are great patriots, great, great patriots, sing prayers every night, playing our national anthem every day. And they're sitting in a jail nearby, rotting away and being treated so unfairly like nobody's has probably ever been treated in this country before, except maybe me. And Marjorie, you've been so fantastic on that issue. Where's Marjorie? You've been so fantastic on that issue. And Elise and Matt, people that love our country, people that love our country have been so great on that issue. And the perverts who use the names of Washington and Lincoln to buy millions of dollars in ads to say bad, lifeless and incorrect things about us. I didn't know this was a rally, Matt. It really is a rally. By the way, thank you for that beautiful straw poll. That was a big win. Thank you. Our enemies are lunatics and maniacs. They cannot stand that they do not own me. I don't need them. I don't need anything about them. I don't need their money. They cannot steer me. They cannot shake me. And they will never ever control me. And they will never ever, therefore, control you. At the end of the day, anyone else will be intimidated, bought off, blackmailed or ripped to shreds. I alone will never retreat. And that is why we must stand together and be charged. We have to charge full speed ahead. You know, I had a beautiful life before I did this. I lived in luxury. I had everything. People said to me, are you sure you want to do it, sir? I said, oh, this will be so amazing. What the hell did you get me into? I didn't know the word sapena. I didn't know the word grand jury, those words grand jury. I didn't know that they want to lynch you for doing nothing wrong. I didn't know they want to lynch you for doing a great job. I didn't know they want to put you away because your poll numbers are better than anybody they've seen in years. And then they go with the disinformation campaign. First of all, we're leading every Republican by massive numbers. And very importantly, perhaps more importantly, we're leading Biden by a lot. And we're leading Kamala by a lot. And every time the polls go up higher and higher, the prosecutors get crazier and crazier. We got to stop these guys. We have to stop Trump now. We got to stop him now because we can't stop him at the ballot box. You know, they tried that in 2016. How did that work out? Not too good. And we actually, and I have to say this, I hope Fox doesn't turn off, but we did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016. But we have no choice. If we don't do this, our country will be lost forever. People are tired of rhinos and lovelace. They want to see America first. That's what they want. It's not too complicated. This is the final battle. They know it. I know it. You know it. Everybody knows it. This is it. Either they win or we win. And if they win, we no longer have a country. And I promise you this, if you put me back in the White House, it's a beautiful building. But I live in very beautiful buildings. It's not that reason. It's beautiful. That building wasn't the easiest building to live in with what I was put through. And you know, I get a lot of credit. A lot of people say, how do you do it, sir? I had a man come up to me the other day, one of the toughest, strongest people that you can imagine. You all know his name. Big business man, a lot of money, a lot of success, tough as hell. I said, could I ask you a question, president? What, friend of mine used to call me Donald Loughley, cause we president. Could I ask you a question, president? What? How do you do it? How do you do it? Every day they sent you subpoenas. Every day they're after you. They're looking to take you down at levels that nobody's ever put up with before. Seven years I've gone through this, we beat them all. But it continues. And he said to me, seriously, how do you do it? I could never do it. But this is one of the toughest guys. I said, maybe you could. He said, nope, I couldn't do it. I couldn't get out of bed in the morning. But I do it for you, and that's what I'm doing it for. I do it for you. Thank you, Raman. And if you put me back in the White House, their rain is over. Their rain will be over. And they know it. And America will be a free nation once again. We're not a free nation right now. We don't have free press. We don't have free anything. In 2016 I declared, I am your voice. Today I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution. I am your retribution. I can't let this happen. I can't let it happen. I will totally obliterate the deep state. I will fire. I will fire the unelected bureaucrats and shadow forces who have weaponized our justice system like it has never been weaponized before. These are sick people. And I will put the people back in charge of this country. Again, the people will be back in charge of our country. The Biden administration is the most corrupt administration in American history. Hunter Biden is a criminal and nothing happened to him. Nothing happened. Joe Biden is a criminal and nothing ever seems to happen to him. Because you know, say what you want. But the Democrats stick together. They don't have Mitt Romney. They don't have guys like that. They stick together. How is Mitt Romney doing? Not too good. I can name plenty of others, too. But they do stick together. Whether you like them or not, and many of us don't, but maybe someday we get together. You know, a question was asked of me just before COVID came in. They said, the country is coming together. Do you think this is real? And I said to myself, it is real. It's amazing. I was getting calls from radical left people. The nicest calls, it's amazing. Because we had the best employment numbers in history. We had the best economy in history. We were lapping China. China was supposed to have taken over as the world's largest economy. And we were actually increasing at a level that nobody thought possible. We were doing great. And then you had COVID come in. And a lot of things had to happen. And we did a great job. We never got to credit for that job. But we did a great job with COVID. And then gave back something very strong. But we were really bringing this country together. Had COVID not come in, I think you would have had a much different. Because a lot of people want to know, can we all get along together? And if I didn't have that experience, I would say no, because the thought process is so different. But we were starting to really get along. And then we had the disaster, as I call it, the China virus, because I want to be open. And I want to be accurate. But Biden openly held back a billion-dollar taxpayer, open taxpayer money for the government of Ukraine. Remember he said, until they fired a prosecutor when they fired that prosecutor? And this prosecutor was after Hunter and the company that was paying him a fortune of money. Remember Joe Biden stood up and said, and I looked at them and I said, you're not getting that billion dollars. Until you get rid of that, I can't believe he did that. Can you imagine if I did that? I wouldn't be here right now, I suspect. And nobody picks it up. Well, I'd pick it up, Mr. President.
