      "description": "The experiment proposes a two-way ANOVA with a total corpus size of N=8. This results in only 2 observations per cell (n=2) in the 2x2 design, which is severely underpowered for reliable inferential statistics. The platform specification for N=4-9 recommends 'Case study analysis, qualitative patterns, individual document insights' rather than hypothesis testing.",
      "impact": "The ANOVA results will have very low statistical power, making it difficult to detect true effects and increasing the risk of type II errors. The findings may not be statistically robust or generalizable.",
      "fix": "In 'experiment.md', revise the analytical plan to focus on descriptive statistics, effect sizes (e.g., eta-squared), and qualitative pattern analysis. If ANOVA is performed, its results must be heavily caveated as exploratory rather than conclusive.",

      "impact": "This terminological inconsistency between the narrative description and the technical implementation will cause confusion for researchers interpreting the results, as the output data will be labeled 'mudita'.",
      "fix": "Standardize the terminology across all documents. It is recommended to update the prose in 'experiment.md' and 'corpus.md' to use 'mudita', as this matches the technical implementation in the framework's machine-readable appendix.",

      "impact": "While the corpus manifest's explicit 'era' metadata prevents an execution failure, the descriptive text in the experiment is misleading and does not accurately reflect the corpus design.",
