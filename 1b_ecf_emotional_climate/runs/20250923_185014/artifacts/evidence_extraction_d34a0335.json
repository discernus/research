That is the threat to American democracy.\",\n  \"That's a good thing, that's progress. Even though we didn't win the debate, we're starting to win the debate within, within our own party. And I think that really matters.\",\n  \"So that is a great achievement and a great amount of progress that we've made.\",\n  \"the reason I'm most optimistic about the future of this movement and the future of our country is because for the first time in a very long time, it is clear that the leader of the Republican party is not some donor who's desperate for cheap labor and it's not some random person who claims to speak for this or that constituency.

We're going to disagree, of course, even within this room about how to best accomplish the reinvigoration of American industry and the renewal of American family.\",\n  \"It doesn't make any sense. It's sort of the perfect encapsulation of the dumbest way to govern our country.
