People like Joe Biden and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer all would agree with Senator Chuck Grassley. No hearing, no, no confirmation in the Senate, no vote in the in the Judiciary Committee, and no vote on the floor of the Senate for this lame duck President's appointments because we have a Constitution that's got to be restored.

He's been prudently using the legal and justifiable, uh, evidence that he had before him, and he's been criticized for his effectiveness by the people that don't want to enforce the law.

He hauled his body out and and put gas and poured gasoline on it and burned this Joshua Wilkerson's body\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"it was another day in, in the life of America and Americans. It's another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here, one who had been encountered by law enforcement officers in the past, one whom I believe ICE declined, uh, to pick up and place into removal proceedings. This happens every day in this country. It happens hundreds of times in this country each year. These incidents of illegal aliens that are, that are arrested and turned loose on the street because the President has this idea of prioritization or prosecutorial discretion is costing lives in America. And it's costing, it's costing in the end thousands of lives in America.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"sad, sad story told by Laura Wilkerson yesterday that she has the courage and the heart to come here and share her story with us and to place that awful, brutal, ghastly memory again into her mind's eye and pour that forth into the Congressional Record so that some of us, some of us will soak that up and be mobilized to do something, something more to resist the President's policy of amnesty, de facto amnesty, amnesty by executive edict, that has been part and parcel of the Obama policy since the beginning of his time here in office. And it's been getting worse and worse every month.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"I thank God for Laura Wilkerson and I ask God to bless the life and the memory and the soul of Joshua Wilkerson who has paid a tremendously high price because we have an ideological president who, I'd say to the other side of the aisle, who's not doing his job. In fact, he's ordering law enforcement officers not to do their job.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"They've become the Welcome Wagon on the southern border.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"Most anybody that gets across there knows, \\\\\\\"If you just claim asylum, uh, you can be, you can be a refugee and this federal government will roll out the Welcome Wagon.\\\\\\\"\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"she is the parent of an anchor baby.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"we grant this de facto permit, this amnesty for the parents of, of anchor babies to be staying free in the United States, that suspends the rule of law, def law, defies the very law, the specified law itself.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"they're utilizing categories or groups of people declaring it to be prosecutorial discretion when in fact it is not prosecutorial discretion because it applies to groups of people created four different groups of people.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"Michelle Rut, the grieving mother of a daughter, 21 years old, who was a 4.0 student at Belleview University. She wanted to become a law enforcement investigator. She had the best grades that you could possibly have, living and loving life.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"an illegal criminal alien drunk driving perpetrator ran her down and rear-ended her in the street and killed Sarah Root. Sarah, Sarah Root, 4.0 student, the world ahead of her, wanting to contribute to this country, to life, to society, living and loving life. Her life abruptly ended by a criminal alien\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"He'd been released onto the streets where he now had three times the blood alcohol content allowable by law, drag racing in the streets, killed Sarah Root.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"all through the rest of her life and her family's life, they will carry this hole, this ache in their heart that didn't need to be. Sarah Root would be alive today if the President had done his job, if law enforcement had been allowed to do their job, if ICE had responded when local law enforcement called them.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"We got ICE who's prohibited from doing their job, who sometimes won't when they want to. Local law enforcement that won't cooperate with ICE because I sent out a letter a year and a half or so ago that said ICE detainers are a recommendation. They're no longer mandatory.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"we have in this confused junk.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"This President has, has released, his administration has released over 30,000 criminals, criminal aliens onto the streets of America. And of those that they released, there have been at least 124 of them who have been charged with homicide for 135 murders. That's 135 dead Americans that would be alive today if the President didn't have the policy of releasing criminal, criminal aliens onto the streets. That's, that's the ones we know of. That's the ones that are the recidivism within a five-year window of time whose names we know, whose incidents we know. But that doesn't include anywhere near all of them\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"this is the face of one of these perpetrators, Mauricio Hernandez. What did he do? Mauricio Hernandez, a sexual predator who impregnated a 13-year-old daughter of his living girlfriend. And took this repeatedly, had sexual relations with her in ways that I won't repeat here on the floor. Took her off to soccer games where he gave. He also gave her an abortion inducing drug. And she went into into a porta pot and had the baby that was alive. And he went in and saw that baby. And this girl was then hauled home. The baby was left to die. That baby died. Mauricio Hernandez is the perpetrator. He's another illegal alien. Another one who had been encountered by law. Another one that had been granted this de facto amnesty because of the President's policy.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"I can stand here, Mr. Speaker, every night I could come here and give you these stats and I can give you the data on the thousands of Americans that are dead at the hands of the criminal aliens that have been incarcerated for a temporary period of time and released by multiple jurisdictions across this country. And every American that dies at their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our laws.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"people over on this side of the aisle have their fingers in their ears on data. But when they see the faces, when they hear the anguish and the voices, especially of the mothers\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"he was out before they could bury his daughter. He was out on $5,000 bail, which was less than it cost him to bury his daughter. And that individual absconded back out of the United States, now not to be reached again by the arm of the law, which is not long enough because they put him out on bail.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"I don't want to see any more bail to criminal aliens. I want to see law enforcement. And I want an expectation that when the law is broken in the United States, that there's going to be an enforcement, that it'll be applied equally without regard to any of these categories that the President encourages us to be members of. That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally. Secure our borders. Restore their respect for the rule of law. Save these lives. Send these people into prison. And when they're done, send them back to the country that they can live in legally for the rest of their lives if they don't stay in our prisons for the rest of their lives.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"this is an infuriating topic that America needs to know a lot more about.\\\"\",\n  \"\\\"I'd ask Mr. Speaker that this country keep the families of these victims in their prayers every day until such time as we rest.\\\"\"\n]\nTotal quotes in analysis result: 55\nTotal quotes in output: 55",
