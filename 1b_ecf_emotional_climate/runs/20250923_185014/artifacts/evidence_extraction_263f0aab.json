And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price.\",\n  \"The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country and they derive their power from dividing working people apart.\",\n  \"lying to and screwing over working and middle class Americans so that they can steal from our healthcare, Social Security, and veterans' benefits to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest and bailouts for their crypto billionaire friends.\",\n  \"But we're smarter than that Greeley. We know better than that.\",\n  \"If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here. If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here.\",\n  \"Because in this house, we stand together, we know that, that it's our only choice because we know that without exception, if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win.\",\n  \"And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price.\",\n  \"Donald Trump does see the immense pressure that working people are under. But his answer is an America that operates on the principle of every man for himself, divide and conquer. And now that Trump is back in power, we see it clear as day. He's handed the keys to Elon Musk and is selling off our country for parts to the wealthiest people in the world for a kickback.\",\n  \"So folks, you know what that means, right? We need to come together and spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors, and give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat who will stand for Colorado.\",\n  \"So to all of those who came here today, unsure of whether this is where you belong, I want to tell you that you do. You do. Honestly, no matter who you voted for in the past. No matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender identity, or status, no matter if you disagree with me on a couple of things. If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here.\",\n  \"If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here.\",\n  \"Because in this house, we stand together, we know that, that it's our only choice because we know that without exception, if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win. So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity.\",\n  \"We are witnessing an oligarchy in America.

And Greeley, there's a word for this kind of thing, corruption.\",\n  \"Now it's this idea that if we just work hard, we too can have nation-state level money, except these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me.\",\n  \"There is no language celebrating others' success, merit, or achievement in this document. The focus is on condemning the 'oligarchy' and 'billionaires' rather than celebrating any positive developments from any group.\"\n]",
