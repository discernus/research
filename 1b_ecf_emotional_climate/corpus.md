# Emotional Climate Factorial Analysis Corpus

This corpus contains political speeches designed for a 2×2 factorial analysis examining emotional climate patterns across ideology and era factors. The corpus spans 60 years of American political discourse (1963-2025) and includes speeches from prominent political figures representing conservative and progressive ideologies across two distinct political eras.

## Corpus Design

The corpus employs a balanced factorial design with:
- **2 Ideological Groups**: Conservative vs Progressive
- **2 Political Eras**: Historical (1963-2020), Contemporary (2017-2025)
- **Total Documents**: 8 speeches (4 Conservative, 4 Progressive)

## Document Overview

### Historical Era (1963-2020)
- **Progressive**: John Lewis - 1963 March on Washington speech
- **Conservative**: John McCain - 2008 Presidential concession speech
- **Conservative**: Mitt Romney - 2020 Senate floor speech on impeachment vote
- **Progressive**: Cory Booker - 2018 Senate floor speech supporting First Step Act

### Contemporary Era (2017-2025)
- **Progressive**: Bernie Sanders - 2025 Senate floor speech criticizing oligarchic power
- **Progressive**: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - 2025 House floor speech on oligarchy
- **Conservative**: JD Vance - 2022 National Conservatism Conference keynote
- **Conservative**: Steve King - 2017 House floor speech on immigration

## Factorial Balance

This design enables sophisticated emotional climate interaction analysis:
- **Ideology × Era Interaction**: Tests whether emotional climate patterns vary systematically across the interaction of ideological affiliation and historical era
- **Main Effects**: Tests for ideological and temporal effects on emotional climate dimensions
- **Statistical Power**: Balanced design maximizes statistical power for detecting interaction effects

## Emotional Climate Dimensions

The corpus is designed to capture variation across six emotional climate dimensions:
1. **Fear/Hope Axis**: Crisis/threat vs. optimism/aspiration
2. **Enmity/Amity Axis**: Opposition/conflict vs. cooperation/unity
3. **Envy/Compersion Axis**: Resentment/comparison vs. shared joy/satisfaction

## Source Attribution

All speeches are sourced from public political discourse including:
- Congressional floor speeches
- Presidential campaign addresses
- Political conference keynotes
- Civil rights movement speeches
