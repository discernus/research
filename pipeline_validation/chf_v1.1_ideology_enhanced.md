# Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v1.1 - Salience Enhanced
## Constitutional System Health Assessment with Salience-Weighted Analysis

---

## What Is This Framework?

The Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v1.1 analyzes how political discourse affects the health and functioning of constitutional systems through **salience-enhanced constitutional assessment**. Drawing on Walter Bagehot's insight that constitutions are living systems of governance rather than mere documents, this framework assesses discourse impact across three fundamental dimensions of constitutional health, **weighted by actual rhetorical emphasis patterns** rather than predetermined assumptions.

**Core Purpose**: CHF reveals whether discourse strengthens or weakens constitutional democracy by analyzing how it treats procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity - regardless of whether the constitution is written or unwritten, American or British, current or future. **Version 1.1 enhancement** captures not just constitutional health/pathology patterns but which constitutional dimensions speakers emphasize most in their rhetorical strategy.

**Version 1.1 Innovation**: **Salience-weighted constitutional analysis** - analyzes not just whether speakers support or threaten constitutional health, but which constitutional dimensions receive the most rhetorical emphasis, enabling empirically-grounded assessment of constitutional discourse priorities.

**Key Applications**:
- **Constitutional Health Monitoring**: Track democratic resilience based on speakers' actual constitutional emphasis patterns
- **Cross-System Comparison**: Compare constitutional impacts using empirically-backed weighting across democratic traditions
- **Historical Analysis**: Assess constitutional threats based on rhetorical priority patterns across political eras
- **Early Warning Systems**: Detect constitutional degradation through constitutional salience pattern analysis

## What is Salience-Enhanced Constitutional Analysis?

### **Salience in Constitutional Discourse**

**Salience** = How much rhetorical emphasis the speaker places on each constitutional dimension, regardless of raw health/pathology scores.

**Key Insight**: A speaker might demonstrate moderate Procedural Legitimacy support (0.6 intensity) consistently throughout their discourse, while only briefly attacking Institutional Respect (1.0 intensity) in one section. The Procedural Legitimacy has much higher **salience** (0.8) than Institutional attacks (0.2) despite lower raw intensity.

**Why This Matters for Constitutional Assessment**:
- **Constitutional Priorities**: Reveals which constitutional dimensions speakers prioritize in their political strategy
- **Strategic Constitutional Discourse**: Shows which constitutional issues speakers invest the most rhetorical effort in addressing
- **Authentic Constitutional Analysis**: Uses actual constitutional emphasis rather than researcher assumptions about dimension importance

### **Enhanced Constitutional Intelligence**

**Traditional Approach**: Focus on presence/absence and intensity of constitutional health/pathology patterns  
**CHF v1.1 Innovation**: **Priority-aware analysis** that captures speakers' constitutional strategy and priorities

**Academic Foundation**:
- **Constitutional Theory**: Speakers make strategic choices about which constitutional issues to emphasize
- **Political Communication Research**: Constitutional emphasis patterns reveal democratic priorities and threats  
- **Democratic Resilience Studies**: Salience analysis enables more sophisticated understanding of constitutional vulnerabilities

### **Dual-Track Constitutional Analysis**

**Track 1**: **Constitutional Health/Pathology** (0.0-1.0) - Traditional constitutional impact measurement  
**Track 2**: **Salience Ranking** (0.0-1.0) - Constitutional emphasis and rhetorical prominence assessment

**Result**: Complete constitutional analysis showing both the impact on constitutional health AND the speaker's constitutional priorities and strategic emphasis patterns.

## Framework Architecture: Salience-Enhanced Constitutional Assessment

### **Three-Dimensional Constitutional Health Analysis**

**Constitutional Health Dimensions**:
1. **Procedural Legitimacy**: Support for established procedures for political change and governance
2. **Institutional Respect**: Recognition of governing authority and institutional effectiveness  
3. **Systemic Continuity**: Support for constitutional adaptation rather than replacement

**Constitutional Pathology Dimensions**:
1. **Procedural Rejection**: Rejection of established procedures in favor of circumvention or force
2. **Institutional Subversion**: Attacks on governing authority and institutional effectiveness
3. **Systemic Replacement**: Calls for constitutional system replacement rather than adaptation

### **Salience-Enhanced Assessment Process**

#### **Step 1: Standard Constitutional Scoring** (0.0-1.0 for each dimension)
- Procedural Legitimacy: 0.7, Procedural Rejection: 0.3, Institutional Respect: 0.5, etc.

#### **Step 2: Salience Ranking Assessment** (prominence evaluation)  
- Procedural Legitimacy: 0.8 salience (emphasized throughout discourse)
- Institutional Respect: 0.6 salience (moderately emphasized)
- Systemic Continuity: 0.3 salience (briefly mentioned)

#### **Step 3: Constitutional Priority Analysis**
**Interpretation**: This speaker's constitutional strategy prioritizes procedural legitimacy and demonstrates moderate institutional support, while giving less rhetorical investment to systemic continuity issues, revealing specific constitutional priorities and strategic emphasis patterns.

### **Salience vs Intensity Distinction in Constitutional Analysis**

**Intensity** = How strongly the constitutional health/pathology pattern appears when demonstrated  
**Salience** = How much rhetorical space and emphasis the constitutional dimension receives

**Example**:
- **High Intensity, Low Salience**: Brief but intense institutional attack (0.9 intensity, 0.2 salience)  
- **Moderate Intensity, High Salience**: Consistent procedural legitimacy language throughout (0.6 intensity, 0.9 salience)

**Constitutional Insight**: Speaker prioritizes procedural legitimacy as central to their constitutional philosophy, while institutional criticism appears more tactical than deeply held constitutional position.

## Constitutional Dimensions with Linguistic Markers

### **Procedural Legitimacy (0.0-1.0) - CONSTITUTIONAL HEALTH**
**Core Concept**: Discourse that treats established procedures for political change as legitimate and authoritative

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:
- **Constitutional Process Language**: "constitutional process," "established procedure," "legal framework," "legitimate process," "proper channels"
- **Precedent Recognition**: "established precedent," "constitutional tradition," "customary practice," "institutional custom," "long-standing procedure"  
- **Process Integrity**: "due process," "procedural fairness," "systematic approach," "transparent procedure," "constitutional safeguards"

### **Procedural Rejection (0.0-1.0) - CONSTITUTIONAL PATHOLOGY**  
**Core Concept**: Discourse rejecting established procedures in favor of circumvention, force, or extra-constitutional action

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:
- **Process Circumvention**: "bypass the system," "go around institutions," "emergency powers," "exceptional measures," "crisis justification"
- **Procedural Dismissal**: "broken system," "failed process," "illegitimate procedure," "corrupt system," "rigged process"
- **Extra-Constitutional Appeals**: "higher law," "natural justice," "people's will," "revolutionary action," "direct action"

### **Institutional Respect (0.0-1.0) - CONSTITUTIONAL HEALTH**
**Core Concept**: Discourse recognizing institutional authority, expertise, and legitimate role in governance

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:
- **Authority Recognition**: "institutional authority," "legitimate government," "constitutional office," "proper jurisdiction," "official capacity"
- **Expertise Acknowledgment**: "expert analysis," "professional judgment," "institutional knowledge," "specialized expertise," "technical competence"
- **Role Recognition**: "separation of powers," "institutional role," "proper function," "constitutional duty," "institutional responsibility"

### **Institutional Subversion (0.0-1.0) - CONSTITUTIONAL PATHOLOGY**
**Core Concept**: Discourse undermining institutional authority, expertise, and legitimate governance role

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:
- **Authority Rejection**: "illegitimate authority," "corrupt institution," "failed institution," "enemy of the people," "deep state"
- **Expertise Dismissal**: "so-called experts," "elite manipulation," "institutional bias," "academic propaganda," "establishment lies"
- **Role Confusion**: "overreach," "abuse of power," "institutional coup," "judicial activism," "bureaucratic control"

### **Systemic Continuity (0.0-1.0) - CONSTITUTIONAL HEALTH**  
**Core Concept**: Discourse supporting constitutional adaptation and evolution within existing framework

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:
- **Adaptive Language**: "constitutional evolution," "system adaptation," "democratic reform," "institutional renewal," "constitutional development"
- **Continuity Emphasis**: "preserve democracy," "maintain system," "protect constitution," "democratic tradition," "institutional heritage"
- **Reform Within System**: "constitutional amendment," "democratic reform," "institutional improvement," "system enhancement," "democratic renewal"

### **Systemic Replacement (0.0-1.0) - CONSTITUTIONAL PATHOLOGY**
**Core Concept**: Discourse calling for replacement of constitutional system rather than reform within existing framework

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:
- **System Rejection**: "failed system," "broken democracy," "corrupt regime," "illegitimate government," "system collapse"
- **Replacement Appeals**: "new system," "revolutionary change," "complete overhaul," "system replacement," "regime change"
- **Revolutionary Language**: "tear down system," "destroy institutions," "revolutionary transformation," "complete reconstruction," "system revolution"

### **Ideological Stance (Categorical) - RESEARCHER-ADDED DIMENSION**
**Core Concept**: This dimension identifies the speaker's apparent ideological commitment. The assessment trusts the analytical agent's expert knowledge to classify the discourse as 'progressive', 'conservative', or 'other' based on its deep understanding of political rhetoric, without relying on a predefined list of keywords. This is a researcher-added dimension for the purpose of testing for potential analytical bias.

      "analysis_prompt": "You are an expert analyst specializing in constitutional health and democratic resilience, with deep knowledge of constitutional theory, democratic institutions, and comparative constitutional systems. Your perspective is grounded in constitutional theory, institutional analysis, and democratic resilience research. Your task is to analyze the provided text using the Constitutional Health Framework v1.1. This framework measures constitutional health and pathology patterns through 6 dimensions: 3 health indicators and 3 pathology indicators. CRITICAL: You must assess both INTENSITY (how strong each pattern is) and SALIENCE (how rhetorically prominent each pattern is) for all dimensions. In addition to the constitutional analysis, you must identify the speaker's overall ideological stance. Classify it as 'progressive', 'conservative', or 'other'. CONSTITUTIONAL HEALTH DIMENSIONS: Procedural Legitimacy (0.0-1.0): Support for established procedures - look for 'constitutional process', 'established procedure', 'legal framework', 'legitimate process', 'proper channels', 'due process', 'procedural fairness', 'constitutional tradition', 'institutional custom', 'procedural protection'. Institutional Respect (0.0-1.0): Recognition of institutional authority - look for 'institutional authority', 'legitimate government', 'constitutional office', 'expert analysis', 'professional judgment', 'separation of powers', 'institutional role', 'constitutional duty', 'proper jurisdiction', 'official capacity'. Systemic Continuity (0.0-1.0): Support for constitutional adaptation - look for 'constitutional evolution', 'system adaptation', 'democratic reform', 'preserve democracy', 'maintain system', 'constitutional amendment', 'institutional improvement', 'democratic renewal', 'constitutional development'. CONSTITUTIONAL PATHOLOGY DIMENSIONS: Procedural Rejection (0.0-1.0): Rejection of established procedures - look for 'bypass the system', 'go around institutions', 'emergency powers', 'broken system', 'failed process', 'illegitimate procedure', 'higher law', 'revolutionary action', 'crisis justification', 'extra-constitutional'. Institutional Subversion (0.0-1.0): Undermining institutional authority - look for 'illegitimate authority', 'corrupt institution', 'failed institution', 'deep state', 'so-called experts', 'elite manipulation', 'overreach', 'abuse of power', 'institutional coup', 'enemy of the people'. Systemic Replacement (0.0-1.0): Calls for system replacement - look for 'failed system', 'broken democracy', 'corrupt regime', 'new system', 'revolutionary change', 'complete overhaul', 'tear down system', 'destroy institutions', 'regime change', 'system revolution'. CRITICAL: After scoring all dimensions for intensity, you MUST rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each constitutional dimension is to the overall discourse, regardless of intensity score. Consider: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, thematic centrality, and discourse prominence. SALIENCE ≠ INTENSITY. A dimension can have moderate intensity (0.5) but high salience (0.9) if it's rhetorically central throughout the discourse. For each dimension: 1. Score intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 based on constitutional pattern strength and frequency 2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and discourse emphasis 3. Identify at least 2 direct quotations supporting your assessment 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity. Focus on constitutional health and pathology patterns and strategic constitutional priorities revealed through salience analysis."
