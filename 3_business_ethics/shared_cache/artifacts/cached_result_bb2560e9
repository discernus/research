      "description": "The prose section of the corpus manifest (`corpus.md`) lists and describes 18 distinct documents. However, the machine-readable YAML appendix within the same file specifies `total_documents: 4` and only lists 4 documents in its manifest. The experiment's `sample_size` in `experiment.md` is also set to 4, aligning with the machine-readable manifest but not the corpus description.",
      "impact": "The experiment will only execute on 4 documents, contradicting the broader scope of 18 documents described in the corpus's human-readable overview. This critical mismatch makes the research design misleading and unreproducible as documented.",
      "fix": "Reconcile the prose and YAML sections of `corpus.md`. Either: 1) Expand the YAML manifest to include all 18 documents and update `total_documents` accordingly, also updating the `sample_size` in `experiment.md`. Or 2) Reduce the prose description in `corpus.md` to only describe the 4 documents actually included in the analysis.",

      "description": "The experiment pairs a comprehensive 10-dimension framework with a small corpus of 4 documents. While this is acceptable for the stated \"Case Study Approach\", this small sample size provides limited data to robustly test all dimensions and derived metrics, especially those designed to detect complex patterns and strategic contradictions.",
      "impact": "The analysis may not fully exercise or validate the framework's more complex capabilities. Conclusions about the prevalence of certain patterns or the utility of metrics like the `corporate_responsibility_contradiction_index` will be based on very limited evidence.",
      "fix": "Acknowledge this limitation in the experiment design. For a more robust validation of the framework itself, consider expanding the corpus to provide a wider range of ethical positioning examples. If the focus is purely on the case study, the setup is adequate but the findings' generalizability is limited.",
