      "description": "The corpus manifest YAML contains 'version: \"10.0\"' and 'spec_version: \"8.0.2\"'. While not a strict violation, using '10.0' for the corpus content version is potentially confusing as it matches the framework and experiment specification version. Standard practice is to use a separate versioning scheme for the corpus content itself (e.g., '1.0', '1.1').",
      "impact": "This may cause confusion for future researchers trying to understand the provenance and versioning of the corpus content, as it appears to be tied to the framework spec version rather than its own lifecycle.",
      "fix": "Consider changing the 'version' field in the corpus manifest YAML to a version number specific to the corpus content, such as '1.0', to distinguish it from the specification versions of other components.",

      "description": "The prose description for the 'Salience-Weighted Strategic Ethics' derived metric in framework.md is slightly ambiguous compared to its formula. The prose states '(Sustainable Purpose \u00d7 Salience - Short Term Extraction \u00d7 Salience) / Total Salience', while the formula correctly implements this by multiplying each dimension's score by its own salience. The prose description could be more precise.",
      "impact": "The current prose is unlikely to cause execution errors but could be misinterpreted by a human reader. Improving clarity enhances the framework's reusability and understandability.",
      "fix": "Update the prose description for 'Salience-Weighted Strategic Ethics' in framework.md to more clearly define the calculation, for example: 'This metric calculates the weighted difference between sustainable purpose and short-term extraction, where each dimension's score is weighted by its own salience.'",

      "description": "The experiment specifies a sample size of N=4. According to the v10.0 Experiment Specification, this sample size is only appropriate for 'Case study analysis, qualitative patterns, individual document insights'. The 'Expected Outcomes' largely align with this, but the claim of 'Validation of stakeholder theory and virtue ethics approaches' may be overstated for a 4-document case study.",
      "impact": "While the experiment can proceed as a case study, the small sample size severely limits the generalizability of the findings. Any claims of 'validation' in a broad sense would be statistically unsupported.",
      "fix": "For clarity and to manage expectations, consider rephrasing the outcome from 'Validation of...' to 'Exploration of...' or 'Case study illustration of stakeholder theory...' to better reflect the qualitative, case-study nature of the analysis.",
