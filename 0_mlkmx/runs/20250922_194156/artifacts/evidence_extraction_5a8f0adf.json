And if you're black and you not thinking black at this late date, well, I'm sorry for you.\"\n4. \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: It'll take black nationalism today to remove colonialism from the backs and the minds of twenty-two million Afro-Americans here in this country].\"\n5. \"We have injected ourselves into the civil rights struggle. And we intend to expand it from the level of civil rights to the level of [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: human rights].\"\n6. \"Now you tell me how can the plight of everybody on this Earth reach the halls of the United Nations and you have [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: twenty-two million Afro-Americans whose churches are being bombed, whose little girls are being murdered, whose leaders are being shot down in broad daylight]?\"\n7. \"Whenever you got a [FEAR: racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap]. When a racial powder keg goes off, it doesn't care who it knocks out the way. Understand this, it's dangerous.\"\n8. \"I hope that the white man can see this. 'Cause [FEAR: if you don't see it you're finished]. If you don't see it you're going to become involved in some action in which you don't have a chance.\"\n9. \"Anytime you find the [FEAR: government involved in a conspiracy to violate the citizenship or the civil rights of a people in 1964], then you are wasting your time going to that government expecting redress.\"\n10. \"And you and I have to make a start. And the best place to start is right in the community where we live. [HOPE: So our people not only have to be reeducated to the importance of supporting black business, but the black man himself has to be made aware of the importance of going into business].\"\n11. \"This is what you and I need to get with. And the only time \u2013 the only way we're going to solve our problem is with a [HOPE: self-help program], a do-it-yourself philosophy, a do-it-right-now philosophy, a it's-already-too-late philosophy. This is what you and I need to get with. And the only time \u2013 the only way we're going to solve our problem is with a self-help program. Before we can get a self-help program started, we have to have a self-help philosophy. Black nationalism is a self-help philosophy.\"\n12. \"All she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything. [HOPE: I hope that the white man can see this].\"\n13. \"The white man, the white man is too intelligent to let someone else come and gain control of the economy of his community. But [ENVY: you will let anybody come in and control the economy of your community, control the housing, control the education, control the jobs, control the businesses], under the pretext that you want to integrate. Nah, you're out of your mind.\"\n14. \"And because these Negroes, who have been misled, misguided, are breaking their necks to take their money and spend it with the Man, [ENVY: the Man is becoming richer and richer, and you're becoming poorer and poorer].\"\n15. \"He tells you, [ENVY: I'm for separation and you for integration, and keep us fighting with each other]. No, I'm not for separation and you're not for integration, what you and I are for is freedom.\"\n16. \"None\"\n17. \"Mr. Moderator, Rev. Cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and [ENMITY: I see some enemies].\"\n18. \"Anytime you have to rely upon your [ENMITY: enemy] for a job, you're in bad shape. When you \u2014 and [ENMITY: he is your enemy]. You wouldn't be in this country if some [ENMITY: enemy hadn't kidnapped you and brought you here].\"\n19. \"Not only is he a [ENMITY: crook], he's a [ENMITY: hypocrite]. Here he is standing up in front of other people, Uncle Sam, with the blood of your and mine mothers and fathers on his hands. With the [ENMITY: blood dripping down his jaws like a bloody-jawed wolf].\"\n20. \"So today, though Islam is my religious philosophy, my political, economic and social philosophy is black nationalism. You and I \u2013 [AMITY: As I say, if we bring up religion, we'll have differences, we'll have arguments, and we'll never be able to get together. But if we keep our religion at home, keep our religion in the closet, keep our religion between ourselves and our God, but when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us against a enemy who is common to all of us].\"\n21. \"So I say in my conclusion, the only way we're going to solve it: [AMITY: we got to unite. We got to work together in unity and harmony. And black nationalism is the key].\"\n22. \"Join any kind of organization \u2013 civic, religious, fraternal, political or otherwise that's based on [AMITY: lifting the black man up and making him master of his own community].\"\n23. \"The political philosophy of black nationalism only means that the [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community].\"\n24. \"The economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we should own and operate and control the economy of our community].\"\n25. \"[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Revolutions overturn systems. Revolutions destroy systems].\"\n26. \"The political philosophy of black nationalism only means that we will have to carry on a program, a political program, of reeducation \u2013 to open our people's eyes, make us become more politically conscious, politically mature. And then, we will \u2013 whenever we are ready to cast our ballot, that ballot will be cast for a man of the community, who has the [COHESIVE_GOALS: good of the community at heart].\"\n27. \"What we will be doing is developing a situation, wherein, we will actually be able to [COHESIVE_GOALS: create employment for the people in the community].\"\n28. \"So I say in my conclusion, the only way we're going to solve it: [COHESIVE_GOALS: we got to unite.
