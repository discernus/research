And it will take black nationalism to bring about the freedom of 22 million Afro-Americans, here in this country, where we have suffered colonialism for the past 400 years.\",\n  \"We have injected ourselves into the civil rights struggle. And we intend to expand it from the level of civil rights to the level of human rights.\",\n  \"This is why I say it's the ballot or the bullet. It's liberty or it's death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody.\",\n  \"You don't take your case to the criminal, you take your criminal to court.\",\n  \"Whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap. When a racial powder keg goes off, it doesn't care who it knocks out the way. Understand this, it's dangerous.\",\n  \"We suffer political oppression, economic exploitation and social degradation. All of 'em from the same enemy. The government has failed us.\",\n  \"If you're black, you were born in jail. ... No, you're nothing but a 20th century slave.\",\n  \"And in 1964, this seems to be the year. ... in their frustrations they want action. And in 1964 you'll see this young black man, this new generation, asking for the ballot or the bullet.\",\n  \"And the gospel of black nationalism, as I told you, means you should control your own, the politics of your community, the economy of your community, and all of the society in which you live should be under your control.\",\n  \"If you see where the NAACP is preaching and practicing that which is designed to make black nationalism materialize, join the NAACP. Join any kind of organization \u2013 civic, religious, fraternal, political or otherwise that's based on lifting the black man up and making him master of his own community.\",\n  \"The Man is becoming richer and richer, and you're becoming poorer and poorer.\",\n  \"You're in a position to determine who'll go to the White House and who'll stay in the doghouse.\",\n  \"America is just as much a colonial power as England ever was. ... In fact, America is more so a colonial power than they, because she is a hypocritical colonial power behind it. ... No, you're nothing but a 20th century slave.\",\n  \"The success of other nations in Asia and Africa gaining independence through nationalism is referenced, not as celebration of their inherent success but as a model for Black Americans. No textual evidence directly showing joy for the success of *other* groups (e.g., white community or existing systems).\",\n  \"There is no clear textual evidence to suggest joy from the success of an 'other' group, given the highly adversarial 'us vs. them' framing.\",\n  \"The speech focuses on Black self-reliance and empowerment, not celebrating the achievements of external groups, especially those depicted as oppressors.\",\n  \"Mr. Moderator, Rev. Cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and I see some enemies.\",\n  \"We're all in the same bag, in the same boat. All of us catch hell from the same enemy.\",\n  \"Not only is he a crook, he's a hypocrite. Here he is standing up in front of other people, Uncle Sam, with the blood of your and mine mothers and fathers on his hands. With the blood dripping down his jaws like a bloody-jawed wolf.\",\n  \"Mr. Moderator, Rev. Cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and I see some enemies.\",\n  \"So I say in my conclusion, the only way we're going to solve it: we got to unite. We got to work together in unity and harmony. And black nationalism is the key.\",\n  \"I'm not for separation and you're not for integration, what you and I are for is freedom. ... We both got the same objective, we just got different ways of getting' at it.\",\n  \"The political philosophy of black nationalism only means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community.\",\n  \"Revolutions overturn systems. Revolutions destroy systems.\",\n  \"Just as it took nationalism to remove colonialism from Asia and Africa, it'll take black nationalism today to remove colonialism from the backs and the minds of twenty-two million Afro-Americans here in this country.\",\n  \"And once you and I go into business, we own and operate at least the businesses in our community. What we will be doing is developing a situation, wherein, we will actually be able to create employment for the people in the community.\",\n  \"This is a philosophy that eliminates the necessity for division and argument, 'cause if you're black, you should be thinking black.\",\n  \"Join any kind of organization \u2013 civic, religious, fraternal, political or otherwise that's based on lifting the black man up and making him master of his own community.\"\n]\nTotal number of quotes in the analysis result: 30\nTotal number of quotes in the output: 30",
