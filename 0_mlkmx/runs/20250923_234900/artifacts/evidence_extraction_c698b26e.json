When a racial powder keg goes off, it doesn't care who it knocks out the way. Understand this, it's dangerous.\",\n  \"If you don't see it you're finished. If you don't see it you're going to become involved in some action in which you don't have a chance.\",\n  \"They'll lynch in Texas as quick as they'll lynch you in Mississippi.
