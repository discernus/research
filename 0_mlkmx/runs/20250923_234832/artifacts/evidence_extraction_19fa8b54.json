Any law that degrades human personality is unjust.\",\n  \"in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality.\",\n  \"Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.\",\n  \"vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters\",\n  \"smothering in an airtight cage of poverty\",\n  \"ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky\",\n  \"plagued with inner fears and outer resentments\",\n  \"a frightening racial nightmare\",\n  \"our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us.\",\n  \"They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment.\",\n  \"I have no despair about the future.
