    "This is a high-quality, coherent experiment setup. The framework, corpus, and experiment specifications are internally consistent, adhere to v10.0 standards, and demonstrate best practices such as providing sequential analysis variants and implementing defensive calculations for derived metrics. The chosen analytical method (comparative case analysis) is perfectly aligned with the corpus size (N=2)."
