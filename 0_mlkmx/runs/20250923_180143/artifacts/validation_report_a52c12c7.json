      "description": "The framework's `analysis_prompt` instructs the LLM agent to return `derived_metrics`, which are also defined for deterministic calculation by the system in `required_calculations`. This creates ambiguity about which component is responsible for the calculation and could lead to inconsistent or erroneous derived metric values if the LLM makes a mathematical error.",
      "impact": "The final dataset might contain derived metrics calculated by the non-deterministic LLM instead of the reliable system calculator, compromising analytical integrity. The robust path is for the system to perform all calculations based on raw scores.",
      "fix": "Update the `analysis_prompt` in `framework.md` to instruct the LLM to provide only the `dimensional_scores`. The system's orchestration layer should be the single source of truth for performing all calculations defined in the `required_calculations` section.",
