America is just as much a colonial power as France ever was. In fact, America is more so a colonial power than they, because she is a hypocritical colonial power behind it.]\",\n  \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We have injected ourselves into the civil rights struggle. And we intend to expand it from the level of civil rights to the level of human rights.]\",\n  \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Chief Justice Goldberg was crying over three million Jews in Russia, about their human rights \u2013 charging Russia with violating the U.N. Charter because of its mistreatment of the human rights of Jews in Russia.]\",\n  \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: full rights, that's the government that's responsible.]\",\n  \"[FEAR: In fact, I think we'd be fooling ourselves if we had an audience this large and didn't realize that there were some enemies present.]\",\n  \"[FEAR: So we're trapped, trapped, double-trapped, triple-trapped. Any way we go, we find that we're trapped. Any every kind of solution that someone comes up with is just another trap.]\",\n  \"[FEAR: And all of this has built up frustrations in the black community that makes the black community throughout America today more explosive than all of the atomic bombs the Russians can ever invent. Whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap. When a racial powder keg goes off, it doesn't care who it knocks out the way. Understand this, it's dangerous.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: What we will be doing is developing a situation, wherein, we will actually be able to create employment for the people in the community.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: You're the one who has that power. You can keep Johnson in Washington D.C., or you can send him back to his Texas cotton patch.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: All she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything.]\",\n  \"[ENVY: The time when white people can come in our community and get us to vote for them so that they can be our political leaders and tell us what to do and what not to do is long gone.]\",\n  \"[ENVY: The white man, the white man is too intelligent to let someone else come and gain control of the economy of his community. But you will let anybody come in and control the economy of your community, control the housing, control the education, control the jobs, control the businesses, under the pretext that you want to integrate. Nah, you're out of your mind.]\",\n  \"[ENVY: And because these Negroes, who have been misled, misguided, are breaking their necks to take their money and spend it with the Man, the Man is becoming richer and richer, and you're becoming poorer and poorer.]\",\n  \"[ENMITY: Mr. Moderator, Rev. Cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and I see some enemies.]\",\n  \"[ENMITY: But if we keep our religion at home, keep our religion in the closet, keep our religion between ourselves and our God, but when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us against a enemy who is common to all of us.]\",\n  \"[ENMITY: So this government has failed us. The government itself has failed us. And the white liberals who have been posing as our friends have failed us.]\",\n  \"[AMITY: So I say in my conclusion, the only way we're going to solve it: we got to unite. We got to work together in unity and harmony.]\",\n  \"[AMITY: We both got the same objective, we just got different ways of getting' at it.]\",\n  \"[AMITY: So today our people are disillusioned. They've become disenchanted. They've become dissatisfied. And in their frustrations they want action.]\",\n  \"[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The ballot or the bullet.]\",\n  \"[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Revolutions overturn systems. Revolutions destroy systems.]\",\n  \"[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: So it's the, it's the ballot or the bullet. Today, our people can see that we're faced with a government conspiracy.]\",\n  \"[COHESIVE_GOALS: So the political philosophy of black nationalism only means that we will have to carry on a program, a political program, of reeducation \u2013 to open our people's eyes, make us become more politically conscious, politically mature.]\",\n  \"[COHESIVE_GOALS: We need a self-help program, a do-it-yourself philosophy, a do-it-right-now philosophy, a it's-already-too-late philosophy. This is what you and I need to get with.]\",\n  \"[COHESIVE_GOALS: Join any kind of organization \u2013 civic, religious, fraternal, political or otherwise that's based on lifting the black man up and making him master of his own community.]\"\n]\nTotal number of quotes in the composite analysis: 27\nTotal number of quotes in your output: 27",
