      "description": "The framework specification uses a non-standard top-level key `required_calculations` in its YAML appendix to define derived metrics. The v10.0 framework specification standard indicates this section should be a list under the key `derived_metrics`. While the content under `required_calculations` is well-structured, this deviation from the standard could be missed by a parser expecting the standard key.",
      "impact": "If the analysis pipeline's parser is strictly implemented to the v10.0 specification, it may not find the formulas for the derived metrics, leading to incomplete analysis results. The experiment would run but the derived cohesion and tension indices would be missing.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, rename the top-level YAML key `required_calculations` to `derived_metrics` and ensure its structure is a list of metric objects, to align with the v10.0 framework specification. Given the existing nested structure, the simplest compliant change would be to rename the key to `derived_metrics` and convert the top-level objects (e.g., `tension_indices`, `final_indices`) into a flat list of individual metric definitions.",
