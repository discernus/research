Here are detailed instructions for analysis agents to implement the Van der Veen 2019 replication experiment using the PDAF v1.3 Tension Enhanced framework:

1. Data Extraction Agent Instructions:

- Extract full text content from each of the 7 specified corpus documents, preserving speech/document metadata.
- Clean and normalize the extracted text, removing any formatting artifacts or non-relevant content.
- Prepare a structured dataset with document ID, speaker/source, date, and full text content for each asset.
- Ensure the dataset is properly formatted for ingestion by the Analysis Agent.

2. Analysis Agent Instructions:

- For each document in the prepared dataset:
  1. Conduct a full PDAF v1.3 Tension Enhanced analysis as specified in the framework.
  2. Score all 9 populist anchors for both intensity (0.0-2.0) and salience (0.0-1.0).
  3. Provide at least 2 direct quotations supporting each populist anchor assessment.
  4. Calculate the 3 populist strategic tensions:
     - Democratic-Authoritarian Tension
     - Internal-External Focus Tension
     - Crisis-Elite Attribution Tension
  5. Compute the Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI).
  6. Classify the populist strategy pattern based on the PSCI score.
  7. Assess the Populist Salience Concentration.
  8. Determine the Economic Direction Indicator.
  9. Identify the primary Populist Strategic Focus based on salience rankings.

- Pay special attention to:
  - Differences between candidate speeches and party platforms
  - Variations in populist patterns between Republican and Democratic sources
  - Strategic tensions unique to each speaker/document

- Ensure all output adheres to the specified JSON schema in the framework's output contract.

3. Calculation Agent Instructions:

- Aggregate results from the Analysis Agent outputs:
  1. Calculate average Populist Intensity Index scores for:
     - All Trump speeches
     - All Sanders speeches
     - Cruz speech
     - Republican Party Platform
     - Democratic Party Platform
  2. Compute mean PSCI scores for the same groupings.
  3. Identify the most common Populist Strategic Focus for each group.
  4. Calculate the and salience for each populist anchor across all documents.
  5. Determine the overall distribution of populist strategy classifications.

- Prepare summary statistics and data visualizations to highlight:. Synthesis Agent Instructions:

- Compare PDAF v1.3 results to Van der Veen 2019 findings:
  1. Assess alignment on basic populist/non-populist classifications.
  2. Identify areas where PDAF v1.3 provides additional insights.
  3. Evaluate how tension analysis extends the original study's conclusions.

- Address the research questions specified in the experiment:
  - Replicate Van der Veen's populist classifications
  - Describe emerging strategic tension patterns
  - Compare Republican vs Democratic populist coherence
  - Contrast candidate speeches with party platforms
  - platform populist patterns
  - Highlight insights uniquely enabled by tension analysis through tension analysis

- Evaluate experiment success based on specified metrics:
  - Basic replication of Van der Veen classifications
  - Methodological extension through tension analysis
  - Research contribution via strategic communication insights

- Synthesize key findings into a cohesive narrative, focusing on:
  - Replication success and validation of PDAF v1.3
  - Novel insights enabled by tension-enhanced analysis
  - Theoreticalist discourse theory and future research directions

- Prepare a summary suitable for academic publication, including:
  - Methodology comparison (Van der Veen vs PDAF v1.3)
  - Key findings and their significance
  - Limitations of the current study
  - Recommendations for further populist discourse analysis using PDAF v1.3

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
# Archived Documentation - January 17, 2025

## What Was Archived

**Directory**: `pm/soar/` (moved to `deprecated/by-date/2025-01-17/soar/`)

**Contents**:
- `soar_v1/` - Original SOAR v1.0 specifications and documentation
- `soar_v2/` - SOAR v2.0 specifications and methodology
- `frameworks/` - SOAR-specific framework implementations

## Why Archived

As part of the **Documentation Refactoring Plan Phase 6**, SOAR-specific documentation was archived because:

1. **Terminology Absorbed**: SOAR concepts have been absorbed into the main Discernus platform documentation
2. **Domain-Neutral Focus**: Platform documentation now uses domain-neutral language rather than SOAR-specific terminology  
3. **Strategic Coherence**: Eliminates scattered PM documents that created conflicting visions
4. **THIN Compliance**: Consolidates documentation to prevent agent drift toward THICK patterns

## Migration Path

**SOAR concepts integrated into**:
- `docs/PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` - Multi-agent orchestration principles
- `docs/DISCERNUS_STRATEGIC_VISION.md` - Adversarial review and transparency principles
- `docs/CORE_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md` - Agent registry and coordination patterns

## Access

This archived documentation remains available for historical reference but is no longer actively maintained. All active development should reference the current documentation in the `docs/` directory.

**Archive Date**: January 17, 2025  
**Refactoring Phase**: Phase 6 - Final Consolidation & Cleanup
