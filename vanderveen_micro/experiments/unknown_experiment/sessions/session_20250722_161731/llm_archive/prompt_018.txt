Here are detailed instructions for analysis agents to implement the Van der Veen 2019 replication experiment using the PDAF v1.3 Tension Enhanced framework:

1. Data Extraction Agent Instructions:

- Extract full text content from each of the 7 specified corpus documents, preserving speech/document metadata.
- Clean and normalize the extracted text, removing any formatting artifacts or non-relevant content.
- Prepare a structured dataset with document ID, speaker/source, date, and full text content for each asset.
- Ensure the dataset is properly formatted for ingestion by the Analysis Agent.

2. Analysis Agent Instructions:

- For each document in the prepared dataset:
  1. Conduct a full PDAF v1.3 Tension Enhanced analysis as specified in the framework.
  2. Score all 9 populist anchors for both intensity (0.0-2.0) and salience (0.0-1.0).
  3. Provide at least 2 direct quotations supporting each populist anchor assessment.
  4. Calculate the 3 populist strategic tensions:
     - Democratic-Authoritarian Tension
     - Internal-External Focus Tension
     - Crisis-Elite Attribution Tension
  5. Compute the Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI).
  6. Classify the populist strategy pattern based on the PSCI score.
  7. Assess the Populist Salience Concentration.
  8. Determine the Economic Direction Indicator.
  9. Identify the primary Populist Strategic Focus based on salience rankings.

- Pay special attention to:
  - Differences between candidate speeches and party platforms
  - Variations in populist patterns between Republican and Democratic sources
  - Strategic tensions unique to each speaker/document

- Ensure all output adheres to the specified JSON schema in the framework's output contract.

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
# MECE Trinity Integration Strategies
## Post-Hoc Analysis and Multi-Framework Research Designs

---

## Executive Summary

The MECE Trinity architecture enables flexible, modular analysis where researchers can combine frameworks based on specific research questions. This document provides strategic guidance for integrating ECF v1.0, Enhanced PDAF v1.2, and CVF v4.1 in various research configurations.

**Core Principle**: Frameworks operate independently but provide exponentially more insight when strategically combined.

---

## Framework Integration Matrix

### Single Framework Applications

#### ECF v1.0 (Emotional Climate) - Standalone
**Research Questions**:
- How does emotional climate vary across media platforms?
- What emotional atmosphere do different policy domains create?
- How has political emotional climate changed over time?

**Methodology**: Pure emotional assessment without character or rhetoric considerations
**Output**: Emotional climate profiles and temporal trends

#### Enhanced PDAF v1.2 (Rhetoric + Institutions) - Standalone  
**Research Questions**:
- How prevalent is populist rhetoric in different political systems?
- Do populist movements channel democratically or antidemocratically?
- What institutional effects result from different rhetorical strategies?

**Methodology**: Populist pattern detection with institutional direction assessment
**Output**: Populist typology and democratic health impact

#### CVF v4.1 (Speaker Character) - Standalone
**Research Questions**:
- What character traits predict effective democratic leadership?
- How does moral character vary across political roles?
- Which virtues and vices correlate with electoral success?

**Methodology**: Character assessment through virtue-vice analysis
**Output**: Leadership character profiles and fitness assessment

---

## Dual Framework Integrations

### ECF + CVF: Character-Climate Analysis
**Research Question**: "How does speaker character relate to emotional climate creation?"

**Analytical Approach**:
1. Assess speaker character independently (CVF)
2. Assess emotional climate independently (ECF)  
3. Correlate character dimensions with climate dimensions
4. Identify character-climate patterns

**Example Hypotheses**:
- H1: Speakers high in CVF "Tribalism" create higher ECF "Enmity" climates
- H2: Speakers high in CVF "Hope" create higher ECF "Hope" climates  
- H3: Speakers high in CVF "Manipulation" create more intense emotional climates overall

**Statistical Analysis**: Correlation matrices, regression analysis, cluster analysis

### ECF + PDAF: Climate-Rhetoric Analysis
**Research Question**: "How does rhetorical strategy relate to emotional climate?"

**Analytical Approach**:
1. Detect populist rhetoric patterns independently (PDAF)
2. Assess emotional climate independently (ECF)
3. Analyze rhetoric-climate relationships
4. Identify strategy-climate combinations

**Example Hypotheses**:
- H1: Higher PDAF "Crisis-Restoration" correlates with higher ECF "Fear"
- H2: Higher PDAF "Democratic Engagement" correlates with lower ECF "Enmity"
- H3: Populist rhetoric intensity correlates with overall emotional intensity

**Applications**: Campaign message optimization, media effect analysis

### CVF + PDAF: Character-Strategy Analysis  
**Research Question**: "How does speaker character relate to rhetorical strategy choice?"

**Analytical Approach**:
1. Assess speaker character independently (CVF)
2. Detect rhetorical strategies independently (PDAF)
3. Correlate character with strategy choices
4. Identify character-strategy profiles

**Example Hypotheses**:
- H1: Speakers high in CVF "Tribalism" use more PDAF populist rhetoric
- H2: Speakers high in CVF "Virtue Cluster" channel more democratically
- H3: CVF "Manipulation" predicts PDAF "Antidemocratic Circumvention"

**Applications**: Leadership evaluation, candidate assessment, political ethics research
