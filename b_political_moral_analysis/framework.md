## Moral Foundations Theory Core Analysis

*[Preserving all existing MFT v4.1 functionality with tension enhancement]*

### **Six Foundation Pairs: Independent Scoring with Tension Analysis**

**Individualizing Foundations (Foundation Pairs 1-2)**:
1. **Care** (0.0-1.0): Compassion, protection, suffering prevention
2. **Harm** (0.0-1.0): Cruelty concern, violence prevention, victim advocacy

3. **Fairness** (0.0-1.0): Justice, equality, proportional treatment  
4. **Cheating** (0.0-1.0): Unfairness concern, exploitation prevention, corruption focus

**Binding Foundations (Foundation Pairs 3-5)**:
5. **Loyalty** (0.0-1.0): Group cohesion, fidelity, solidarity
6. **Betrayal** (0.0-1.0): Group abandonment concern, treachery prevention

7. **Authority** (0.0-1.0): Hierarchy respect, tradition, legitimate order
8. **Subversion** (0.0-1.0): Rebellion concern, tradition undermining, hierarchy disruption

9. **Sanctity** (0.0-1.0): Sacred preservation, purity, transcendence  
10. **Degradation** (0.0-1.0): Contamination concern, profane prevention, sacred violation

**Liberty Foundation (Foundation Pair 6)**:
11. **Liberty** (0.0-1.0): Freedom, autonomy, self-determination
12. **Oppression** (0.0-1.0): Control concern, domination prevention, freedom protection

## Revolutionary Moral Tension Mathematics (v4.2 Enhancement)

### **Moral Foundation Tension Scoring**

**Formula**: `Moral Tension = min(Foundation_score, Opposition_score) Ã— |Foundation_salience - Opposition_salience|`

**MFT Foundation Opposing Pairs**:
1. **Care-Harm Tension**: `min(care_score, harm_score) Ã— |care_salience - harm_salience|`
2. **Fairness-Cheating Tension**: `min(fairness_score, cheating_score) Ã— |fairness_salience - cheating_salience|`  
3. **Loyalty-Betrayal Tension**: `min(loyalty_score, betrayal_score) Ã— |loyalty_salience - betrayal_salience|`
4. **Authority-Subversion Tension**: `min(authority_score, subversion_score) Ã— |authority_salience - subversion_salience|`
5. **Sanctity-Degradation Tension**: `min(sanctity_score, degradation_score) Ã— |sanctity_salience - degradation_salience|`
6. **Liberty-Oppression Tension**: `min(liberty_score, oppression_score) Ã— |liberty_salience - oppression_salience|`

### **Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI)**

**Formula**: `MSCI = (Sum of all Moral Tension Scores) / Number of Foundation Pairs`

```
MSCI = (Care_Harm_Tension + Fairness_Cheating_Tension + Loyalty_Betrayal_Tension + 
        Authority_Subversion_Tension + Sanctity_Degradation_Tension + Liberty_Oppression_Tension) / 6
```

### **Moral Foundation Tension Pattern Classification**

**MSCI Moral Coherence Assessment**:
- **0.00-0.12**: **Moral Coherence** - Consistent moral foundation priorities across all dimensions
- **0.13-0.25**: **Moral Complexity** - Moderate moral tensions with sophisticated foundation management
- **0.26-0.38**: **Moral Ambivalence** - Significant moral contradictions requiring interpretation  
- **0.39+**: **Moral Contradiction** - High tension from competing moral foundation claims

### **Advanced Moral Analytics**

**Moral Salience Concentration**: `MSC = Standard Deviation of Moral Foundation Salience Scores`
- **Focused Moral Identity** (MSC > 0.3): Clear moral foundation priorities
- **Distributed Moral Identity** (MSC < 0.2): Broad moral engagement across foundations

**Moral Tension-Salience Interaction Effects**:
- **High Moral Focus + Low MSCI**: Authentic moral identity with clear foundation priorities
- **High Moral Focus + High MSCI**: Moral identity confusion with competing foundation emphases  
- **Low Moral Focus + Low MSCI**: Sophisticated moral complexity with coherent foundation integration
- **Low Moral Focus + High MSCI**: Inconsistent moral reasoning across different foundation contexts

### **Moral Foundation Architecture Analysis**

**Individualizing vs Binding Foundation Balance**:
- **Care-Fairness Emphasis**: Liberal moral profile with low binding foundation tension
- **Loyalty-Authority-Sanctity Emphasis**: Conservative moral profile with low individualizing tension
- **Balanced Foundation Emphasis**: Complex moral reasoning across foundation categories

**Foundation-Specific Tension Patterns**:
- **Care-Harm Tension**: Compassion vs harm prevention emphasis contradictions
- **Liberty-Authority Tension**: Freedom vs order moral reasoning conflicts
- **Fairness-Loyalty Tension**: Justice vs group fidelity priority conflicts

## Enhanced Moral Foundation Agent Integration

### **Moral-Tension-Aware Analysis Instructions**

**Critical Enhancement**: Agents now assess both traditional moral foundation patterns AND moral contradiction patterns:

1. **Standard Foundation Scoring**: Foundation intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience (0.0-1.0) assessment for all 12 foundations
2. **Moral Tension Calculation**: Automated computation of 6 foundation pair tension scores  
3. **MSCI Assessment**: Moral Strategic Contradiction Index with moral coherence classification
4. **Moral Identity Analysis**: Salience concentration effects on moral reasoning consistency

**Agent Prompt Enhancement**: *"After completing traditional MFT moral foundation analysis, calculate moral tensions for all 6 foundation opposing pairs using the formula: min(foundation_score, opposition_score) Ã— |foundation_salience - opposition_salience|. Compute the Moral Strategic Contradiction Index as the average of all tension scores. Assess whether the speaker demonstrates coherent moral reasoning or exhibits moral foundation contradictions."*

This framework now includes breakthrough moral tension pattern analysis in addition to traditional moral foundation assessment. The framework evaluates moral reasoning through 6 foundation pairs (12 total foundations) plus moral contradiction analysis. Focus on moral reasoning patterns and foundation priorities demonstrated in discourse. MORAL FOUNDATIONS (score 0.0-1.0): Care Foundation: Compassion, protection, suffering prevention - look for 'protect', 'care', 'compassion', 'sympathy', 'kindness', 'help', 'support', 'vulnerable', protection language. Harm Foundation: Cruelty concern, violence prevention - look for 'harm', 'hurt', 'violence', 'cruelty', 'abuse', 'suffering', 'victim', 'innocent', harm prevention. Fairness Foundation: Justice, equality, proportionality - look for 'fair', 'just', 'equal', 'rights', 'deserve', 'justice', 'equality', 'proportional', fairness appeals. Cheating Foundation: Unfairness concern, exploitation prevention - look for 'unfair', 'cheat', 'exploit', 'corrupt', 'fraud', 'discriminate', 'bias', unfairness concern. Loyalty Foundation: Group cohesion, fidelity - look for 'loyalty', 'solidarity', 'unity', 'team', 'group', 'allegiance', 'bond', 'commitment', group fidelity.

Oppression Foundation: Control concern, domination prevention - look for 'oppress', 'control', 'dominate', 'coerce', 'force', 'suppress', 'tyranny', oppression concern. CRITICAL: After scoring all foundations, you MUST rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each moral foundation is to the overall moral reasoning, regardless of score magnitude. Consider: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, thematic centrality, and discourse prominence in moral appeals. SALIENCE â‰  INTENSITY. For each foundation: 1. Score moral intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 based on frequency, centrality, and strength 2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and emphasis in moral reasoning 3. Identify at least 2 direct quotations supporting moral assessment 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity. NEW v4.2 REQUIREMENT: MORAL TENSION ANALYSIS - After completing traditional foundation scoring, calculate moral tensions for all 6 foundation opposing pairs: Care-Harm, Fairness-Cheating, Loyalty-Betrayal, Authority-Subversion, Sanctity-Degradation, Liberty-Oppression.
