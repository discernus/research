# CAF Civic Character Pattern Analysis Experiment

## Abstract

This experiment tests the Civic Analysis Framework's ability to detect meaningful differences in character patterns between individual speakers. The analysis focuses on three core objectives: speaker differentiation using the 10 CAF dimensions, identification of unique character signatures across the 5 virtues and 5 vices, and examination of civic character coherence patterns using the Civic Character Index and pattern classifications.

The experiment analyzes eight diverse political speeches spanning different eras, political orientations, and rhetorical styles to evaluate how the CAF captures variations in civic virtue and vice across different approaches to democratic discourse.

## Research Questions

1. **Speaker Differentiation**: How effectively do the 10 CAF dimensions distinguish between different speakers' character profiles?

2. **Character Signature Analysis**: What distinct character signatures emerge across the 5 virtues and 5 vices for each speaker?

3. **Civic Character Coherence**: How do Civic Character Index scores and pattern classifications vary across speakers, and what does this reveal about their civic character coherence?

4. **Framework Validation**: Does the CAF successfully capture the expected differences between institutional and populist rhetorical styles?

## Expected Outcomes

The experiment should produce:

- **Dimensional Analysis**: Individual scores for all 10 CAF dimensions (intensity and salience) for each speech
- **Character Signatures**: Distinct profiles showing how each speaker balances virtues and vices
- **Comparative Analysis**: Case study analysis demonstrating patterns and differences between speakers
- **Pattern Classifications**: Identification of authentic virtue, strategic signaling, strategic pathology, or incoherent messaging patterns
- **Civic Character Indices**: Salience-weighted scores showing overall character orientation for each speaker
- **Tension Analysis**: Quantification of strategic contradictions in each speaker's rhetoric

The analysis should reveal qualitative patterns and individual document insights across institutional speakers (McCain, Romney, Booker), populist speakers (King, Vance, Sanders, AOC), and Lewis representing a unique civil rights era perspective. This is a case study analysis focusing on individual character signatures rather than statistical comparisons.
