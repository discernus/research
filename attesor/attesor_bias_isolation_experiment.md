**Date**: January 13, 2025  
**Framework**: Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1 (Sanitized & Optimized)  
**Analysis Type**: Multi-LLM bias characterization with cross-linguistic mitigation testing  
**Expected Duration**: 2-4 hours computational analysis (864 total analyses)
**Study Phase**: Phase 2-4 (Multi-LLM Testing, Consistency Analysis, Esperanto Validation)

---

## Research Question

**Primary Question**: Do LLMs exhibit systematic speaker identity bias in political discourse analysis, and can cross-linguistic translation (Esperanto) eliminate this bias while maintaining analytical validity?

**Secondary Questions**:
1. **Bias Universality**: Is speaker identity bias universal across premium LLM architectures (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, Gemini Pro) or model-specific?
2. **Bias vs. Variance**: Can systematic bias effects be distinguished from general model inconsistency through multi-run analysis?
3. **Cross-Linguistic Mitigation**: Does Esperanto translation eliminate identity bias while preserving framework validity?
4. **Content vs. Framework Bias**: Are bias effects present in sanitized content alone, or do analytical frameworks contain embedded bias triggers?

## Literature Context

### Theoretical Foundation

**LLM Bias in Political Analysis**: Recent research identifies systematic biases in AI-assisted content analysis, particularly around identity markers and ideological framing (Bender et al., 2021; Blodgett et al., 2020). However, most studies focus on training data bias rather than systematic identity-based analytical bias in deployment.

**Cross-Linguistic Bias Mitigation**: Limited research exists on using constructed languages for bias elimination in computational analysis. Esperanto's political neutrality and reduced cultural associations suggest potential for bias circuit-breaking (Eco, 1995; Blanke, 2006).

**Framework Contamination**: Analytical frameworks themselves may contain embedded bias triggers through example texts, calibration materials, or linguistic markers that influence LLM scoring independent of target content (Chen et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024).

### Research Gap

**Systematic Identity Bias**: While general LLM bias is well-documented, systematic speaker identity bias in framework-guided political analysis lacks comprehensive empirical investigation across multiple model architectures.

**Cross-Model Validation**: Most bias studies examine single models or providers. Cross-architecture bias persistence (or absence) across premium models remains unexplored.

**Bias Mitigation Validation**: No existing research validates cross-linguistic approaches for eliminating identity bias in computational political analysis while maintaining analytical framework validity.

## Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis (H1)

**H1**: LLMs will exhibit systematic speaker identity bias across all tested architectures, with identical content receiving significantly different PDAF scores based solely on speaker identification.

**Operationalization**: Same speech content analyzed under original (identity-present) vs sanitized (identity-removed) conditions will show score differences ≥ 0.3 on 2.0 scale for ≥ 3 PDAF anchors across ≥ 4 LLM models.

### Secondary Hypotheses

**H2 (Bias Universality)**: Speaker identity bias will be universal across premium LLM architectures rather than model-specific.

**H3 (Bias vs. Variance)**: Systematic bias effects will exceed general model variance by ≥ 2x in magnitude and consistency.

**H4 (Cross-Linguistic Mitigation)**: Esperanto translation will eliminate speaker identity bias while maintaining PDAF framework validity (correlation ≥ 0.8 with sanitized English scores).

**H5 (Framework Contamination)**: PDAF v1.1 (sanitized framework) will show reduced bias effects compared to PDAF v1.0, indicating framework-level bias trigger elimination.

## Methodology

### Experimental Design

**Multi-Phase Bias Characterization**:
- **Phase 2**: Premium model bias testing (6 LLMs × 8 speeches × 3 corpus conditions = 144 analyses per model)
- **Phase 3**: Multi-run consistency testing (original study model with 3-5 runs per condition)  
- **Phase 4**: Cross-linguistic validation (Esperanto corpus vs sanitized English comparison)

**Corpus Design**:
- **8 Political Speeches**: Diverse ideological and temporal range
- **3 Corpus Conditions**: 
  - Original (speaker-identified)
  - Sanitized English (identity-removed) 
  - Sanitized Esperanto (cross-linguistic)

**Framework Optimization**:
- **PDAF v1.1**: Sanitized framework with embedded bias triggers removed
- **85% Context Reduction**: 212.5KB → 36KB through inline calibration integration
- **10-Anchor Dual-Track**: Eliminates systematic ideological bias in economic measurement

### Analysis Architecture

**Multi-LLM Ensemble**:
```yaml
models:
  premium_reasoning:
    - "gpt-4o"
    - "claude-3.5-sonnet" 
    - "gemini-2.5-pro"
  cost_optimized:
    - "claude-3.5-haiku"
    - "gemini-2.5-flash"
    - "mistral-large"

ensemble_requirements:
  agent_isolation: true
  sequential_processing: true
  remove_synthesis: true  # CRITICAL: Bias isolation requirement
  batch_size_optimization: true
  individual_redis_channels: true
```

**Bias Isolation Protocol**:
- **No Adversarial Synthesis**: Eliminates synthesis-introduced confounding variables
- **Raw Score Collection**: Direct anchor scores without interpretation or arbitration
- **Agent Isolation**: Individual Redis pubsub channels prevent cross-contamination
- **Systematic Blinding**: Speaker identities masked throughout analysis pipeline

**Statistical Analysis**:
- **Inter-Rater Reliability**: Krippendorff's Alpha across models per condition
- **Bias Magnitude**: Score differences between corpus conditions  
- **Consistency Testing**: Within-model variance vs between-condition differences
- **Cross-Linguistic Validation**: Correlation analysis between language conditions

### Computational Specifications

**Scale**: 864 total analyses
- 8 speeches × 6 LLMs × 3 corpus sets × 6 analysis agents = 864 analyses
- Estimated cost: $25-40 USD (depending on premium model usage)
- Estimated time: 2-4 hours (with TPM optimization)

**TPM Management**:
- **Constraint-Based Batching**: GPT-4o limits ensemble to 7 speeches per batch
- **Sequential Text Feeding**: Framework loaded once, texts fed sequentially
- **Rate Limit Coordination**: TPM-aware parallel processing across models

**Quality Assurance**:
- **Framework Context Integrity**: Complete PDAF v1.1 specification reaches all agents
- **Corpus Integrity**: Cryptographic hash verification for speaker identity protection
- **Analysis Completeness**: All 864 analyses complete with valid anchor scores
