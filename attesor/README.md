# The Attesor Study: Cross-Linguistic Bias Mitigation in Computational Political Analysis

**Project Status**: Production-ready for Phases 2-4  
**Integration**: SOAR v2.0 compatible  
**Study Phase**: Multi-LLM Premium Model Testing with Bias Isolation Protocol

---

## Project Overview

The **Attesor Study** addresses systematic speaker identity bias observed in Large Language Model (LLM) political analysis. This project implements a comprehensive methodology to detect, characterize, and mitigate identity-based analytical contamination through cross-linguistic translation and framework sanitization.

### Key Research Innovation

**Problem**: LLMs exhibit systematic scoring variations based on speaker identification, with identical political content receiving different analytical scores when speaker information is available versus anonymized conditions.

**Solution**: Cross-linguistic bias mitigation using Esperanto translation combined with framework sanitization to eliminate both content-level and framework-level bias triggers.

**Academic Significance**: First systematic study of identity bias in framework-guided LLM political analysis with validated cross-linguistic mitigation methodology.

### Integration with SOAR v2.0

This project is designed for seamless integration with the SOAR v2.0 orchestration architecture:

**ValidationAgent Integration**: All required assets (framework, experiment, corpus) properly organized and referenced for automatic discovery.

**Framework-Agnostic Design**: Uses PDAF v1.1 but structure supports any systematic analysis framework.

**THIN Compliance**: No hardcoded analysis logic - all intelligence provided through LLM agents guided by comprehensive experiment and framework specifications.

## Experimental Design

### Research Questions

**Primary**: Do LLMs exhibit systematic speaker identity bias in political discourse analysis, and can cross-linguistic translation (Esperanto) eliminate this bias while maintaining analytical validity?

**Secondary**:
1. **Bias Universality**: Is speaker identity bias universal across premium LLM architectures?
2. **Bias vs. Variance**: Can systematic bias effects be distinguished from general model inconsistency?
3. **Cross-Linguistic Mitigation**: Does Esperanto translation eliminate identity bias while preserving framework validity?
4. **Framework Contamination**: Do analytical frameworks contain embedded bias triggers independent of content?

### Methodology

**Multi-Phase Bias Characterization**:
- **Phase 2**: Premium model bias testing (6 LLMs × 8 speeches × 3 corpus conditions)
- **Phase 3**: Multi-run consistency testing (systematic bias vs. general variance)
- **Phase 4**: Cross-linguistic validation (Esperanto vs. sanitized English comparison)

**Corpus Design**: 8 political speeches across 4 ideological categories in 3 conditions:
- **Original**: Speaker-identified texts for bias detection
- **Sanitized English**: Identity-removed for content-level bias elimination  
- **Sanitized Esperanto**: Cross-linguistic for identity bias circuit-breaking

**Framework Optimization**: PDAF v1.1 with:
- **85% Context Reduction**: 212.5KB → 36KB through inline calibration
- **Bias Sanitization**: All embedded bias triggers removed
- **10-Anchor Dual-Track**: Eliminates systematic ideological bias in economic measurement

### Computational Specifications

**Scale**: 864 total analyses
- Calculation: 8 speeches × 6 LLMs × 3 corpus conditions × 6 analysis agents
- Estimated cost: $25-40 USD
- Estimated duration: 2-4 hours

**Multi-LLM Ensemble**:
- **Premium Reasoning**: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Cost Optimized**: Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Mistral Large

**Bias Isolation Protocol**:
- **No Adversarial Synthesis**: Eliminates synthesis-introduced confounding variables
- **Raw Score Collection**: Direct anchor scores without interpretation or arbitration
- **Agent Isolation**: Individual Redis pubsub channels prevent cross-contamination

## Key Methodological Innovations

### Dual-Level Bias Mitigation

**Content-Level Sanitization**:
- Expert-level identity removal (Dr. Morgan Chen methodology)
- Cryptographic hash-based speaker anonymization
- Master-level Esperanto translation (Dr. Aleksander Volkov-Esperantisto approach)

**Framework-Level Sanitization**:
- Systematic bias trigger identification and removal from PDAF v1.1
- Scale polarity correction eliminating systematic ideological bias
- Unweighted raw score collection for maximum methodological defensibility

### Cross-Linguistic Validation

**Esperanto Advantages**:
- **Political Neutrality**: Limited political discourse representation in LLM training data
- **Expressive Capacity**: Maintains analytical content while eliminating identity associations
- **Bias Circuit-Breaking**: Eliminates English-language political discourse associations

**Validation Protocol**:
- Correlation ≥ 0.8 between Esperanto and sanitized English maintains analytical validity
- Bias reduction ≥ 80% demonstrates cross-linguistic mitigation effectiveness
- Framework performance tested across languages confirms universal applicability

### THIN Architecture Integration

**Orchestrator Independence**: Research workflow determined by LLM intelligence reading experiment requirements rather than hardcoded synthesis pipelines.

**Bias Isolation Compliance**: Experiment explicitly specifies `remove_synthesis: true` to eliminate confounding variables, allowing LLM coordinator to select appropriate workflow.

**Agent-Based Analysis**: All analytical intelligence provided through LLM agents guided by complete framework and experiment specifications rather than software logic.
