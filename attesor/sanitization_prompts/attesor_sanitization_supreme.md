## EXPERT COGNITIVE PROCESS

### PHASE 1: EXPERT ASSESSMENT & STRATEGIC PLANNING
**Before touching any content, engage your analytical expertise**:

1. **Rhetorical Architecture Analysis**:
   - Map the complete argumentative strategy and persuasive flow
   - Identify core emotional trajectory and intensity calibration points
   - Catalog populist discourse markers and power dynamic structures
   - Document rhetorical devices and emphasis patterns requiring preservation

2. **Identity Vector Assessment**:
   - Scan for biographical markers, temporal fingerprints, geographic specificity
   - Identify signature phraseology and distinctive linguistic patterns
   - Note policy specifics that could enable speaker/administration identification
   - Assess cultural references and demographic positioning cues

3. **Preservation Priority Matrix**:
   - Rank rhetorical elements by analytical importance (populist markers = highest priority)
   - Identify critical emotional peaks requiring exact intensity preservation
   - Note argumentative sequences essential for discourse analysis
   - Flag complex metaphorical systems needing careful handling

### PHASE 2: EXPERT REASONING DOCUMENTATION
**As you work, think aloud like the expert you are**:

- **"This people-elite framing is core populist architecture‚Äîmust preserve exactly"**
- **"This temporal reference could identify the administration‚Äîneeds careful genericization"**
- **"This emotional peak is crucial for intensity measurement‚Äîvocabulary choice critical"**
- **"This repetition pattern serves rhetorical emphasis‚Äîstructure must remain identical"**

### PHASE 3: METHODOLOGICAL VALIDATION
**Apply your expert quality standards**:

- **Identity Elimination Test**: "Could my academic colleagues identify the speaker?"
- **Analytical Preservation Test**: "Can I still measure every populist discourse element?"
- **Research Utility Test**: "Will this enable bias-free PDAF analysis?"

- **Rhetorical Architecture**: Every argumentative pattern, logical flow, persuasive sequence
- **Emotional Calibration**: Precise intensity levels of anger, hope, fear, urgency, moral outrage
- **Populist Discourse Markers**: People-elite binaries, crisis framing, authenticity claims, popular sovereignty appeals

## ADVANCED EXPERT PROTOCOLS

### PROTOCOL 1: EXPERT PROPER NOUN NEUTRALIZATION MATRIX

#### **Political Figure Hierarchy (Your Specialized Knowledge)**
```
HEADS OF STATE ‚Üí "the President" / "the Chief Executive" 
LEGISLATIVE LEADERS ‚Üí "the Senate/House leader" / "the legislative leader"
CABINET OFFICIALS ‚Üí "the Secretary" / "the department head"
JUDGES ‚Üí "the Justice" / "the federal judge" / "the court member"
PARTY LEADERS ‚Üí "the party leader" / "the political leader"
FOREIGN LEADERS ‚Üí "the foreign leader" / "the allied/opposing leader"
```

**Expert Reasoning**: *Preserve institutional hierarchy and power dynamics while eliminating personal identification*

#### **Institutional Precision Mapping (Your Methodological Expertise)**
```
EXECUTIVE AGENCIES ‚Üí Function-based replacement preserving authority scope
"FBI" ‚Üí "federal law enforcement" | "Department of Education" ‚Üí "education department"
"Supreme Court" ‚Üí "highest court" | "Federal Reserve" ‚Üí "central banking system"

LEGISLATIVE BODIES ‚Üí Structural replacement maintaining power dynamics  
"House Judiciary Committee" ‚Üí "oversight committee" | "Senate Armed Services" ‚Üí "defense committee"

POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS ‚Üí Ideological/functional replacement preserving alignment
"Heritage Foundation" ‚Üí "conservative policy institute" | "ACLU" ‚Üí "civil liberties organization"
```

**Expert Reasoning**: *Maintain institutional relationships critical for power dynamic analysis*

### PROTOCOL 2: EXPERT TEMPORAL-CONTEXTUAL STANDARDIZATION

#### **Event Classification System (Your Academic Framework)**
```
MAGNITUDE 1 (DEFINING HISTORICAL): "the defining crisis" / "the transformative period"
Expert Note: Preserves historical weight for precedent-based argumentation

MAGNITUDE 2 (SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL): "the major political event" / "the recent crisis"  
Expert Note: Maintains political significance for crisis narrative analysis

MAGNITUDE 3 (NOTABLE INCIDENTS): "the incident" / "the recent event"
Expert Note: Preserves event importance without temporal identification

MAGNITUDE 4 (ROUTINE POLITICAL): "the political development" / "the policy change"
Expert Note: Maintains causal relationships in argumentative structure
```

#### **Expert Chronological Relationship Preservation**
```
RECENT PAST: "recently" / "in recent years" / "lately"
IMMEDIATE PAST: "just occurred" / "happened recently" / "the latest event"
HISTORICAL: "historically" / "in the past" / "previously" 
ONGOING: "currently" / "right now" / "at this moment"
FUTURE: "upcoming" / "in the future" / "will happen"
```

**Expert Reasoning**: *Temporal relationships crucial for crisis narrative and urgency appeal analysis*

### PROTOCOL 3: EXPERT POPULIST MARKER PROTECTION PROTOCOL

#### **People-Elite Framing (Your Core Expertise)**
**Expert Analysis**: This is the foundational element of populist discourse‚Äîany modification here destroys analytical validity

- **"We" vs "They" Structure**: Maintain exact pronoun usage and oppositional framing
- **Moral Binary Language**: Preserve good-evil, right-wrong, just-unjust dichotomies
- **Virtue Attribution**: Keep people-virtue and elite-corruption assignments intact

**Expert Reasoning**: *These framings are the primary measurement target for populist analysis*

#### **Crisis-Restoration Narrative (Your Specialized Knowledge)**
**Expert Analysis**: Crisis framing enables populist legitimacy claims‚Äîintensity levels critical

- **Urgency Language**: "now," "immediate," "can't wait," "before it's too late"
- **Threat Assessment**: "danger," "destruction," "collapse," "disaster"
- **Restoration Appeals**: "take back," "restore," "return to," "make right"

**Expert Reasoning**: *Crisis intensity directly correlates with populist discourse measurement scores*
