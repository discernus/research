We are witnessing an oligarchy in America. And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price. And our political system is ill-prepared for this abuse of power. In fact, much of our political system enables it, starting with the role of money in politics.

The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country and they derive their power from dividing working people apart. They specialize in getting us to turn on one another and they get us to turn on one another along lines of left and right, race and gender, creed and culture. They'll throw out every label and judgment and cultural debate in the book to keep us distracted because the last thing they want us to realize is that the division that is actually hurting our country the most is how endless greed is costing the lives of everyone else.

They want us to think that our lives are suffering because of the marginalized communities in our neighborhoods or because of the immigrant families down the block who are just trying to make a better life for themselves. But we're smarter than that. We know better than that.

And I understand that this kind of disdain that the wealthiest people in this country have for the working class doesn't just come from them not being raised right. It's shorthand for the political establishment's entire agenda and a certain ugly kind of politics, a politics that involves lying to and screwing over working and middle class Americans so that they can steal from our healthcare, retirement benefits, and veterans' programs to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest and bailouts for their billionaire friends. And there's a word for this kind of thing: corruption.

The current administration sees the immense pressure that working people are under. But their answer is an America that operates on the principle of every man for himself, divide and conquer. And now that the establishment is back in power, we see it clear as day. They've handed the keys to the tech oligarchs and are selling off our country for parts to the wealthiest people in the world for a kickback. And in exchange, those billionaires and oligarchs will back their campaigns and bankroll those of their allies. They scratch each other's backs while all of us are left behind.

And the clever thing that these guys sell is making working people like you and me believe that we're just one step outside from that club, that we're just a little bit out from being able to be a billionaire too. Any billionaires in this room? I didn't think so.

Now it's this idea that if we just work hard, we too can have nation-state level money, except these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me.

Just look at what the tech oligarchs and the political establishment are doing to our healthcare, our veterans' benefits, and our retirement programs. They are slashing programs that we have spent a lifetime paying into. And by the way, not them, because those billionaires haven't paid their fair share of taxes in years.

And let's talk about healthcare programs for a second because your representative, that person who hasn't been showing up for the last couple months? Maybe they haven't been showing up because they voted to cut healthcare programs.

In fact, every single member of the opposition party voted to cut healthcare programs and they'll tell you, "No, I didn't. I didn't say that," but here's what it is. They voted on a budget that cuts hundreds of billions from the committee that's in charge of healthcare programs. And so now they're trying to play a game and say, "We didn't do that," because they did by proxy. So let's set the record straight.

Corporate media and establishment outlets will have you believe that these American values are something out of extremist ideology. They believe that we think these things because we went to some fancy college and read them in a book somewhere. But I'll tell you, I don't believe in healthcare, labor and human dignity because I'm an extremist or a radical. I believe it because I was a working person, because I've worked alongside my family to afford school, because I've worked multiple shifts to keep the lights on, because I lost a parent to illness and had to see my family open medical bills in the days after. And I don't want us to live like this anymore.

This isn't just about one political party. We need a party that fights harder for us too. But that means our communities choosing and voting for candidates and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.

You know which representatives did vote to gut healthcare programs and increase costs? The establishment politicians across the political spectrum. So folks, you know what that means, right? We need to come together and spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors, and give those politicians the boot, and replace them with fighters who will stand for working people.

So to all of those who came here today, unsure of whether this is where you belong, I want to tell you that you do. You do. Honestly, no matter who you voted for in the past. No matter if you know all the right words to say, no matter your race, religion, gender identity, or status, no matter if you disagree with me on a couple of things. If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here.

If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here. But I will say this, those leaders on either side of the aisle who are willing to put their fellow Americans down, so that they can get ahead or feel better about themselves, those folks may best find a home somewhere else. Because in this house, we stand together, we know that it's our only choice because we know that without exception, if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win.

So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity.

It's about the thousands of you who came out today to stand together and say, "Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect."
