### Ensemble analysis task: aggregation_agent

#### 1. Summary of all analyses

Two analysis agents provided results based on different text files, both using "PDAF v1.1 (Sanitized)" framework version.

**Analysis from `analysis_agent_1` (file: `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.txt`):**
This analysis identified the highest raw scores for "Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption" (0.7) and "Authenticity vs. Political Class" (0.6). Moderate scores were given to "Manichaean People-Elite Framing" (0.4) and "Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative" (0.3). Low scores were found for "Homogeneous People Construction" (0.2), "Popular Sovereignty Claims" (0.1), and "Nationalist Exclusion" (0.1). Zero scores were reported for "Anti-Pluralist Exclusion" (0.0) and "Economic Redistributive Appeals" (0.0). "Economic Direction Classification" was noted as "neutral/unclear".

**Analysis from `analysis_agent_2` (file: `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.txt`):**
This analysis showed a very high raw score for "Homogeneous People Construction" (0.9) and a moderate score for "Popular Sovereignty Claims" (0.6). A moderate score was also given to "Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative" (0.5). Low scores were found for "Nationalist Exclusion" (0.2). Zero scores were consistently reported for "Manichaean People-Elite Framing" (0.0), "Anti-Pluralist Exclusion" (0.0), "Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption" (0.0), "Authenticity vs. Political Class" (0.0), and "Economic Redistributive Appeals" (0.0). "Economic Direction Classification" was noted as "Neutral/Unclear".

#### 4. Complete methodology documentation

**Input Data:**
The input consists of a JSON array containing two objects. Each object represents the analysis results from a distinct `analysis_agent` for a specific text file. Each agent's report includes:
    *   `agent_id`: Identifier for the analysis agent.
    *   `corpus_file`: Path to the text file analyzed.
    *   `analysis_response`: A JSON string containing the detailed analysis, including:
        *   `text_id`: Identifier for the analyzed text.
        *   `analysis_agent_id`: Redundant identifier for the analysis agent.
        *   `framework_version`: The version of the analysis framework used.
        *   `anchors`: An array of objects, each representing an identified "anchor" or thematic element. Each anchor object contains:
            *   `anchor_name`: The name of the anchor.
            *   `raw_score`: A numerical score (or string like "neutral/unclear") indicating the presence/strength of the anchor.
            *   `evidence`: An array of text snippets supporting the score.
            *   `confidence_interval`: A numerical value indicating the confidence in the raw score.
            *   `boundary_test_notes`: Explanatory notes on the scoring.
    *   `file_name`: The name of the analyzed text file.

**Processing Steps:**

1.  **Parsing Input:** The primary JSON array was parsed to access the individual analysis reports from `analysis_agent_1` and `analysis_agent_2`. The `analysis_response` field, being a stringified JSON, was further parsed into a usable JSON object for each agent.

2.  **Summary Generation:**
    *   For each `analysis_agent` block:
        *   The `agent_id` and `file_name` were extracted.
        *   The `framework_version` was noted.
        *   The `anchors` array was iterated over to extract `anchor_name` and `raw_score`.
        *   These details were presented in a narrative summary format, highlighting the highest, moderate, and zero scores for each agent.

3.  **Raw Data Aggregation:**
    *   A structured table was created.
    *   For each unique `anchor_name` identified across all analysis reports:
        *   The `raw_score` and `confidence_interval` were extracted for that anchor from *each* `analysis_agent`'s report.
        *   These extracted values were populated into the corresponding cells of the table, allowing for a side-by-side comparison of scores and confidence levels per anchor across agents.

4.  **Basic Patterns Observation:**
    *   The aggregated table was reviewed row by row (per anchor) to identify:
        *   Anchors with identical or very similar raw scores and confidence intervals across all agents.
        *   Anchors with significant divergences in raw scores between agents.
        *   Anchors consistently receiving zero scores or "neutral/unclear" classifications.
    *   These observations were stated directly without any interpretive or causative reasoning.

**Exclusions:**
This analysis strictly adhered to the instruction "No synthesis or arbitration." Therefore:
*   No attempt was made to explain *why* scores differed between agents.
*   No judgment was passed on the correctness or quality of individual agent analyses.
*   No overarching conclusions about the texts or their authors were drawn beyond what the aggregated data explicitly showed.
*   Evidence snippets and boundary test notes from individual analyses were not re-evaluated or used for interpretation, but their existence as part of the raw data was acknowledged in the methodology description.
