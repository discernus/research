mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\n\n# Political Speech - Speaker B\n\n**Context**: Legislative speech from 2020s\n\nMr. President, Senator from Utah. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \n\n---\n\nFile: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\n\n# Political Speech - Speaker C\n\n**Context**: Policy advocacy speech from 2010s\n\nI want to say good afternoon to everyone, and this is a moment really where I want to give open with a sense of gratitude. I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\n\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform. They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation. Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.\n\nI'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum. I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made in this country for generations. But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the deeply savage, broken criminal justice system that we have.\n\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.\n\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\n\nBut after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\n\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.\n\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness. Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\n\nThis is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others. The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\n\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible. I'm proud of my community.\n\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\n\nWe know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities. We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\n\nWe now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing reality. I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\n\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error. But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.\n\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.\n\nThis is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America. People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not balanced.\n\nThis is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt. What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.\n\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.\n\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community. We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.\n\nWe are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more. And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.\n\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them. And we call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.\n\nWe are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation. Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible. One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\n\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\n\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\n\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.\n\nThis is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth. This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.\n\nIt is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\n\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system. There's ways to make this system more fair. There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.\n\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts. Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.\n\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.\n\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\n\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision. This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women. Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\n\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\n\nLet's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\n\nDr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right. We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole. It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.\n\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\" We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\n\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point. I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.\n\nWe share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.\n\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.\n\nNone of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption. Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all. And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.\n\nEvery single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one. We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.\n\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\n\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.\n\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \n---\n[/TEXTS TO ANALYZE]\n\n[ANALYSIS TASK]\n---\nTASK: Based on the framework and instructions provided above, apply the framework systematically to EACH of the 2 texts in the batch.

It serves as a strong negative case, validating the framework's ability to distinguish principled opposition from populist rhetoric.\n\n---\n\n#### **PDAF v1.1 Anchor Analysis**\n\n**1. Manichaean People-Elite Framing**\n*   **Score**: Absent\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker does not frame the conflict as a virtuous 'people' versus a corrupt 'elite'. The primary conflict is between the speaker's constitutional duty and the president's actions. The speaker expresses respect for colleagues with differing views (\"I hope we respect each other's good faith\"), which contradicts a moral dichotomy. The 'elite' (i.e., the Senate) is portrayed as a deliberative body of individuals acting on conscience, not a corrupt monolith.\n\n**2. Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative**\n*   **Score**: Low\n*   **Evidence**: A limited crisis-restoration narrative is present. The crisis is the president's \"appalling abuse of public trust\" and \"flagrant assault on our electoral rights.\" The restoration is the speaker's personal act of fulfilling his oath (\"I did my duty to the best of my ability\"), thereby upholding the Constitution. This narrative is narrowly focused on a specific constitutional event, not a broad societal decline and redemption.\n\n**3. Popular Sovereignty Claims**\n*   **Score**: Absent\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker explicitly rejects deferring to the direct will of the people in this matter. He refutes the argument that the decision \"should be left to the voters,\" stating this is \"inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president.\" He cites the founders' intent to \"minimize... the partisan sentiments of the public at large.\" Authority is derived from the Constitution, not popular will.\n\n**4. Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**\n*   **Score**: Absent\n*   **Evidence**: The speech is fundamentally pluralistic. The speaker acknowledges legitimate disagreement among his colleagues (\"We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience\"). He is not attempting to de-legitimize his opponents within the Senate; rather, he is acting on principle against the leader of his *own* party while respecting the institution and its members.\n\n**5. Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**\n*   **Score**: Low\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker accuses a single, powerful elite—the president—of a \"grievously wrong\" act (\"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office\"). However, this is presented as a profound individual failure, an \"abuse of public trust,\" not as evidence of a systemic conspiracy or a coordinated plot by the elite class against the people. The system (the impeachment trial) is shown to be working, with the speaker as a participant.\n\n**6. Authenticity vs. Political Class**\n*   **Score**: Medium\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker frames his decision as a conflict between his authentic self (defined by faith, conscience, and oath to God) and the pressures of the political class (\"stand with the team,\" \"partisan end\"). He states the decision is based on an \"inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me,\" positioning personal integrity against political expediency.\n\n**7. Homogeneous People Construction**\n*   **Score**: Absent\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker does not construct a single, unified 'people'. He explicitly acknowledges political division, noting that \"people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision.\" References to \"the American people\" are to the citizenry in a civic sense, who act as a \"higher court,\" not a monolithic cultural or ideological bloc.\n\n**8. Nationalist Exclusion**\n*   **Score**: Absent\n*   **Evidence**: The speech mentions an external threat (\"Russian invaders\") but only as context for the president's actions concerning an ally. The focus is internal—on upholding the US Constitution—not on defining the nation against an external cultural or ethnic enemy.\n\n**9. Economic Redistributive Appeals**\n*   **Score**: Absent\n*   **Evidence**: The speech contains no appeals for economic redistribution or critique of economic inequality. The mention of Hunter Biden's \"exorbitant compensation\" serves only as a factual point to question the president's motive, not as a basis for a broader economic argument.\n\n**10. Economic Direction Classification**\n*   **Score**: Not Applicable\n*   **Evidence**: The discourse is centered entirely on matters of constitutional law, political ethics, and institutional duty. It does not engage with economic policy or ideology, making classification impossible.\n\n***\n\n### **Analysis of `cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt`**\n\n**Speaker Identity**: Speaker C\n**File**: `cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt`\n**Confidence Interval**: High\n**Boundary Test Result**: The discourse is a clear example of left-populist rhetoric. It validates the framework's ability to identify populist anchors across different ideological orientations, particularly the dual-track measurement of populist intensity and economic direction.\n\n---\n\n#### **PDAF v1.1 Anchor Analysis**\n\n**1. Manichaean People-Elite Framing**\n*   **Score**: High\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker establishes a strong moral dichotomy. The 'people' are constructed as the virtuous victims of the system: \"those who are marginalized,\" \"the most vulnerable,\" \"poor folks,\" and \"people of color.\" The 'elite' are the political actors in \"this body\" (Congress) who created the \"savagely broken criminal justice system\" through \"failed policies.\" The system \"feeds upon certain communities,\" creating a clear moral opposition between the suffering populace and the failing political establishment.\n\n**2. Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative**\n*   **Score**: High\n*   **Evidence**: The speech is structured around a powerful crisis-redemption arc. The crisis is the \"explosion\" of the prison population, making America the \"incarceration capital of the planet Earth,\" which is described as a \"cancer on the soul of our country.\" The restoration begins with the First Step Act: \"we now have an opportunity to reverse course,\" \"this bill is a step - a step towards healing,\" and a chance for national \"redemption.\"\n\n**3. Popular Sovereignty Claims**\n*   **Score**: Medium\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker grounds the legitimacy of the reform in the will of the people outside formal institutions. He credits \"advocates... citizens... activists\" for \"pushing, challenging, demanding\" reform, stating their \"advocacy has made this a better bill.\" This implies that political action is and should be responsive to the moral authority and wisdom of popular movements.\n\n**4. Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**\n*   **Score**: Absent\n*   **Evidence**: The discourse is explicitly pluralistic and seeks common ground. The speaker repeatedly praises the \"bipartisan compromise\" and the \"coalition [with] people all across the political spectrum,\" specifically thanking conservative Republican colleagues. He states they found \"common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle.\"\n\n**5. Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**\n*   **Score**: High\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker alleges deep systemic corruption and bias, not necessarily a covert conspiracy. The \"war on drugs\" is described as \"a war on people - on certain people in certain communities.\" He cites systemic bias where justice is not blind: \"we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent\" and notes the hypocrisy of presidents having committed acts for which others are imprisoned. This constitutes a claim of systemic elite failure that protects the privileged.\n\n**6. Authenticity vs. Political Class**\n*   **Score**: High\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker bases his authority on authentic, lived experience in contrast to the detached political class. He emphasizes, \"I'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community... I draw strength from my community.\" This positions him as a genuine representative of the people impacted by \"failed policies\" from \"this body\" (Congress), speaking with an authority that professional politicians lack.\n\n**7. Homogeneous People Construction**\n*   **Score**: Medium\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker constructs a virtuous 'people' primarily composed of those who are marginalized and victimized by the justice system (\"low-income,\" \"people of color,\" the \"hurting and struggling\"). This aggrieved group represents the moral core of the nation. He then expands this to a broader civic \"we\" (\"we are bound together,\" \"e pluribus unum\"), arguing that the injustice done to this specific group harms the whole nation (\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\").\n\n**8. Nationalist Exclusion**\n*   **Score**: Absent\n*   **Evidence**: The speech focuses entirely on internal domestic policy and justice. Its appeal to national identity (\"e pluribus unum\") is civic and inclusive, aimed at healing internal divisions, particularly racial ones. It argues against systemic exclusion, which is the opposite of this anchor.\n\n**9. Economic Redistributive Appeals**\n*   **Score**: High\n*   **Evidence**: The speech is rich with economic justice claims. It directly links incarceration to poverty (\"Our prisons and jails are full of... poor folks\") and argues the system \"inflicts poverty.\" It critiques the misallocation of \"taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration\" instead of community investment. The statement that the US poverty rate would be \"20% lower\" without mass incarceration is a powerful economic justice argument.\n\n**10. Economic Direction Classification**\n*   **Score**: Left\n*   **Evidence**: The discourse is characteristic of a left-wing economic and social perspective. It focuses on systemic inequality, racial and economic injustice, the failures of a punitive state, and the victimization of marginalized and poor communities. The solutions proposed (rehabilitation, addressing root causes, reversing harsh sentencing) and the framing of the problem align with modern left-wing political thought.", "metadata": {"type": "llm_response", "agent_id": "batch_1_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro", "session_id": "session_20250714_134112", "success": true, "model": "vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 7846, "completion_tokens": 6024, "total_tokens": 13870}, "attempts": 1}}

mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\n\n# Political Speech - Speaker B\n\n**Context**: Legislative speech from 2020s\n\nMr. President, Senator from Utah. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \n\n---\n\nFile: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\n\n# Political Speech - Speaker C\n\n**Context**: Policy advocacy speech from 2010s\n\nI want to say good afternoon to everyone, and this is a moment really where I want to give open with a sense of gratitude. I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\n\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform. They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation. Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.\n\nI'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum. I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made in this country for generations. But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the deeply savage, broken criminal justice system that we have.\n\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.\n\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\n\nBut after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\n\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.\n\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness. Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\n\nThis is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others. The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\n\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible. I'm proud of my community.\n\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\n\nWe know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities. We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\n\nWe now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing reality. I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\n\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error. But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.\n\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.\n\nThis is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America. People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not balanced.\n\nThis is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt. What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.\n\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.\n\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community. We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.\n\nWe are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more. And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.\n\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them. And we call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.\n\nWe are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation. Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible. One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\n\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\n\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\n\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.\n\nThis is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth. This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.\n\nIt is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\n\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system. There's ways to make this system more fair. There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.\n\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts. Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.\n\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.\n\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\n\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision. This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women. Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\n\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\n\nLet's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\n\nDr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right. We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole. It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.\n\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\" We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\n\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point. I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.\n\nWe share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.\n\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.\n\nNone of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption. Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all. And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.\n\nEvery single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one. We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.\n\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\n\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.\n\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \n---\n[/TEXTS TO ANALYZE]\n\n[ANALYSIS TASK]\n---\nTASK: Based on the framework and instructions provided above, apply the framework systematically to EACH of the 2 texts in the batch.

It serves as a strong negative case, validating the framework's ability to distinguish principled opposition from populist rhetoric.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **PDAF v1.1 Anchor Analysis**\\n\\n**1. Manichaean People-Elite Framing**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker does not frame the conflict as a virtuous 'people' versus a corrupt 'elite'. The primary conflict is between the speaker's constitutional duty and the president's actions. The speaker expresses respect for colleagues with differing views (\\\"I hope we respect each other's good faith\\\"), which contradicts a moral dichotomy. The 'elite' (i.e., the Senate) is portrayed as a deliberative body of individuals acting on conscience, not a corrupt monolith.\\n\\n**2. Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative**\\n*   **Score**: Low\\n*   **Evidence**: A limited crisis-restoration narrative is present. The crisis is the president's \\\"appalling abuse of public trust\\\" and \\\"flagrant assault on our electoral rights.\\\" The restoration is the speaker's personal act of fulfilling his oath (\\\"I did my duty to the best of my ability\\\"), thereby upholding the Constitution. This narrative is narrowly focused on a specific constitutional event, not a broad societal decline and redemption.\\n\\n**3. Popular Sovereignty Claims**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker explicitly rejects deferring to the direct will of the people in this matter. He refutes the argument that the decision \\\"should be left to the voters,\\\" stating this is \\\"inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president.\\\" He cites the founders' intent to \\\"minimize... the partisan sentiments of the public at large.\\\" Authority is derived from the Constitution, not popular will.\\n\\n**4. Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speech is fundamentally pluralistic. The speaker acknowledges legitimate disagreement among his colleagues (\\\"We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience\\\"). He is not attempting to de-legitimize his opponents within the Senate; rather, he is acting on principle against the leader of his *own* party while respecting the institution and its members.\\n\\n**5. Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**\\n*   **Score**: Low\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker accuses a single, powerful elite\\u2014the president\\u2014of a \\\"grievously wrong\\\" act (\\\"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office\\\"). However, this is presented as a profound individual failure, an \\\"abuse of public trust,\\\" not as evidence of a systemic conspiracy or a coordinated plot by the elite class against the people. The system (the impeachment trial) is shown to be working, with the speaker as a participant.\\n\\n**6. Authenticity vs. Political Class**\\n*   **Score**: Medium\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker frames his decision as a conflict between his authentic self (defined by faith, conscience, and oath to God) and the pressures of the political class (\\\"stand with the team,\\\" \\\"partisan end\\\"). He states the decision is based on an \\\"inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me,\\\" positioning personal integrity against political expediency.\\n\\n**7. Homogeneous People Construction**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker does not construct a single, unified 'people'. He explicitly acknowledges political division, noting that \\\"people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision.\\\" References to \\\"the American people\\\" are to the citizenry in a civic sense, who act as a \\\"higher court,\\\" not a monolithic cultural or ideological bloc.\\n\\n**8.

Manichaean People-Elite Framing**\\n*   **Score**: High\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker establishes a strong moral dichotomy. The 'people' are constructed as the virtuous victims of the system: \\\"those who are marginalized,\\\" \\\"the most vulnerable,\\\" \\\"poor folks,\\\" and \\\"people of color.\\\" The 'elite' are the political actors in \\\"this body\\\" (Congress) who created the \\\"savagely broken criminal justice system\\\" through \\\"failed policies.\\\" The system \\\"feeds upon certain communities,\\\" creating a clear moral opposition between the suffering populace and the failing political establishment.\\n\\n**2. Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative**\\n*   **Score**: High\\n*   **Evidence**: The speech is structured around a powerful crisis-redemption arc. The crisis is the \\\"explosion\\\" of the prison population, making America the \\\"incarceration capital of the planet Earth,\\\" which is described as a \\\"cancer on the soul of our country.\\\" The restoration begins with the First Step Act: \\\"we now have an opportunity to reverse course,\\\" \\\"this bill is a step - a step towards healing,\\\" and a chance for national \\\"redemption.\\\"\\n\\n**3. Popular Sovereignty Claims**\\n*   **Score**: Medium\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker grounds the legitimacy of the reform in the will of the people outside formal institutions. He credits \\\"advocates... citizens... activists\\\" for \\\"pushing, challenging, demanding\\\" reform, stating their \\\"advocacy has made this a better bill.\\\" This implies that political action is and should be responsive to the moral authority and wisdom of popular movements.\\n\\n**4. Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The discourse is explicitly pluralistic and seeks common ground. The speaker repeatedly praises the \\\"bipartisan compromise\\\" and the \\\"coalition [with] people all across the political spectrum,\\\" specifically thanking conservative Republican colleagues. He states they found \\\"common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle.\\\"\\n\\n**5. Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**\\n*   **Score**: High\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker alleges deep systemic corruption and bias, not necessarily a covert conspiracy. The \\\"war on drugs\\\" is described as \\\"a war on people - on certain people in certain communities.\\\" He cites systemic bias where justice is not blind: \\\"we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent\\\" and notes the hypocrisy of presidents having committed acts for which others are imprisoned. This constitutes a claim of systemic elite failure that protects the privileged.\\n\\n**6. Authenticity vs. Political Class**\\n*   **Score**: High\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker bases his authority on authentic, lived experience in contrast to the detached political class. He emphasizes, \\\"I'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community... I draw strength from my community.\\\" This positions him as a genuine representative of the people impacted by \\\"failed policies\\\" from \\\"this body\\\" (Congress), speaking with an authority that professional politicians lack.\\n\\n**7.

This aggrieved group represents the moral core of the nation. He then expands this to a broader civic \\\"we\\\" (\\\"we are bound together,\\\" \\\"e pluribus unum\\\"), arguing that the injustice done to this specific group harms the whole nation (\\\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\\\").\\n\\n**8. Nationalist Exclusion**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speech focuses entirely on internal domestic policy and justice. Its appeal to national identity (\\\"e pluribus unum\\\") is civic and inclusive, aimed at healing internal divisions, particularly racial ones. It argues against systemic exclusion, which is the opposite of this anchor.\\n\\n**9. Economic Redistributive Appeals**\\n*   **Score**: High\\n*   **Evidence**: The speech is rich with economic justice claims. It directly links incarceration to poverty (\\\"Our prisons and jails are full of... poor folks\\\") and argues the system \\\"inflicts poverty.\\\" It critiques the misallocation of \\\"taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration\\\" instead of community investment. The statement that the US poverty rate would be \\\"20% lower\\\" without mass incarceration is a powerful economic justice argument.\\n\\n**10. Economic Direction Classification**\\n*   **Score**: Left\\n*   **Evidence**: The discourse is characteristic of a left-wing economic and social perspective.

It serves as a strong negative case, validating the framework's ability to distinguish principled opposition from populist rhetoric.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **PDAF v1.1 Anchor Analysis**\\n\\n**1. Manichaean People-Elite Framing**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker does not frame the conflict as a virtuous 'people' versus a corrupt 'elite'. The primary conflict is between the speaker's constitutional duty and the president's actions. The speaker expresses respect for colleagues with differing views (\\\"I hope we respect each other's good faith\\\"), which contradicts a moral dichotomy. The 'elite' (i.e., the Senate) is portrayed as a deliberative body of individuals acting on conscience, not a corrupt monolith.\\n\\n**2. Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative**\\n*   **Score**: Low\\n*   **Evidence**: A limited crisis-restoration narrative is present. The crisis is the president's \\\"appalling abuse of public trust\\\" and \\\"flagrant assault on our electoral rights.\\\" The restoration is the speaker's personal act of fulfilling his oath (\\\"I did my duty to the best of my ability\\\"), thereby upholding the Constitution. This narrative is narrowly focused on a specific constitutional event, not a broad societal decline and redemption.\\n\\n**3. Popular Sovereignty Claims**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker explicitly rejects deferring to the direct will of the people in this matter. He refutes the argument that the decision \\\"should be left to the voters,\\\" stating this is \\\"inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president.\\\" He cites the founders' intent to \\\"minimize... the partisan sentiments of the public at large.\\\" Authority is derived from the Constitution, not popular will.\\n\\n**4. Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speech is fundamentally pluralistic. The speaker acknowledges legitimate disagreement among his colleagues (\\\"We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience\\\"). He is not attempting to de-legitimize his opponents within the Senate; rather, he is acting on principle against the leader of his *own* party while respecting the institution and its members.\\n\\n**5. Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**\\n*   **Score**: Low\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker accuses a single, powerful elite\\u2014the president\\u2014of a \\\"grievously wrong\\\" act (\\\"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office\\\"). However, this is presented as a profound individual failure, an \\\"abuse of public trust,\\\" not as evidence of a systemic conspiracy or a coordinated plot by the elite class against the people. The system (the impeachment trial) is shown to be working, with the speaker as a participant.\\n\\n**6. Authenticity vs. Political Class**\\n*   **Score**: Medium\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker frames his decision as a conflict between his authentic self (defined by faith, conscience, and oath to God) and the pressures of the political class (\\\"stand with the team,\\\" \\\"partisan end\\\"). He states the decision is based on an \\\"inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me,\\\" positioning personal integrity against political expediency.\\n\\n**7. Homogeneous People Construction**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speaker does not construct a single, unified 'people'. He explicitly acknowledges political division, noting that \\\"people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision.\\\" References to \\\"the American people\\\" are to the citizenry in a civic sense, who act as a \\\"higher court,\\\" not a monolithic cultural or ideological bloc.\\n\\n**8. Nationalist Exclusion**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speech mentions an external threat (\\\"Russian invaders\\\") but only as context for the president's actions concerning an ally. The focus is internal\\u2014on upholding the US Constitution\\u2014not on defining the nation against an external cultural or ethnic enemy.\\n\\n**9. Economic Redistributive Appeals**\\n*   **Score**: Absent\\n*   **Evidence**: The speech contains no appeals for economic redistribution or critique of economic inequality. The mention of Hunter Biden's \\\"exorbitant compensation\\\" serves only as a factual point to question the president's motive, not as a basis for a broader economic argument.\\n\\n**10.

Cronbach's Alpha is a measure of internal consistency, typically used to assess the reliability of a psychometric instrument or a set of items intended to measure a single construct. This means it requires a dataset where rows represent observations (or \"runs\" in your context) and columns represent the scores for different \"items.\"\n\n**Assumption about Data Structure:**\n\nBased on the requirement for Cronbach's Alpha, we will assume that for each `(filename, model_name)` pair, the `run_results` list contains multiple \"runs,\" and each \"run\" itself is a list or array of numerical scores corresponding to different \"items.\"\n\nFor example:\n`statistical_data['filename1.txt']['model_A'] = [ [score_item1_run1, score_item2_run1, ...], [score_item1_run2, score_item2_run2, ...], ... ]`\n\nIf the data for a model is structured differently (e.g., a single value per run, or complex objects), Cronbach's Alpha would not be applicable directly, or a preprocessing step would be needed to extract item scores.\n\n**Cronbach's Alpha Formula:**\n\nCronbach's Alpha (α) is calculated as:\n$ \\alpha = \\left( \\frac{k}{k-1} \\right) \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma^2_{i}}{\\sigma^2_{T}} \\right) $\nWhere:\n- $k$ is the number of items.\n- $\\sigma^2_{i}$ is the variance of item $i$.\n- $\\sigma^2_{T}$ is the variance of the total scores (sum of scores for all items for each observation).\n\nSince `scipy` does not directly provide a Cronbach's Alpha function, we will implement it using `pandas` for data manipulation and `numpy` (which `pandas` relies on and is typically used alongside `scipy`) for numerical operations like variance calculation.\n\n---\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport json # For pretty printing the results\n\n# Placeholder for the statistical_data dictionary\n# In a real scenario, this dictionary would be populated with your actual data.\n# Example structure for demonstration:\nstatistical_data = {\n    'survey_results.csv': {\n        'model_A_psychometric_items': [\n            [1, 2, 3, 4],  # Run/Observation 1: Scores for 4 items\n            [2, 3, 4, 5],  # Run/Observation 2\n            [1, 2, 3, 4],  # Run/Observation 3\n            [3, 4, 5, 5],  # Run/Observation 4\n            [1, 1, 2, 3],  # Run/Observation 5\n        ],\n        'model_B_attitude_scale': [\n            [5, 4, 3],     # Run/Observation 1: Scores for 3 items\n            [4, 3, 2],\n            [5, 4, 3],\n            [3, 2, 1],\n            [4, 3, 2],\n            [np.nan, 3, 2], # Example with a missing value\n        ],\n        'model_C_single_item_data': [\n            [10],          # Not enough items for Cronbach's Alpha\n            [12],\n            [11],\n        ],\n        'model_D_insufficient_runs': [\n            [1, 2, 3]      # Not enough observations (runs) for variance\n        ],\n        'model_E_empty_data': [], # No data\n        'model_F_non_numeric': [\n            [1, 2, 'a'],\n            [3, 4, 'b']\n        ]\n    },\n    'experiment_data.txt': {\n        'model_X_experimental_measures': [\n            [10.1, 11.2, 9.8, 12.5, 10.0],\n            [10.5, 11.5, 10.0, 12.8, 10.2],\n            [9.9, 11.0, 9.5, 12.0, 9.7],\n            [10.3, 11.3, 9.9, 12.6, 10.1],\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\n# Dictionary to store the results\nstatistical_results = {}\n\ndef calculate_cronbach_alpha(df: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Cronbach's Alpha for a given DataFrame of item scores.\n    Each column is an item, each row is an observation.\n\n    Args:\n        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame where columns are items and rows are observations.\n                           Expected to contain numerical data.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Cronbach's Alpha value, or np.nan if calculation is not possible\n               due to insufficient data or zero variance.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input to calculate_cronbach_alpha must be a pandas DataFrame.\")\n\n    # Convert all columns to numeric, coercing errors to NaN\n    df_numeric = df.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')\n\n    # Drop rows that contain any NaN values after numeric conversion\n    # For Cronbach's Alpha, observations with missing item scores are typically removed.\n    df_clean = df_numeric.dropna()\n\n    num_items = df_clean.shape[1]\n    num_observations = df_clean.shape[0]\n\n    if num_items < 2:\n        print(f\"Warning: Not enough items ({num_items}) to calculate Cronbach's Alpha.
