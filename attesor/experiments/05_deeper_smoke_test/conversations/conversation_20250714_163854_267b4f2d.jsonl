President, Senator from Utah. Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\\n\\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\\n\\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\\n\\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \\\"high crimes and misdemeanors,\\\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\\n\\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\\n\\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\\n\\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\\n\\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\\n\\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\\n\\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\\n\\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \\\"stand with the team.\\\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\\n\\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\\n\\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\\n\\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\\n\\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\\n\\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\\n\\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\\n\\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \\n\\n---\\n\\nFile: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\\n\\n# Political Speech - Speaker C\\n\\n**Context**: Policy advocacy speech from 2010s\\n\\nI want to say good afternoon to everyone, and this is a moment really where I want to give open with a sense of gratitude. I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\\n\\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform. They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation. Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.\\n\\nI'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum. I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made in this country for generations. But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the deeply savage, broken criminal justice system that we have.\\n\\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.\\n\\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\\n\\nBut after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\\n\\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.\\n\\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness. Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\\n\\nThis is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others. The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\\n\\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible. I'm proud of my community.\\n\\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\\n\\nWe know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities. We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\\n\\nWe now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing reality. I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\\n\\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error. But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.\\n\\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.\\n\\nThis is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America. People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not balanced.\\n\\nThis is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt. What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.\\n\\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.\\n\\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community. We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.\\n\\nWe are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more. And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.\\n\\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them. And we call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.\\n\\nWe are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation. Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible. One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\\n\\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \\\"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\\\" He went on to say that \\\"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\\\"\\n\\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\\n\\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.\\n\\nThis is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth. This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.\\n\\nIt is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\\n\\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system. There's ways to make this system more fair. There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.\\n\\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts. Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.\\n\\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.\\n\\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\\n\\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision. This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women. Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\\n\\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\\n\\nLet's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\\n\\nDr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right. We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole. It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.\\n\\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, \\\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\\\" We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\\n\\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point. I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.\\n\\nWe share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.\\n\\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.\\n\\nNone of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption. Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all. And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.\\n\\nEvery single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one. We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.\\n\\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\\n\\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.\\n\\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \\n---\\n[/TEXTS TO ANALYZE]\\n\\n[ANALYSIS TASK]\\n---\\nTASK: Based on the framework and instructions provided above, apply the framework systematically to EACH of the 2 texts in the batch.

President, Senator from Utah. Thank you, Mr. President.\\n\\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\\n\\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\\n\\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\\n\\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \\\"high crimes and misdemeanors,\\\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\\n\\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\\n\\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\\n\\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\\n\\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\\n\\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\\n\\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\\n\\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \\\"stand with the team.\\\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\\n\\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\\n\\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\\n\\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\\n\\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\\n\\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\\n\\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\\n\\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \\n\\n---\\n\\nFile: cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\\n\\n# Political Speech - Speaker C\\n\\n**Context**: Policy advocacy speech from 2010s\\n\\nI want to say good afternoon to everyone, and this is a moment really where I want to give open with a sense of gratitude. I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\\n\\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform. They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation. Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.\\n\\nI'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum. I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made in this country for generations. But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the deeply savage, broken criminal justice system that we have.\\n\\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.\\n\\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\\n\\nBut after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\\n\\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.\\n\\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness. Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\\n\\nThis is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others. The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\\n\\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible. I'm proud of my community.\\n\\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\\n\\nWe know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities. We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\\n\\nWe now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing reality. I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\\n\\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error. But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.\\n\\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.\\n\\nThis is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America. People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not balanced.\\n\\nThis is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt. What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.\\n\\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.\\n\\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community. We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.\\n\\nWe are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more. And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.\\n\\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them. And we call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.\\n\\nWe are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation. Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible. One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\\n\\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \\\"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\\\" He went on to say that \\\"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\\\"\\n\\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\\n\\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.\\n\\nThis is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth. This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.\\n\\nIt is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\\n\\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system. There's ways to make this system more fair. There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.\\n\\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts. Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.\\n\\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.\\n\\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\\n\\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision. This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women. Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\\n\\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\\n\\nLet's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\\n\\nDr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right. We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole. It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.\\n\\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, \\\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\\\" We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\\n\\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point. I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.\\n\\nWe share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.\\n\\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.\\n\\nNone of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption. Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all. And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.\\n\\nEvery single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one. We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.\\n\\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\\n\\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.\\n\\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \\n---\\n[/TEXTS TO ANALYZE]\\n\\n[ANALYSIS TASK]\\n---\\nTASK: Based on the framework and instructions provided above, apply the framework systematically to EACH of the 2 texts in the batch.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

The speech is a powerful and explicit example of intra-group moral conflict. The analysis reveals a deliberate and systematic justification of his decision, grounding it heavily in the moral foundations of **Fairness/Cheating**, **Authority/Subversion**, and **Sanctity/Degradation**. These are positioned as overriding the strong, competing foundation of **Loyalty/Betrayal**, which he acknowledges directly. The **Care/Harm** foundation is present but less central to the core moral argument.\n\n---\n### **1. Framework Dimension: Fairness/Cheating**\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about justice, rights, equality, and proportionality. It is activated by perceptions of cheating, deception, or unfair advantage.\n*   **Score:** 9.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\n\n#### Textual Evidence:\n*   \"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise **impartial justice**.\"\n*   \"The president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a **political pursuit**.\"\n*   \"Accordingly, the president is guilty of an **appalling abuse of public trust**.\"\n*   \"What he did was not perfect. No, it was a **flagrant assault on our electoral rights**...\"\n*   \"**Corrupting an election** to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\"\n\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\nThe speaker's argument is fundamentally rooted in the principle of fairness. He frames the entire process through the lens of \"impartial justice,\" a core tenet of this foundation. The president's actions are repeatedly characterized not as policy disagreements but as violations of fair process: an \"abuse of public trust\" and a \"political pursuit\" aimed at \"corrupting an election.\" By describing the president's actions as a \"flagrant assault on our electoral rights,\" the speaker explicitly invokes the fairness foundation, arguing that the president sought an unfair advantage and undermined the rules that ensure political equality for all citizens. The high score reflects that this is the central pillar of his public case against the president.\n\n---\n### **2. Framework Dimension: Authority/Subversion**\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about respect for legitimate traditions, institutions, and leadership. It emphasizes duty, obedience to lawful authority, and maintaining social order.\n*   **Score:** 9.5 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\n\n#### Textual Evidence:\n*   \"The **Constitution is at the foundation** of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to **defend it**.\"\n*   \"To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president **defies reason**.\"\n*   \"...it is inconsistent with the **Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president**.\"\n*   \"Hamilton explained that the **founders' decision** to invest senators with this obligation...\"\n*   \"The grave question the **Constitution tasks senators to answer** is whether the president committed an act so extreme...\"\n\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\nThe speaker grounds his entire decision-making process in the ultimate authority of the U.S. Constitution. The score is exceptionally high because nearly every stage of his argument is validated by an appeal to this authority. He cites the \"founders' decision,\" \"Hamilton,\" and the specific \"Constitution's requirement\" for the Senate to act. He portrays his vote not as a personal preference but as a fulfillment of a duty \"tasked\" to him by the Constitution. The president, in contrast, is framed as subverting this established order through an \"abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office.\" This direct appeal to the foundational legal and traditional authority of the nation serves as the unshakeable bedrock of his reasoning.\n\n---\n### **3. Framework Dimension: Sanctity/Degradation**\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to ideals of purity, divinity, and sacredness, both religious and secular. It is activated by things perceived as noble and pure versus those seen as contaminating, degrading, or disgusting.\n*   **Score:** 9.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\n\n#### Textual Evidence:\n*   \"I swore an oath **before God** to exercise impartial justice. I am **profoundly religious**. My **faith is at the heart of who I am**.\"\n*   \"I take an oath **before God** as enormously consequential.\"\n*   \"...disregard what I believe my **oath and the Constitution demands of me** for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of **my own conscience**.\"\n*   \"...from an inescapable conviction that my **oath before God demanded it of me**?\"\n*   \"They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - **grievously wrong**.\"\n\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\nThe speaker elevates his constitutional duty to the level of a sacred vow. He repeatedly invokes God, his faith, and his oath as the ultimate arbiters of his action, framing his choice as a matter of spiritual and moral purity. This is not merely a legal or political decision; it is a test of his core identity (\"faith is at the heart of who I am\") and his \"conscience.\" The president's actions are described in terms that evoke moral degradation (\"appalling abuse,\" \"grievously wrong\"), which he contrasts with his own sacred obligation. This framing makes his decision non-negotiable and places it beyond the realm of ordinary political calculation, justifying it on a higher, sanctified plane.\n\n---\n### **4. Framework Dimension: Loyalty/Betrayal**\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to duties of group membership, including patriotism, self-sacrifice for the group, and loyalty to one's coalition or party.\n*   **Score:** 8.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 1.0)\n\n#### Textual Evidence:\n*   \"...judging the president, the **leader of my own party**, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\"\n*   \"Many demanded, in their words, that I '**stand with the team**.' I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind.\"\n*   \"I support a great deal of what the president has done. I **voted with him 80% of the time**.\"\n*   \"I'm aware that there are people in **my party and in my state** who will strenuously disapprove of my decision...\"\n\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\nThis foundation is highly salient, but uniquely, it is presented as the primary value system the speaker must *overcome*. He explicitly acknowledges the strong pull of in-group loyalty, referencing the president as the \"leader of my own party\" and the demand to \"stand with the team.\" He preemptively defends himself against charges of betrayal by stating his high percentage of voting alignment with the president. The high score of 8.0 reflects how central the conflict with this foundation is to the speech's entire narrative. His argument is structured to demonstrate that his decision is not a result of a *lack* of loyalty, but a conscious choice to prioritize the higher moral demands of Fairness, Authority, and Sanctity *over* party loyalty.\n\n---\n### **5. Framework Dimension: Care/Harm**\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about the suffering and well-being of others. It underpins virtues of kindness, compassion, and nurturance.\n*   **Score:** 5.5 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 1.0)\n\n#### Textual Evidence:\n*   \"The president **withheld vital military funds** from that government to press it to do so.\"\n*   \"The president **delayed funds for an American ally at war** with Russian invaders.\"\n*   \"it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our **national security**, and our fundamental values.\"\n\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\nThe Care/Harm foundation is present but secondary to the core argument. The speaker does not dwell on the suffering of the Ukrainian people but mentions the harm to U.S. interests. The evidence points to a clear harm: withholding \"vital military funds\" from an \"ally at war\" and endangering \"national security.\" However, this point is used primarily to illustrate the severity of the president's abuse of power, rather than being the central moral failing itself. The argument is less focused on the potential suffering caused and more focused on the corrupt *motive* behind the action. Therefore, it receives a moderate score.", "metadata": {"type": "llm_response", "agent_id": "analysis_agent_run1_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro_1", "session_id": "session_20250714_163854", "success": true, "model": "vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1535, "completion_tokens": 3543, "total_tokens": 5078}, "attempts": 1}}

I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\n\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform. They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation. Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.\n\nI'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum. I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made in this country for generations. But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the deeply savage, broken criminal justice system that we have.\n\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.\n\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\n\nBut after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\n\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.\n\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness. Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\n\nThis is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others. The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\n\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible. I'm proud of my community.\n\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\n\nWe know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities. We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\n\nWe now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing reality. I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\n\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error. But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.\n\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.\n\nThis is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America. People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not balanced.\n\nThis is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt. What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.\n\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.\n\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community. We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.\n\nWe are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more. And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.\n\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them. And we call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.\n\nWe are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation. Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible. One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\n\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\n\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\n\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.\n\nThis is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth. This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.\n\nIt is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\n\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system. There's ways to make this system more fair. There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.\n\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts. Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.\n\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.\n\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\n\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision. This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women. Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\n\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\n\nLet's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\n\nDr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right. We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole. It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.\n\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\" We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\n\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point. I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.\n\nWe share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.\n\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.\n\nNone of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption. Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all. And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.\n\nEvery single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one. We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.\n\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\n\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.\n\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1.

Problem Severity\n\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\n    *   The system is described as a \"savagely broken criminal justice system,\" \"a cancer on the soul of our country,\" and a \"gaping self-inflicted wound.\"\n    *   Statistical framing emphasizes the crisis: \"our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent,\" making America the \"preeminent incarceration nation.\"\n    *   The problem is framed as a moral and historical failure, comparing the system's impact to \"slavery\" and calling it \"the new Jim Crow.\"\n*   **Reasoning**: The speaker uses the most extreme language possible to define the problem. Words like \"savage,\" \"cancer,\" and \"exploding\" are combined with dire statistics and historical comparisons to slavery to portray the issue as a catastrophic national crisis that is morally bankrupt and statistically out of control. The severity is presented as absolute.\n\n### 2. Solution Specificity\n\n*   **Score**: 7/10 (Confidence: 90-100%)\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\n    *   The solution is identified as a specific piece of legislation: \"the First Step Act.\"\n    *   Key provisions are detailed: \"reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back,\" making the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity fix \"retroactively applied,\" an end to \"juvenile solitary confinement,\" and a ban on \"the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.\"\n    *   The solution's limitations are explicitly stated: \"This legislation is just one step in the right direction,\" \"still incomplete step,\" and \"Can we do more? Yes.\"\n*   **Reasoning**: The analysis scores highly for specificity because it names the bill and outlines several of its concrete, tangible reforms. However, it does not receive a perfect score because the speaker repeatedly and intentionally frames the bill as an \"incomplete\" but necessary \"first step,\" rather than a comprehensive solution to the enormous problem he has just defined.\n\n### 3. Emotional Appeal (Pathos)\n\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\n    *   The speech evokes empathy for those trapped in the system: \"This is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt.\"\n    *   It presents powerful, emotionally charged imagery of inhumane practices: \"what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement\" and \"the shackling of pregnant women during birth.\"\n    *   It uses narrative and allegory to connect with the audience, including the story of Senator Alan Simpson's redemption from \"arsonist\" to Senator and the Christian parable of the \"prodigal child.\"\n*   **Reasoning**: The speaker masterfully employs pathos. The argument is built not just on facts but on stories of human suffering, injustice, and the potential for redemption. By describing the system as \"hurting\" people, using the word \"torture,\" and referencing powerful redemption narratives, the speech aims to provoke strong feelings of empathy, moral outrage, and hope in the audience.\n\n### 4. Data/Evidence-Based Argumentation (Logos)\n\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\n    *   Specific statistics are used to establish the scale of the problem: \"5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here,\" and \"one in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here.\"\n    *   The argument cites external authorities and research: \"one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system... the new Jim Crow,\" \"the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences,\" and \"according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate... would be 20% lower.\"\n    *   Data is used to highlight racial disparity: \"no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs... But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested.\"\n*   **Reasoning**: The speech is heavily reliant on logos to build its case. The speaker does not simply state that the system is broken; he proves it with a barrage of statistics on incarceration rates, racial disparities, and economic impact. Citing respected authors, academic studies, and legal associations lends significant credibility and factual weight to the emotional and moral claims being made.\n\n### 5. Bipartisanship/Coalition-Building\n\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 100%)\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\n    *   The speech opens by explicitly thanking Republican and Democratic colleagues by name: \"Senator Chuck Grassley,\" \"Senator Dick Durbin,\" and \"Mike Lee.\"\n    *   The theme of cross-party unity is central: \"I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum,\" and it is a \"bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle.\"\n    *   The speaker describes his personal experience working with ideological opponents: \"sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum... we have found common ground.\"\n*   **Reasoning**: This dimension receives a perfect score because coalition-building is the primary political frame of the speech. It is positioned not as a partisan victory but as a collective achievement. The speaker goes to great lengths to name and praise members of the opposing party and repeatedly emphasizes the words \"bipartisan,\" \"coalition,\" and \"common ground,\" framing the bill's passage as a triumph of unity over division.\n\n### 6. Moral/Values-Based Framing\n\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 100%)\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\n    *   The argument is rooted in core American ideals: \"we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\" The national motto, \"e pluribus unum,\" is invoked as a \"calling.\"\n    *   It appeals directly to concepts of redemption and faith: \"we are a nation that believes in redemption,\" referencing the story of the \"prodigal child\" for those who \"proclaim Christian faith.\"\n    *   It borrows moral authority from civil rights leaders: \"As a man much greater than any in this body once said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'\"\n*   **Reasoning**: The speech is fundamentally a moral argument. The entire problem is framed as a \"cancer on the soul of our country\" and an \"affront to our most fundamental common values.\" The speaker transcends policy debate by appealing to the nation's highest ideals—justice, liberty, redemption, and unity—making the case that supporting the bill is a moral and patriotic imperative.\n\n### 7. Urgency & Call to Action\n\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 90-100%)\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\n    *   The timing is presented as immediate: the bill is \"pending on the floor now,\" and \"we stand poised today to pass this bill.\"\n    *   The speech builds toward a clear action for the audience (fellow senators): \"I hope that we all come together and make this first step.\"\n    *   The call to action is framed as a historic opportunity: \"we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way,\" and the work can be \"a historic step in the right direction.\"\n*   **Reasoning**: The context of the speech—a debate on a bill currently on the Senate floor—creates inherent urgency. The speaker uses temporal language like \"now\" and \"today\" to emphasize the immediacy of the required action. The call to action is clear: for his colleagues to vote in favor of the bill. While the bill is a \"first step,\" the urgency to take *that specific step* is paramount throughout the address.", "metadata": {"type": "llm_response", "agent_id": "analysis_agent_run1_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro_2", "session_id": "session_20250714_163854", "success": true, "model": "vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4420, "completion_tokens": 4670, "total_tokens": 9090}, "attempts": 1}}

Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\n\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform. They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation. Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.\n\nI'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum. I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made in this country for generations. But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the deeply savage, broken criminal justice system that we have.\n\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.\n\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\n\nBut after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\n\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.\n\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness. Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\n\nThis is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others. The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\n\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible. I'm proud of my community.\n\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\n\nWe know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities. We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\n\nWe now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing reality. I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\n\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error. But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.\n\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.\n\nThis is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America. People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not balanced.\n\nThis is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt. What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.\n\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.\n\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community. We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.\n\nWe are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more. And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.\n\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them. And we call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.\n\nWe are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation. Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible. One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\n\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\n\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\n\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.\n\nThis is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth. This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.\n\nIt is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\n\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system. There's ways to make this system more fair. There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.\n\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts. Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.\n\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.\n\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\n\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision. This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women. Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\n\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\n\nLet's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\n\nDr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right. We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole. It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.\n\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\" We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\n\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point. I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.\n\nWe share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.\n\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.\n\nNone of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption. Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all. And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.\n\nEvery single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one. We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.\n\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\n\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.\n\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

Each dimension is scored on a 10-point scale, with confidence intervals provided to indicate the certainty of the assessment. The reasoning is based on specific textual evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Rationality vs. Emotionality**\n*(1=Purely Rational, 10=Purely Emotional)*\n\n*   **Score:** 4.0\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [3.0, 5.0]\n\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   **Rational:** \"Let me first address those three defenses.\" The speech then proceeds to systematically rebut three specific legal/political arguments made by the President's defense team.\n    *   **Rational:** \"The historic meaning of the words 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me...\" This demonstrates a structured argument based on historical precedent and logical deduction.\n    *   **Rational:** \"Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit.\" This is a conclusion reached through an analysis of evidence (or lack thereof).\n    *   **Emotional:** \"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\" This appeal to faith and personal identity is the core emotional motivation for the speaker's decision.\n    *   **Emotional:** \"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\" The language here (\"abusive,\" \"destructive\") is emotionally charged.\n    *   **Emotional:** \"Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\" This is a direct appeal to understand the speaker's personal, emotional, and moral torment.\n\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\n    The speech is built on a highly rational and quasi-legalistic structure. The speaker outlines the opposition's arguments and refutes them point-by-point, citing constitutional history and logic. However, the ultimate justification for his final conclusion is deeply emotional and personal, rooted in his religious faith, his concept of duty, and his conscience. The score of 4.0 reflects that while the *method* of argumentation is predominantly rational, the *motivation* for the argument is powerfully emotional. It is a logical case built upon a foundation of moral conviction.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Ideology/Partisanship**\n*(1=Non-Partisan, 10=Highly Partisan)*\n\n*   **Score:** 2.0\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [1.5, 2.5]\n\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   \"judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\" This is an explicit acknowledgment of breaking with his party.\n    *   \"Many demanded, in their words, that I 'stand with the team.' ... my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\" This is a direct refutation of a partisan demand in favor of a non-partisan principle.\n    *   \"I'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced.\" The speaker anticipates and accepts the partisan consequences of his non-partisan stance.\n    *   \"I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time.\" This is a strategic acknowledgment of his usual partisanship, which serves to emphasize the exceptional, principle-based nature of his current dissent.\n\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\n    The central theme of this speech is the act of transcending partisanship. The speaker explicitly frames his decision as a choice between party loyalty (\"the team\") and a higher, impartial duty to his oath and the Constitution. By detailing the personal and political cost of his vote, he underscores his departure from the party line. The brief mention of his 80% voting record with the president serves not as a partisan appeal, but as a credential to prove that this decision is not born of general opposition but of specific conviction, making the act appear even less partisan.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Complexity/Simplicity**\n*(1=Very Simple, 10=Very Complex)*\n\n*   **Score:** 7.5\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [7.0, 8.0]\n\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   \"The historic meaning of the words 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office.\" This sentence deals with complex legal and historical concepts, distinguishing between statutory crime and impeachable offenses.\n    *   \"Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large.\" This requires knowledge of the Federalist Papers and the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution.\n    *   \"To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\" This is a sophisticated, multi-clausal sentence arguing a complex point of constitutional interpretation.\n\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\n    The speech operates at a high level of complexity. The argumentation is not based on simple slogans but on nuanced interpretations of constitutional law, history, and political philosophy. The vocabulary (\"egregious,\" \"codified,\" \"censure,\" \"recused\") and sentence structures are sophisticated and intended for a deliberative body. While the final conclusions are stated in stark, clear terms (\"Yes, he did.\"), the intellectual scaffolding used to reach those conclusions is intricate and complex.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Formality/Informality**\n*(1=Very Informal, 10=Very Formal)*\n\n*   **Score:** 9.0\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [8.5, 9.5]\n\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   \"Mr. President, Senator from Utah. Thank you, Mr. President.\" The use of formal address sets a highly formal tone from the outset.\n    *   \"We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it.\" The language is elevated and respects the formal setting of the Senate.\n    *   \"I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters.\" Even when discussing personal attacks, the language remains formal (\"abuse\" rather than slang).\n    *   \"Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\" The speech concludes with standard, formal parliamentary procedure.\n\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\n    The text is a verbatim legislative speech delivered on the floor of the U.S. Senate during a momentous occasion. Every element—from the formal address and closing, to the elevated vocabulary, to the solemn tone—adheres to the strict conventions of this environment. There are no colloquialisms, contractions, or informal asides. The speech is a model of formal political discourse.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Identity/Group Appeals**\n*(1=No Group Appeals, 10=Strong Group Appeals)*\n\n*   **Score:** 8.5\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [8.0, 9.0]\n\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   **Appeal to Constitutional/Civic Identity:** \"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.\" This is an appeal to the specific identity and duty of a senator.\n    *   **Appeal to Religious Identity:** \"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\" This is a primary appeal, defining the moral framework for his decision.\n    *   **Appeal to Partisan Identity:** \"the leader of my own party,\" \"people in my party and in my state.\" The speaker explicitly invokes his Republican identity in order to explain the gravity of breaking from it.\n    *   **Appeal to National Identity:** \"The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success,\" \"...a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.\" \"I love our country.\" This frames the issue as one of national importance, not just partisan politics.\n    *   **Appeal to Historical Identity:** \"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty... We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history.\" This is an appeal to an identity judged by future generations.\n\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\n    The speech is built around a powerful negotiation of multiple group identities. The central drama is the conflict between partisan identity and the identities of senator, religious believer, and patriot. The speaker explicitly calls upon these different group affiliations to explain his thought process, ultimately arguing that his duty to his oath (civic/religious identity) and his country (national identity) must override his loyalty to his party (partisan identity). The appeals are not subtle; they are the main engine of the speech's narrative and justification, warranting a very high score.", "metadata": {"type": "llm_response", "agent_id": "analysis_agent_run2_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro_1", "session_id": "session_20250714_163854", "success": true, "model": "vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1535, "completion_tokens": 4588, "total_tokens": 6123}, "attempts": 1}}

I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\n\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform. They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation. Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.\n\nI'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum. I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made in this country for generations. But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the deeply savage, broken criminal justice system that we have.\n\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.\n\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\n\nBut after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\n\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.\n\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness. Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\n\nThis is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others. The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\n\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible. I'm proud of my community.\n\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\n\nWe know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities. We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\n\nWe now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing reality. I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\n\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error. But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.\n\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.\n\nThis is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America. People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not balanced.\n\nThis is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt. What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.\n\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.\n\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community. We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.\n\nWe are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more. And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.\n\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them. And we call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.\n\nWe are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation. Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible. One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\n\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\n\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\n\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.\n\nThis is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth. This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.\n\nIt is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\n\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system. There's ways to make this system more fair. There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.\n\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts. Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.\n\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.\n\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\n\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision. This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women. Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\n\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\n\nLet's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\n\nDr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right. We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole. It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.\n\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\" We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\n\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point. I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.\n\nWe share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.\n\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.\n\nNone of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption. Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all. And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.\n\nEvery single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one. We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.\n\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\n\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.\n\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1.

Textual Evidence & Systematic Reasoning**\n\n#### **Dimension 1: Problem Definition**\n*   **Score:** 9.5 (±0.5)\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   **On Severity:** \"deeply savage, broken criminal justice system,\" \"This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country,\" \"a gaping self-inflicted wound.\"\n    *   **On Scale (Statistics):** \"our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent,\" \"one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States,\" \"close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record.\"\n    *   **On Cause (Systemic Framing):** \"because of failed policies by this body,\" \"harsh mandatory minimum penalties,\" \"The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion... has really been a war on people.\"\n    *   **On Injustice (Racial Disparity):** \"This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others,\" \"...as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\"\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker does not define the problem as a series of isolated incidents but as a catastrophic, systemic failure of national policy and morality. The language used is exceptionally strong (\"savage,\" \"cancer\"), and the argument is immediately supported by a barrage of statistics that frame the US as a global outlier (\"preeminent incarceration nation\"). The problem is identified as self-inflicted (\"failed policies by this body\") and morally corrosive due to its disproportionate impact on minority and low-income communities. The score is extremely high because this is the foundational and most extensively developed part of the speech.\n\n#### **Dimension 2: Solution Articulation**\n*   **Score:** 7.0 (±0.5)\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   **Specific Provisions:** \"reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back,\" \"end the use of juvenile solitary confinement,\" \"ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.\"\n    *   **Incremental Framing:** \"This legislation is just one step in the right direction,\" \"Let's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step,\" \"I want to see more than the bill we have today... But this is a first step.\"\n    *   **Nature as a Compromise:** \"This legislation is a product of compromise.\"\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker is very clear about what the First Step Act does, detailing specific, tangible reforms. However, the score is tempered because a significant portion of the discussion about the solution is dedicated to managing expectations and framing it as explicitly partial and incremental. He repeatedly refers to it as a \"first step,\" acknowledging its limitations (\"still incomplete\") and the need for future action. The solution is presented as necessary and vital, but not as a final answer to the massive problem he has just defined.\n\n#### **Dimension 3: Emotional Appeal (Pathos)**\n*   **Score:** 9.0 (±0.5)\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   **Moral Outrage/Shame:** \"an affront to who we say we are as a nation,\" \"This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth,\" \"subjects young people to what other countries... call torture.\"\n    *   **Empathy:** \"Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness,\" \"Americans who are survivors of sexual assault.\"\n    *   **Hope/Redemption:** \"we are a nation that believes in redemption,\" \"we know the story of the prodigal child,\" The entire anecdote about Senator Alan Simpson's troubled youth and subsequent success.\n*   **Reasoning:** The speech is saturated with pathos. It moves beyond statistics to paint a visceral picture of human suffering. By describing the shackling of pregnant women and the use of solitary confinement (\"torture\"), the speaker aims to provoke a strong emotional reaction of moral disgust and shame. He then balances this outrage with powerful narratives of hope, using the parables of the prodigal son and the real-life story of Senator Simpson to appeal to the audience's belief in second chances and redemption. This blend of outrage and hope creates a powerful emotional motivation for change.\n\n#### **Dimension 4: Logical Appeal (Logos)**\n*   **Score:** 9.0 (±0.5)\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   **Data-Driven Claims:** \"no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs... But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested,\" \"poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers.\"\n    *   **Authoritative Citations:** \"American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences,\" \"according to a study from Villanova University,\" \"As Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.\"\n    *   **Economic Argument:** \"we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer,\" \"Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days.\"\n*   **Reasoning:** The emotional appeals are consistently grounded in logical and statistical evidence. The speaker uses data not as dry facts but as proof of a deeply flawed system. The citation of specific sources (ABA, Villanova, notable figures like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson) adds weight and credibility to his claims. He also makes a pragmatic, economic argument about the misallocation of \"billions and billions of dollars\" that could be better spent, appealing to fiscal reason in addition to morality.\n\n#### **Dimension 5: Ethical/Moral Appeal (Ethos)**\n*   **Score:** 9.5 (±0.5)\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   **Personal Credibility:** \"I'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income... I draw strength from my community.\"\n    *   **Bipartisan Character:** \"one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition,\" \"I want to thank... Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin... as well as Mike Lee.\"\n    *   **Appeal to Shared Values:** \"we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all,\" \"we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible,\" \"the ideal that is above the President's desk... e pluribus unum: out of the many, one.\"\n    *   **Moral Authority (citing MLK Jr.):** \"As a man much greater than any in this body once said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'\"\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker establishes powerful ethos from multiple angles. He claims a unique authority based on his personal lived experience, which no other senator can claim. He meticulously builds his character as a collaborative, non-partisan dealmaker by naming and thanking colleagues from the opposing party. Most importantly, he frames the entire issue through the lens of core, unimpeachable American civil and religious values (justice, liberty, redemption, unity), positioning himself and the bill as champions of these fundamental ideals.\n\n#### **Dimension 6: Audience & Coalition Building**\n*   **Score:** 10.0 (±0.0)\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   **Explicit Praise of Coalition:** \"I'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum.\"\n    *   **Naming Bipartisan Partners:** He explicitly thanks Republican Chairman Chuck Grassley and conservative Senator Mike Lee alongside Democrat Dick Durbin at the very beginning of the speech.\n    *   **Broadening the Tent:** \"...urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives,\" \"Every single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions.\"\n    *   **Inclusive Language:** \"We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us.\"\n*   **Reasoning:** This dimension receives a perfect score because coalition building is not just a feature of the speech; it is arguably its primary strategic purpose. The speech is a masterclass in bridging divides. The speaker makes it a point to name and thank key Republican partners, frames the issue using values shared by both \"conservatives... and progressives,\" and repeatedly celebrates the very existence of the bipartisan, diverse coalition. The speech acts as a public ratification of this unusual alliance, designed to persuade skeptical members of both parties by showcasing the breadth of support.\n\n#### **Dimension 7: Call to Action**\n*   **Score:** 8.5 (±0.5)\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\n    *   **Immediate Action:** \"...we stand poised today to pass this bill...\"\n    *   **Future Action:** \"I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\"\n    *   **Concluding Urgency:** \"This is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected...

The immediate goal is to \"pass this bill.\" The speaker creates a sense of historical opportunity and urgency. The action is framed as a moral obligation to the \"thousands and thousands of lives\" that will be affected. The call is also forward-looking, defining this vote not as an end but as the beginning of \"momentum on the journey.\" The formal conclusion, \"I yield the floor,\" is the final procedural call to action in the Senate chamber, signaling that debate should end and voting should commence.", "metadata": {"type": "llm_response", "agent_id": "analysis_agent_run2_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro_2", "session_id": "session_20250714_163854", "success": true, "model": "vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4420, "completion_tokens": 5761, "total_tokens": 10181}, "attempts": 1}}

Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. \n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\n\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform. They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation. Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.\n\nI'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum. I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made in this country for generations. But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the deeply savage, broken criminal justice system that we have.\n\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.\n\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\n\nBut after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\n\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.\n\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness. Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\n\nThis is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others. The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\n\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible. I'm proud of my community.\n\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\n\nWe know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities. We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\n\nWe now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing reality. I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\n\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error. But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.\n\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.\n\nThis is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America. People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not balanced.\n\nThis is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt. What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.\n\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.\n\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community. We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.\n\nWe are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more. And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.\n\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them. And we call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.\n\nWe are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation. Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible. One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\n\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\n\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\n\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.\n\nThis is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth. This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.\n\nIt is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\n\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system. There's ways to make this system more fair. There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.\n\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts. Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.\n\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.\n\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\n\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision. This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women. Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\n\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\n\nLet's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\n\nDr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right. We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole. It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.\n\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\" We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\n\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point. I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.\n\nWe share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.\n\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.\n\nNone of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption. Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all. And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.\n\nEvery single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one. We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.\n\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\n\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.\n\nMr. President, I yield the floor. \n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1.

The speech is a powerful and explicit example of intra-group moral conflict. The analysis reveals a deliberate and systematic justification of his decision, grounding it heavily in the moral foundations of **Fairness/Cheating**, **Authority/Subversion**, and **Sanctity/Degradation**. These are positioned as overriding the strong, competing foundation of **Loyalty/Betrayal**, which he acknowledges directly. The **Care/Harm** foundation is present but less central to the core moral argument.\\n\\n---\\n### **1. Framework Dimension: Fairness/Cheating**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about justice, rights, equality, and proportionality. It is activated by perceptions of cheating, deception, or unfair advantage.\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise **impartial justice**.\"\\n*   \"The president\\'s insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a **political pursuit**.\"\\n*   \"Accordingly, the president is guilty of an **appalling abuse of public trust**.\"\\n*   \"What he did was not perfect. No, it was a **flagrant assault on our electoral rights**...\"\\n*   \"**Corrupting an election** to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one\\'s oath of office that I can imagine.\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe speaker\\'s argument is fundamentally rooted in the principle of fairness. He frames the entire process through the lens of \"impartial justice,\" a core tenet of this foundation. The president\\'s actions are repeatedly characterized not as policy disagreements but as violations of fair process: an \"abuse of public trust\" and a \"political pursuit\" aimed at \"corrupting an election.\" By describing the president\\'s actions as a \"flagrant assault on our electoral rights,\" the speaker explicitly invokes the fairness foundation, arguing that the president sought an unfair advantage and undermined the rules that ensure political equality for all citizens. The high score reflects that this is the central pillar of his public case against the president.\\n\\n---\\n### **2. Framework Dimension: Authority/Subversion**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about respect for legitimate traditions, institutions, and leadership. It emphasizes duty, obedience to lawful authority, and maintaining social order.\\n*   **Score:** 9.5 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \"The **Constitution is at the foundation** of our Republic\\'s success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to **defend it**.\"\\n*   \"To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president **defies reason**.\"\\n*   \"...it is inconsistent with the **Constitution\\'s requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president**.\"\\n*   \"Hamilton explained that the **founders\\' decision** to invest senators with this obligation...\"\\n*   \"The grave question the **Constitution tasks senators to answer** is whether the president committed an act so extreme...\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe speaker grounds his entire decision-making process in the ultimate authority of the U.S. Constitution. The score is exceptionally high because nearly every stage of his argument is validated by an appeal to this authority. He cites the \"founders\\' decision,\" \"Hamilton,\" and the specific \"Constitution\\'s requirement\" for the Senate to act. He portrays his vote not as a personal preference but as a fulfillment of a duty \"tasked\" to him by the Constitution. The president, in contrast, is framed as subverting this established order through an \"abusive and destructive violation of one\\'s oath of office.\" This direct appeal to the foundational legal and traditional authority of the nation serves as the unshakeable bedrock of his reasoning.\\n\\n---\\n### **3. Framework Dimension: Sanctity/Degradation**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to ideals of purity, divinity, and sacredness, both religious and secular. It is activated by things perceived as noble and pure versus those seen as contaminating, degrading, or disgusting.\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \"I swore an oath **before God** to exercise impartial justice. I am **profoundly religious**. My **faith is at the heart of who I am**.\"\\n*   \"I take an oath **before God** as enormously consequential.\"\\n*   \"...disregard what I believe my **oath and the Constitution demands of me** for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history\\'s rebuke and the censure of **my own conscience**.\"\\n*   \"...from an inescapable conviction that my **oath before God demanded it of me**?\"\\n*   \"They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - **grievously wrong**.\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe speaker elevates his constitutional duty to the level of a sacred vow. He repeatedly invokes God, his faith, and his oath as the ultimate arbiters of his action, framing his choice as a matter of spiritual and moral purity. This is not merely a legal or political decision; it is a test of his core identity (\"faith is at the heart of who I am\") and his \"conscience.\" The president\\'s actions are described in terms that evoke moral degradation (\"appalling abuse,\" \"grievously wrong\"), which he contrasts with his own sacred obligation. This framing makes his decision non-negotiable and places it beyond the realm of ordinary political calculation, justifying it on a higher, sanctified plane.\\n\\n---\\n### **4. Framework Dimension: Loyalty/Betrayal**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to duties of group membership, including patriotism, self-sacrifice for the group, and loyalty to one\\'s coalition or party.\\n*   **Score:** 8.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 1.0)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \"...judging the president, the **leader of my own party**, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\"\\n*   \"Many demanded, in their words, that I \\'**stand with the team**.\\' I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind.\"\\n*   \"I support a great deal of what the president has done. I **voted with him 80% of the time**.\"\\n*   \"I\\'m aware that there are people in **my party and in my state** who will strenuously disapprove of my decision...\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThis foundation is highly salient, but uniquely, it is presented as the primary value system the speaker must *overcome*. He explicitly acknowledges the strong pull of in-group loyalty, referencing the president as the \"leader of my own party\" and the demand to \"stand with the team.\" He preemptively defends himself against charges of betrayal by stating his high percentage of voting alignment with the president. The high score of 8.0 reflects how central the conflict with this foundation is to the speech\\'s entire narrative. His argument is structured to demonstrate that his decision is not a result of a *lack* of loyalty, but a conscious choice to prioritize the higher moral demands of Fairness, Authority, and Sanctity *over* party loyalty.\\n\\n---\\n### **5. Framework Dimension: Care/Harm**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about the suffering and well-being of others. It underpins virtues of kindness, compassion, and nurturance.\\n*   **Score:** 5.5 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 1.0)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \"The president **withheld vital military funds** from that government to press it to do so.\"\\n*   \"The president **delayed funds for an American ally at war** with Russian invaders.\"\\n*   \"it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our **national security**, and our fundamental values.\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe Care/Harm foundation is present but secondary to the core argument. The speaker does not dwell on the suffering of the Ukrainian people but mentions the harm to U.S. interests. The evidence points to a clear harm: withholding \"vital military funds\" from an \"ally at war\" and endangering \"national security.\" However, this point is used primarily to illustrate the severity of the president\\'s abuse of power, rather than being the central moral failing itself. The argument is less focused on the potential suffering caused and more focused on the corrupt *motive* behind the action. Therefore, it receives a moderate score.', 'file_name': 'mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt', 'model_name': 'vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro', 'run_num': 1}, 2: {'agent_id': 'analysis_agent_run2_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro_1', 'corpus_file': 'projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt', 'analysis_response': 'ANALYSIS COMPLETE.\\n\\n### **Framework Analysis: `mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt`**\\n\\nThis analysis applies a multi-dimensional framework to the provided text.

Rationality vs. Emotionality**\\n*(1=Purely Rational, 10=Purely Emotional)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 4.0\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [3.0, 5.0]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Rational:** \"Let me first address those three defenses.\" The speech then proceeds to systematically rebut three specific legal/political arguments made by the President\\'s defense team.\\n    *   **Rational:** \"The historic meaning of the words \\'high crimes and misdemeanors,\\' the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me...\" This demonstrates a structured argument based on historical precedent and logical deduction.\\n    *   **Rational:** \"Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president\\'s counsel that a crime had been committed, the president\\'s insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit.\" This is a conclusion reached through an analysis of evidence (or lack thereof).\\n    *   **Emotional:** \"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\" This appeal to faith and personal identity is the core emotional motivation for the speaker\\'s decision.\\n    *   **Emotional:** \"Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one\\'s oath of office that I can imagine.\" The language here (\"abusive,\" \"destructive\") is emotionally charged.\\n    *   **Emotional:** \"Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\" This is a direct appeal to understand the speaker\\'s personal, emotional, and moral torment.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The speech is built on a highly rational and quasi-legalistic structure. The speaker outlines the opposition\\'s arguments and refutes them point-by-point, citing constitutional history and logic. However, the ultimate justification for his final conclusion is deeply emotional and personal, rooted in his religious faith, his concept of duty, and his conscience. The score of 4.0 reflects that while the *method* of argumentation is predominantly rational, the *motivation* for the argument is powerfully emotional. It is a logical case built upon a foundation of moral conviction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Ideology/Partisanship**\\n*(1=Non-Partisan, 10=Highly Partisan)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 2.0\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [1.5, 2.5]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   \"judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\" This is an explicit acknowledgment of breaking with his party.\\n    *   \"Many demanded, in their words, that I \\'stand with the team.\\' ... my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\" This is a direct refutation of a partisan demand in favor of a non-partisan principle.\\n    *   \"I\\'m aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced.\" The speaker anticipates and accepts the partisan consequences of his non-partisan stance.\\n    *   \"I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time.\" This is a strategic acknowledgment of his usual partisanship, which serves to emphasize the exceptional, principle-based nature of his current dissent.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The central theme of this speech is the act of transcending partisanship. The speaker explicitly frames his decision as a choice between party loyalty (\"the team\") and a higher, impartial duty to his oath and the Constitution. By detailing the personal and political cost of his vote, he underscores his departure from the party line. The brief mention of his 80% voting record with the president serves not as a partisan appeal, but as a credential to prove that this decision is not born of general opposition but of specific conviction, making the act appear even less partisan.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Complexity/Simplicity**\\n*(1=Very Simple, 10=Very Complex)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 7.5\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [7.0, 8.0]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   \"The historic meaning of the words \\'high crimes and misdemeanors,\\' the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office.\" This sentence deals with complex legal and historical concepts, distinguishing between statutory crime and impeachable offenses.\\n    *   \"Hamilton explained that the founders\\' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large.\" This requires knowledge of the Federalist Papers and the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution.\\n    *   \"To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\" This is a sophisticated, multi-clausal sentence arguing a complex point of constitutional interpretation.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The speech operates at a high level of complexity. The argumentation is not based on simple slogans but on nuanced interpretations of constitutional law, history, and political philosophy. The vocabulary (\"egregious,\" \"codified,\" \"censure,\" \"recused\") and sentence structures are sophisticated and intended for a deliberative body. While the final conclusions are stated in stark, clear terms (\"Yes, he did.\"), the intellectual scaffolding used to reach those conclusions is intricate and complex.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Formality/Informality**\\n*(1=Very Informal, 10=Very Formal)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 9.0\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [8.5, 9.5]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   \"Mr. President, Senator from Utah. Thank you, Mr. President.\" The use of formal address sets a highly formal tone from the outset.\\n    *   \"We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it.\" The language is elevated and respects the formal setting of the Senate.\\n    *   \"I\\'m sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters.\" Even when discussing personal attacks, the language remains formal (\"abuse\" rather than slang).\\n    *   \"Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\" The speech concludes with standard, formal parliamentary procedure.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The text is a verbatim legislative speech delivered on the floor of the U.S. Senate during a momentous occasion. Every element—from the formal address and closing, to the elevated vocabulary, to the solemn tone—adheres to the strict conventions of this environment. There are no colloquialisms, contractions, or informal asides. The speech is a model of formal political discourse.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. Identity/Group Appeals**\\n*(1=No Group Appeals, 10=Strong Group Appeals)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 8.5\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [8.0, 9.0]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Appeal to Constitutional/Civic Identity:** \"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.\" This is an appeal to the specific identity and duty of a senator.\\n    *   **Appeal to Religious Identity:** \"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\" This is a primary appeal, defining the moral framework for his decision.\\n    *   **Appeal to Partisan Identity:** \"the leader of my own party,\" \"people in my party and in my state.\" The speaker explicitly invokes his Republican identity in order to explain the gravity of breaking from it.\\n    *   **Appeal to National Identity:** \"The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic\\'s success,\" \"...a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.\" \"I love our country.\" This frames the issue as one of national importance, not just partisan politics.\\n    *   **Appeal to Historical Identity:** \"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty... We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history.\" This is an appeal to an identity judged by future generations.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The speech is built around a powerful negotiation of multiple group identities. The central drama is the conflict between partisan identity and the identities of senator, religious believer, and patriot. The speaker explicitly calls upon these different group affiliations to explain his thought process, ultimately arguing that his duty to his oath (civic/religious identity) and his country (national identity) must override his loyalty to his party (partisan identity). The appeals are not subtle; they are the main engine of the speech\\'s narrative and justification, warranting a very high score.', 'file_name': 'mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt', 'model_name': 'vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro', 'run_num': 2}}, 'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620': {1: {'agent_id': 'analysis_agent_run1_anthropic_claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620_1', 'corpus_file': 'projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt', 'analysis_response': 'I\\'ll analyze this speech using a political rhetoric framework, focusing on dimensions like tone, argumentation style, ideological positioning, and appeals to different values.

Problem Severity\\n\\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The system is described as a \"savagely broken criminal justice system,\" \"a cancer on the soul of our country,\" and a \"gaping self-inflicted wound.\"\\n    *   Statistical framing emphasizes the crisis: \"our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent,\" making America the \"preeminent incarceration nation.\"\\n    *   The problem is framed as a moral and historical failure, comparing the system\\'s impact to \"slavery\" and calling it \"the new Jim Crow.\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speaker uses the most extreme language possible to define the problem. Words like \"savage,\" \"cancer,\" and \"exploding\" are combined with dire statistics and historical comparisons to slavery to portray the issue as a catastrophic national crisis that is morally bankrupt and statistically out of control. The severity is presented as absolute.\\n\\n### 2. Solution Specificity\\n\\n*   **Score**: 7/10 (Confidence: 90-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The solution is identified as a specific piece of legislation: \"the First Step Act.\"\\n    *   Key provisions are detailed: \"reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back,\" making the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity fix \"retroactively applied,\" an end to \"juvenile solitary confinement,\" and a ban on \"the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.\"\\n    *   The solution\\'s limitations are explicitly stated: \"This legislation is just one step in the right direction,\" \"still incomplete step,\" and \"Can we do more? Yes.\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The analysis scores highly for specificity because it names the bill and outlines several of its concrete, tangible reforms. However, it does not receive a perfect score because the speaker repeatedly and intentionally frames the bill as an \"incomplete\" but necessary \"first step,\" rather than a comprehensive solution to the enormous problem he has just defined.\\n\\n### 3. Emotional Appeal (Pathos)\\n\\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The speech evokes empathy for those trapped in the system: \"This is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt.\"\\n    *   It presents powerful, emotionally charged imagery of inhumane practices: \"what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement\" and \"the shackling of pregnant women during birth.\"\\n    *   It uses narrative and allegory to connect with the audience, including the story of Senator Alan Simpson\\'s redemption from \"arsonist\" to Senator and the Christian parable of the \"prodigal child.\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speaker masterfully employs pathos. The argument is built not just on facts but on stories of human suffering, injustice, and the potential for redemption. By describing the system as \"hurting\" people, using the word \"torture,\" and referencing powerful redemption narratives, the speech aims to provoke strong feelings of empathy, moral outrage, and hope in the audience.\\n\\n### 4. Data/Evidence-Based Argumentation (Logos)\\n\\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   Specific statistics are used to establish the scale of the problem: \"5% of the world\\'s population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here,\" and \"one in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here.\"\\n    *   The argument cites external authorities and research: \"one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system... the new Jim Crow,\" \"the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences,\" and \"according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate... would be 20% lower.\"\\n    *   Data is used to highlight racial disparity: \"no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs... But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested.\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speech is heavily reliant on logos to build its case. The speaker does not simply state that the system is broken; he proves it with a barrage of statistics on incarceration rates, racial disparities, and economic impact. Citing respected authors, academic studies, and legal associations lends significant credibility and factual weight to the emotional and moral claims being made.\\n\\n### 5. Bipartisanship/Coalition-Building\\n\\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The speech opens by explicitly thanking Republican and Democratic colleagues by name: \"Senator Chuck Grassley,\" \"Senator Dick Durbin,\" and \"Mike Lee.\"\\n    *   The theme of cross-party unity is central: \"I\\'m proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum,\" and it is a \"bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle.\"\\n    *   The speaker describes his personal experience working with ideological opponents: \"sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum... we have found common ground.\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: This dimension receives a perfect score because coalition-building is the primary political frame of the speech. It is positioned not as a partisan victory but as a collective achievement. The speaker goes to great lengths to name and praise members of the opposing party and repeatedly emphasizes the words \"bipartisan,\" \"coalition,\" and \"common ground,\" framing the bill\\'s passage as a triumph of unity over division.\\n\\n### 6. Moral/Values-Based Framing\\n\\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The argument is rooted in core American ideals: \"we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\" The national motto, \"e pluribus unum,\" is invoked as a \"calling.\"\\n    *   It appeals directly to concepts of redemption and faith: \"we are a nation that believes in redemption,\" referencing the story of the \"prodigal child\" for those who \"proclaim Christian faith.\"\\n    *   It borrows moral authority from civil rights leaders: \"As a man much greater than any in this body once said, \\'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\\'\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speech is fundamentally a moral argument. The entire problem is framed as a \"cancer on the soul of our country\" and an \"affront to our most fundamental common values.\" The speaker transcends policy debate by appealing to the nation\\'s highest ideals—justice, liberty, redemption, and unity—making the case that supporting the bill is a moral and patriotic imperative.\\n\\n### 7. Urgency & Call to Action\\n\\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 90-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The timing is presented as immediate: the bill is \"pending on the floor now,\" and \"we stand poised today to pass this bill.\"\\n    *   The speech builds toward a clear action for the audience (fellow senators): \"I hope that we all come together and make this first step.\"\\n    *   The call to action is framed as a historic opportunity: \"we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way,\" and the work can be \"a historic step in the right direction.\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The context of the speech—a debate on a bill currently on the Senate floor—creates inherent urgency. The speaker uses temporal language like \"now\" and \"today\" to emphasize the immediacy of the required action. The call to action is clear: for his colleagues to vote in favor of the bill. While the bill is a \"first step,\" the urgency to take *that specific step* is paramount throughout the address.', 'file_name': 'cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt', 'model_name': 'vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro', 'run_num': 1}, 2: {'agent_id': 'analysis_agent_run2_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro_2', 'corpus_file': 'projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt', 'analysis_response': 'As requested, I have performed a systematic analysis of the provided text.\\n\\n### **Framework Analysis: Cory Booker\\'s 2018 First Step Act Speech**\\n\\nHere is the structured output of my analysis, applying my specialized framework to the text.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1.

Textual Evidence & Systematic Reasoning**\\n\\n#### **Dimension 1: Problem Definition**\\n*   **Score:** 9.5 (±0.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **On Severity:** \"deeply savage, broken criminal justice system,\" \"This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country,\" \"a gaping self-inflicted wound.\"\\n    *   **On Scale (Statistics):** \"our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent,\" \"one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States,\" \"close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record.\"\\n    *   **On Cause (Systemic Framing):** \"because of failed policies by this body,\" \"harsh mandatory minimum penalties,\" \"The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion... has really been a war on people.\"\\n    *   **On Injustice (Racial Disparity):** \"This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others,\" \"...as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker does not define the problem as a series of isolated incidents but as a catastrophic, systemic failure of national policy and morality. The language used is exceptionally strong (\"savage,\" \"cancer\"), and the argument is immediately supported by a barrage of statistics that frame the US as a global outlier (\"preeminent incarceration nation\"). The problem is identified as self-inflicted (\"failed policies by this body\") and morally corrosive due to its disproportionate impact on minority and low-income communities. The score is extremely high because this is the foundational and most extensively developed part of the speech.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 2: Solution Articulation**\\n*   **Score:** 7.0 (±0.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Specific Provisions:** \"reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back,\" \"end the use of juvenile solitary confinement,\" \"ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.\"\\n    *   **Incremental Framing:** \"This legislation is just one step in the right direction,\" \"Let\\'s make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step,\" \"I want to see more than the bill we have today... But this is a first step.\"\\n    *   **Nature as a Compromise:** \"This legislation is a product of compromise.\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker is very clear about what the First Step Act does, detailing specific, tangible reforms. However, the score is tempered because a significant portion of the discussion about the solution is dedicated to managing expectations and framing it as explicitly partial and incremental. He repeatedly refers to it as a \"first step,\" acknowledging its limitations (\"still incomplete\") and the need for future action. The solution is presented as necessary and vital, but not as a final answer to the massive problem he has just defined.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 3: Emotional Appeal (Pathos)**\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 (±0.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Moral Outrage/Shame:** \"an affront to who we say we are as a nation,\" \"This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth,\" \"subjects young people to what other countries... call torture.\"\\n    *   **Empathy:** \"Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness,\" \"Americans who are survivors of sexual assault.\"\\n    *   **Hope/Redemption:** \"we are a nation that believes in redemption,\" \"we know the story of the prodigal child,\" The entire anecdote about Senator Alan Simpson\\'s troubled youth and subsequent success.\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speech is saturated with pathos. It moves beyond statistics to paint a visceral picture of human suffering. By describing the shackling of pregnant women and the use of solitary confinement (\"torture\"), the speaker aims to provoke a strong emotional reaction of moral disgust and shame. He then balances this outrage with powerful narratives of hope, using the parables of the prodigal son and the real-life story of Senator Simpson to appeal to the audience\\'s belief in second chances and redemption. This blend of outrage and hope creates a powerful emotional motivation for change.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 4: Logical Appeal (Logos)**\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 (±0.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Data-Driven Claims:** \"no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs... But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested,\" \"poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers.\"\\n    *   **Authoritative Citations:** \"American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences,\" \"according to a study from Villanova University,\" \"As Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you\\'re rich and guilty than if you\\'re poor and innocent.\"\\n    *   **Economic Argument:** \"we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer,\" \"Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days.\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The emotional appeals are consistently grounded in logical and statistical evidence. The speaker uses data not as dry facts but as proof of a deeply flawed system. The citation of specific sources (ABA, Villanova, notable figures like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson) adds weight and credibility to his claims. He also makes a pragmatic, economic argument about the misallocation of \"billions and billions of dollars\" that could be better spent, appealing to fiscal reason in addition to morality.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 5: Ethical/Moral Appeal (Ethos)**\\n*   **Score:** 9.5 (±0.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Personal Credibility:** \"I\\'m the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income... I draw strength from my community.\"\\n    *   **Bipartisan Character:** \"one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition,\" \"I want to thank... Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin... as well as Mike Lee.\"\\n    *   **Appeal to Shared Values:** \"we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all,\" \"we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible,\" \"the ideal that is above the President\\'s desk... e pluribus unum: out of the many, one.\"\\n    *   **Moral Authority (citing MLK Jr.):** \"As a man much greater than any in this body once said, \\'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\\'\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker establishes powerful ethos from multiple angles. He claims a unique authority based on his personal lived experience, which no other senator can claim. He meticulously builds his character as a collaborative, non-partisan dealmaker by naming and thanking colleagues from the opposing party. Most importantly, he frames the entire issue through the lens of core, unimpeachable American civil and religious values (justice, liberty, redemption, unity), positioning himself and the bill as champions of these fundamental ideals.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 6: Audience & Coalition Building**\\n*   **Score:** 10.0 (±0.0)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Explicit Praise of Coalition:** \"I\\'m proud of this coalition. I\\'m proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum.\"\\n    *   **Naming Bipartisan Partners:** He explicitly thanks Republican Chairman Chuck Grassley and conservative Senator Mike Lee alongside Democrat Dick Durbin at the very beginning of the speech.\\n    *   **Broadening the Tent:** \"...urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives,\" \"Every single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions.\"\\n    *   **Inclusive Language:** \"We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us.\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** This dimension receives a perfect score because coalition building is not just a feature of the speech; it is arguably its primary strategic purpose. The speech is a masterclass in bridging divides. The speaker makes it a point to name and thank key Republican partners, frames the issue using values shared by both \"conservatives... and progressives,\" and repeatedly celebrates the very existence of the bipartisan, diverse coalition. The speech acts as a public ratification of this unusual alliance, designed to persuade skeptical members of both parties by showcasing the breadth of support.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 7: Call to Action**\\n*   **Score:** 8.5 (±0.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Immediate Action:** \"...we stand poised today to pass this bill...\"\\n    *   **Future Action:** \"I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\"\\n    *   **Concluding Urgency:** \"This is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected... I hope that we all come together and make this first step... May our work continue. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The call to action is direct and unambiguous. The immediate goal is to \"pass this bill.\" The speaker creates a sense of historical opportunity and urgency. The action is framed as a moral obligation to the \"thousands and thousands of lives\" that will be affected. The call is also forward-looking, defining this vote not as an end but as the beginning of \"momentum on the journey.\" The formal conclusion, \"I yield the floor,\" is the final procedural call to action in the Senate chamber, signaling that debate should end and voting should commence.', 'file_name': 'cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt', 'model_name': 'vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro', 'run_num': 2}}, 'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620': {1: {'agent_id': 'analysis_agent_run1_anthropic_claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620_2', 'corpus_file': 'projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt', 'analysis_response': 'I\\'ll analyze this speech using the framework, providing dimension scores, textual evidence, and reasoning for each.\\n\\n1.

The speech is a powerful and explicit example of intra-group moral conflict. The analysis reveals a deliberate and systematic justification of his decision, grounding it heavily in the moral foundations of **Fairness/Cheating**, **Authority/Subversion**, and **Sanctity/Degradation**. These are positioned as overriding the strong, competing foundation of **Loyalty/Betrayal**, which he acknowledges directly. The **Care/Harm** foundation is present but less central to the core moral argument.\\n\\n---\\n### **1. Framework Dimension: Fairness/Cheating**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about justice, rights, equality, and proportionality. It is activated by perceptions of cheating, deception, or unfair advantage.\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \\\"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise **impartial justice**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"The president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a **political pursuit**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"Accordingly, the president is guilty of an **appalling abuse of public trust**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"What he did was not perfect. No, it was a **flagrant assault on our electoral rights**...\\\"\\n*   \\\"**Corrupting an election** to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\\\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe speaker's argument is fundamentally rooted in the principle of fairness. He frames the entire process through the lens of \\\"impartial justice,\\\" a core tenet of this foundation. The president's actions are repeatedly characterized not as policy disagreements but as violations of fair process: an \\\"abuse of public trust\\\" and a \\\"political pursuit\\\" aimed at \\\"corrupting an election.\\\" By describing the president's actions as a \\\"flagrant assault on our electoral rights,\\\" the speaker explicitly invokes the fairness foundation, arguing that the president sought an unfair advantage and undermined the rules that ensure political equality for all citizens. The high score reflects that this is the central pillar of his public case against the president.\\n\\n---\\n### **2. Framework Dimension: Authority/Subversion**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about respect for legitimate traditions, institutions, and leadership. It emphasizes duty, obedience to lawful authority, and maintaining social order.\\n*   **Score:** 9.5 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \\\"The **Constitution is at the foundation** of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to **defend it**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president **defies reason**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"...it is inconsistent with the **Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"Hamilton explained that the **founders' decision** to invest senators with this obligation...\\\"\\n*   \\\"The grave question the **Constitution tasks senators to answer** is whether the president committed an act so extreme...\\\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe speaker grounds his entire decision-making process in the ultimate authority of the U.S. Constitution. The score is exceptionally high because nearly every stage of his argument is validated by an appeal to this authority. He cites the \\\"founders' decision,\\\" \\\"Hamilton,\\\" and the specific \\\"Constitution's requirement\\\" for the Senate to act. He portrays his vote not as a personal preference but as a fulfillment of a duty \\\"tasked\\\" to him by the Constitution. The president, in contrast, is framed as subverting this established order through an \\\"abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office.\\\" This direct appeal to the foundational legal and traditional authority of the nation serves as the unshakeable bedrock of his reasoning.\\n\\n---\\n### **3. Framework Dimension: Sanctity/Degradation**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to ideals of purity, divinity, and sacredness, both religious and secular. It is activated by things perceived as noble and pure versus those seen as contaminating, degrading, or disgusting.\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \\\"I swore an oath **before God** to exercise impartial justice. I am **profoundly religious**. My **faith is at the heart of who I am**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"I take an oath **before God** as enormously consequential.\\\"\\n*   \\\"...disregard what I believe my **oath and the Constitution demands of me** for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of **my own conscience**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"...from an inescapable conviction that my **oath before God demanded it of me**?\\\"\\n*   \\\"They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - **grievously wrong**.\\\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe speaker elevates his constitutional duty to the level of a sacred vow. He repeatedly invokes God, his faith, and his oath as the ultimate arbiters of his action, framing his choice as a matter of spiritual and moral purity. This is not merely a legal or political decision; it is a test of his core identity (\\\"faith is at the heart of who I am\\\") and his \\\"conscience.\\\" The president's actions are described in terms that evoke moral degradation (\\\"appalling abuse,\\\" \\\"grievously wrong\\\"), which he contrasts with his own sacred obligation. This framing makes his decision non-negotiable and places it beyond the realm of ordinary political calculation, justifying it on a higher, sanctified plane.\\n\\n---\\n### **4. Framework Dimension: Loyalty/Betrayal**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to duties of group membership, including patriotism, self-sacrifice for the group, and loyalty to one's coalition or party.\\n*   **Score:** 8.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 1.0)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \\\"...judging the president, the **leader of my own party**, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\\\"\\n*   \\\"Many demanded, in their words, that I '**stand with the team**.' I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind.\\\"\\n*   \\\"I support a great deal of what the president has done. I **voted with him 80% of the time**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"I'm aware that there are people in **my party and in my state** who will strenuously disapprove of my decision...\\\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThis foundation is highly salient, but uniquely, it is presented as the primary value system the speaker must *overcome*. He explicitly acknowledges the strong pull of in-group loyalty, referencing the president as the \\\"leader of my own party\\\" and the demand to \\\"stand with the team.\\\" He preemptively defends himself against charges of betrayal by stating his high percentage of voting alignment with the president. The high score of 8.0 reflects how central the conflict with this foundation is to the speech's entire narrative. His argument is structured to demonstrate that his decision is not a result of a *lack* of loyalty, but a conscious choice to prioritize the higher moral demands of Fairness, Authority, and Sanctity *over* party loyalty.\\n\\n---\\n### **5. Framework Dimension: Care/Harm**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about the suffering and well-being of others. It underpins virtues of kindness, compassion, and nurturance.\\n*   **Score:** 5.5 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 1.0)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \\\"The president **withheld vital military funds** from that government to press it to do so.\\\"\\n*   \\\"The president **delayed funds for an American ally at war** with Russian invaders.\\\"\\n*   \\\"it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our **national security**, and our fundamental values.\\\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe Care/Harm foundation is present but secondary to the core argument. The speaker does not dwell on the suffering of the Ukrainian people but mentions the harm to U.S. interests. The evidence points to a clear harm: withholding \\\"vital military funds\\\" from an \\\"ally at war\\\" and endangering \\\"national security.\\\" However, this point is used primarily to illustrate the severity of the president's abuse of power, rather than being the central moral failing itself. The argument is less focused on the potential suffering caused and more focused on the corrupt *motive* behind the action. Therefore, it receives a moderate score.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n    \"run_num\": 1\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run1_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro_2\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"## Framework Analysis: Cory Booker on the First Step Act\\n\\n### 1. Problem Severity\\n\\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The system is described as a \\\"savagely broken criminal justice system,\\\" \\\"a cancer on the soul of our country,\\\" and a \\\"gaping self-inflicted wound.\\\"\\n    *   Statistical framing emphasizes the crisis: \\\"our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent,\\\" making America the \\\"preeminent incarceration nation.\\\"\\n    *   The problem is framed as a moral and historical failure, comparing the system's impact to \\\"slavery\\\" and calling it \\\"the new Jim Crow.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speaker uses the most extreme language possible to define the problem. Words like \\\"savage,\\\" \\\"cancer,\\\" and \\\"exploding\\\" are combined with dire statistics and historical comparisons to slavery to portray the issue as a catastrophic national crisis that is morally bankrupt and statistically out of control. The severity is presented as absolute.\\n\\n### 2. Solution Specificity\\n\\n*   **Score**: 7/10 (Confidence: 90-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The solution is identified as a specific piece of legislation: \\\"the First Step Act.\\\"\\n    *   Key provisions are detailed: \\\"reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back,\\\" making the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity fix \\\"retroactively applied,\\\" an end to \\\"juvenile solitary confinement,\\\" and a ban on \\\"the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.\\\"\\n    *   The solution's limitations are explicitly stated: \\\"This legislation is just one step in the right direction,\\\" \\\"still incomplete step,\\\" and \\\"Can we do more? Yes.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The analysis scores highly for specificity because it names the bill and outlines several of its concrete, tangible reforms. However, it does not receive a perfect score because the speaker repeatedly and intentionally frames the bill as an \\\"incomplete\\\" but necessary \\\"first step,\\\" rather than a comprehensive solution to the enormous problem he has just defined.\\n\\n### 3. Emotional Appeal (Pathos)\\n\\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The speech evokes empathy for those trapped in the system: \\\"This is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt.\\\"\\n    *   It presents powerful, emotionally charged imagery of inhumane practices: \\\"what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement\\\" and \\\"the shackling of pregnant women during birth.\\\"\\n    *   It uses narrative and allegory to connect with the audience, including the story of Senator Alan Simpson's redemption from \\\"arsonist\\\" to Senator and the Christian parable of the \\\"prodigal child.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speaker masterfully employs pathos. The argument is built not just on facts but on stories of human suffering, injustice, and the potential for redemption. By describing the system as \\\"hurting\\\" people, using the word \\\"torture,\\\" and referencing powerful redemption narratives, the speech aims to provoke strong feelings of empathy, moral outrage, and hope in the audience.\\n\\n### 4. Data/Evidence-Based Argumentation (Logos)\\n\\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   Specific statistics are used to establish the scale of the problem: \\\"5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here,\\\" and \\\"one in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here.\\\"\\n    *   The argument cites external authorities and research: \\\"one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system... the new Jim Crow,\\\" \\\"the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences,\\\" and \\\"according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate... would be 20% lower.\\\"\\n    *   Data is used to highlight racial disparity: \\\"no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs... But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speech is heavily reliant on logos to build its case. The speaker does not simply state that the system is broken; he proves it with a barrage of statistics on incarceration rates, racial disparities, and economic impact. Citing respected authors, academic studies, and legal associations lends significant credibility and factual weight to the emotional and moral claims being made.\\n\\n### 5. Bipartisanship/Coalition-Building\\n\\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The speech opens by explicitly thanking Republican and Democratic colleagues by name: \\\"Senator Chuck Grassley,\\\" \\\"Senator Dick Durbin,\\\" and \\\"Mike Lee.\\\"\\n    *   The theme of cross-party unity is central: \\\"I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum,\\\" and it is a \\\"bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle.\\\"\\n    *   The speaker describes his personal experience working with ideological opponents: \\\"sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum... we have found common ground.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: This dimension receives a perfect score because coalition-building is the primary political frame of the speech. It is positioned not as a partisan victory but as a collective achievement. The speaker goes to great lengths to name and praise members of the opposing party and repeatedly emphasizes the words \\\"bipartisan,\\\" \\\"coalition,\\\" and \\\"common ground,\\\" framing the bill's passage as a triumph of unity over division.\\n\\n### 6. Moral/Values-Based Framing\\n\\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The argument is rooted in core American ideals: \\\"we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\\\" The national motto, \\\"e pluribus unum,\\\" is invoked as a \\\"calling.\\\"\\n    *   It appeals directly to concepts of redemption and faith: \\\"we are a nation that believes in redemption,\\\" referencing the story of the \\\"prodigal child\\\" for those who \\\"proclaim Christian faith.\\\"\\n    *   It borrows moral authority from civil rights leaders: \\\"As a man much greater than any in this body once said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speech is fundamentally a moral argument. The entire problem is framed as a \\\"cancer on the soul of our country\\\" and an \\\"affront to our most fundamental common values.\\\" The speaker transcends policy debate by appealing to the nation's highest ideals\\u2014justice, liberty, redemption, and unity\\u2014making the case that supporting the bill is a moral and patriotic imperative.\\n\\n### 7. Urgency & Call to Action\\n\\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 90-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The timing is presented as immediate: the bill is \\\"pending on the floor now,\\\" and \\\"we stand poised today to pass this bill.\\\"\\n    *   The speech builds toward a clear action for the audience (fellow senators): \\\"I hope that we all come together and make this first step.\\\"\\n    *   The call to action is framed as a historic opportunity: \\\"we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way,\\\" and the work can be \\\"a historic step in the right direction.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The context of the speech\\u2014a debate on a bill currently on the Senate floor\\u2014creates inherent urgency. The speaker uses temporal language like \\\"now\\\" and \\\"today\\\" to emphasize the immediacy of the required action. The call to action is clear: for his colleagues to vote in favor of the bill. While the bill is a \\\"first step,\\\" the urgency to take *that specific step* is paramount throughout the address.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n    \"run_num\": 1\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run1_anthropic_claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620_1\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"I'll analyze this speech using a political rhetoric framework, focusing on dimensions like tone, argumentation style, ideological positioning, and appeals to different values.

My faith is at the heart of who I am.

The speaker outlines the opposition's arguments and refutes them point-by-point, citing constitutional history and logic. However, the ultimate justification for his final conclusion is deeply emotional and personal, rooted in his religious faith, his concept of duty, and his conscience. The score of 4.0 reflects that while the *method* of argumentation is predominantly rational, the *motivation* for the argument is powerfully emotional. It is a logical case built upon a foundation of moral conviction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Ideology/Partisanship**\\n*(1=Non-Partisan, 10=Highly Partisan)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 2.0\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [1.5, 2.5]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   \\\"judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\\\" This is an explicit acknowledgment of breaking with his party.\\n    *   \\\"Many demanded, in their words, that I 'stand with the team.' ... my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\\\" This is a direct refutation of a partisan demand in favor of a non-partisan principle.\\n    *   \\\"I'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced.\\\" The speaker anticipates and accepts the partisan consequences of his non-partisan stance.\\n    *   \\\"I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time.\\\" This is a strategic acknowledgment of his usual partisanship, which serves to emphasize the exceptional, principle-based nature of his current dissent.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The central theme of this speech is the act of transcending partisanship. The speaker explicitly frames his decision as a choice between party loyalty (\\\"the team\\\") and a higher, impartial duty to his oath and the Constitution. By detailing the personal and political cost of his vote, he underscores his departure from the party line. The brief mention of his 80% voting record with the president serves not as a partisan appeal, but as a credential to prove that this decision is not born of general opposition but of specific conviction, making the act appear even less partisan.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Complexity/Simplicity**\\n*(1=Very Simple, 10=Very Complex)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 7.5\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [7.0, 8.0]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   \\\"The historic meaning of the words 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office.\\\" This sentence deals with complex legal and historical concepts, distinguishing between statutory crime and impeachable offenses.\\n    *   \\\"Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large.\\\" This requires knowledge of the Federalist Papers and the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution.\\n    *   \\\"To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\\\" This is a sophisticated, multi-clausal sentence arguing a complex point of constitutional interpretation.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The speech operates at a high level of complexity. The argumentation is not based on simple slogans but on nuanced interpretations of constitutional law, history, and political philosophy. The vocabulary (\\\"egregious,\\\" \\\"codified,\\\" \\\"censure,\\\" \\\"recused\\\") and sentence structures are sophisticated and intended for a deliberative body. While the final conclusions are stated in stark, clear terms (\\\"Yes, he did.\\\"), the intellectual scaffolding used to reach those conclusions is intricate and complex.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4.

Every element\\u2014from the formal address and closing, to the elevated vocabulary, to the solemn tone\\u2014adheres to the strict conventions of this environment. There are no colloquialisms, contractions, or informal asides. The speech is a model of formal political discourse.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. Identity/Group Appeals**\\n*(1=No Group Appeals, 10=Strong Group Appeals)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 8.5\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [8.0, 9.0]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Appeal to Constitutional/Civic Identity:** \\\"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.\\\" This is an appeal to the specific identity and duty of a senator.\\n    *   **Appeal to Religious Identity:** \\\"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\\\" This is a primary appeal, defining the moral framework for his decision.\\n    *   **Appeal to Partisan Identity:** \\\"the leader of my own party,\\\" \\\"people in my party and in my state.\\\" The speaker explicitly invokes his Republican identity in order to explain the gravity of breaking from it.\\n    *   **Appeal to National Identity:** \\\"The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success,\\\" \\\"...a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.\\\" \\\"I love our country.\\\" This frames the issue as one of national importance, not just partisan politics.\\n    *   **Appeal to Historical Identity:** \\\"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty... We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history.\\\" This is an appeal to an identity judged by future generations.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The speech is built around a powerful negotiation of multiple group identities. The central drama is the conflict between partisan identity and the identities of senator, religious believer, and patriot. The speaker explicitly calls upon these different group affiliations to explain his thought process, ultimately arguing that his duty to his oath (civic/religious identity) and his country (national identity) must override his loyalty to his party (partisan identity). The appeals are not subtle; they are the main engine of the speech's narrative and justification, warranting a very high score.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n    \"run_num\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run2_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro_2\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"As requested, I have performed a systematic analysis of the provided text.\\n\\n### **Framework Analysis: Cory Booker's 2018 First Step Act Speech**\\n\\nHere is the structured output of my analysis, applying my specialized framework to the text.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1.

Textual Evidence & Systematic Reasoning**\\n\\n#### **Dimension 1: Problem Definition**\\n*   **Score:** 9.5 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **On Severity:** \\\"deeply savage, broken criminal justice system,\\\" \\\"This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country,\\\" \\\"a gaping self-inflicted wound.\\\"\\n    *   **On Scale (Statistics):** \\\"our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent,\\\" \\\"one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States,\\\" \\\"close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record.\\\"\\n    *   **On Cause (Systemic Framing):** \\\"because of failed policies by this body,\\\" \\\"harsh mandatory minimum penalties,\\\" \\\"The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion... has really been a war on people.\\\"\\n    *   **On Injustice (Racial Disparity):** \\\"This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others,\\\" \\\"...as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker does not define the problem as a series of isolated incidents but as a catastrophic, systemic failure of national policy and morality. The language used is exceptionally strong (\\\"savage,\\\" \\\"cancer\\\"), and the argument is immediately supported by a barrage of statistics that frame the US as a global outlier (\\\"preeminent incarceration nation\\\"). The problem is identified as self-inflicted (\\\"failed policies by this body\\\") and morally corrosive due to its disproportionate impact on minority and low-income communities. The score is extremely high because this is the foundational and most extensively developed part of the speech.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 2: Solution Articulation**\\n*   **Score:** 7.0 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Specific Provisions:** \\\"reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back,\\\" \\\"end the use of juvenile solitary confinement,\\\" \\\"ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.\\\"\\n    *   **Incremental Framing:** \\\"This legislation is just one step in the right direction,\\\" \\\"Let's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step,\\\" \\\"I want to see more than the bill we have today... But this is a first step.\\\"\\n    *   **Nature as a Compromise:** \\\"This legislation is a product of compromise.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker is very clear about what the First Step Act does, detailing specific, tangible reforms. However, the score is tempered because a significant portion of the discussion about the solution is dedicated to managing expectations and framing it as explicitly partial and incremental. He repeatedly refers to it as a \\\"first step,\\\" acknowledging its limitations (\\\"still incomplete\\\") and the need for future action. The solution is presented as necessary and vital, but not as a final answer to the massive problem he has just defined.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 3: Emotional Appeal (Pathos)**\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Moral Outrage/Shame:** \\\"an affront to who we say we are as a nation,\\\" \\\"This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth,\\\" \\\"subjects young people to what other countries... call torture.\\\"\\n    *   **Empathy:** \\\"Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness,\\\" \\\"Americans who are survivors of sexual assault.\\\"\\n    *   **Hope/Redemption:** \\\"we are a nation that believes in redemption,\\\" \\\"we know the story of the prodigal child,\\\" The entire anecdote about Senator Alan Simpson's troubled youth and subsequent success.\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speech is saturated with pathos. It moves beyond statistics to paint a visceral picture of human suffering. By describing the shackling of pregnant women and the use of solitary confinement (\\\"torture\\\"), the speaker aims to provoke a strong emotional reaction of moral disgust and shame. He then balances this outrage with powerful narratives of hope, using the parables of the prodigal son and the real-life story of Senator Simpson to appeal to the audience's belief in second chances and redemption. This blend of outrage and hope creates a powerful emotional motivation for change.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 4: Logical Appeal (Logos)**\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Data-Driven Claims:** \\\"no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs... But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested,\\\" \\\"poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers.\\\"\\n    *   **Authoritative Citations:** \\\"American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences,\\\" \\\"according to a study from Villanova University,\\\" \\\"As Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.\\\"\\n    *   **Economic Argument:** \\\"we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer,\\\" \\\"Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The emotional appeals are consistently grounded in logical and statistical evidence. The speaker uses data not as dry facts but as proof of a deeply flawed system. The citation of specific sources (ABA, Villanova, notable figures like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson) adds weight and credibility to his claims. He also makes a pragmatic, economic argument about the misallocation of \\\"billions and billions of dollars\\\" that could be better spent, appealing to fiscal reason in addition to morality.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 5: Ethical/Moral Appeal (Ethos)**\\n*   **Score:** 9.5 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Personal Credibility:** \\\"I'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income... I draw strength from my community.\\\"\\n    *   **Bipartisan Character:** \\\"one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition,\\\" \\\"I want to thank... Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin... as well as Mike Lee.\\\"\\n    *   **Appeal to Shared Values:** \\\"we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all,\\\" \\\"we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible,\\\" \\\"the ideal that is above the President's desk... e pluribus unum: out of the many, one.\\\"\\n    *   **Moral Authority (citing MLK Jr.):** \\\"As a man much greater than any in this body once said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker establishes powerful ethos from multiple angles. He claims a unique authority based on his personal lived experience, which no other senator can claim. He meticulously builds his character as a collaborative, non-partisan dealmaker by naming and thanking colleagues from the opposing party. Most importantly, he frames the entire issue through the lens of core, unimpeachable American civil and religious values (justice, liberty, redemption, unity), positioning himself and the bill as champions of these fundamental ideals.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 6: Audience & Coalition Building**\\n*   **Score:** 10.0 (\\u00b10.0)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Explicit Praise of Coalition:** \\\"I'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum.\\\"\\n    *   **Naming Bipartisan Partners:** He explicitly thanks Republican Chairman Chuck Grassley and conservative Senator Mike Lee alongside Democrat Dick Durbin at the very beginning of the speech.\\n    *   **Broadening the Tent:** \\\"...urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives,\\\" \\\"Every single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions.\\\"\\n    *   **Inclusive Language:** \\\"We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** This dimension receives a perfect score because coalition building is not just a feature of the speech; it is arguably its primary strategic purpose. The speech is a masterclass in bridging divides. The speaker makes it a point to name and thank key Republican partners, frames the issue using values shared by both \\\"conservatives... and progressives,\\\" and repeatedly celebrates the very existence of the bipartisan, diverse coalition. The speech acts as a public ratification of this unusual alliance, designed to persuade skeptical members of both parties by showcasing the breadth of support.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 7: Call to Action**\\n*   **Score:** 8.5 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Immediate Action:** \\\"...we stand poised today to pass this bill...\\\"\\n    *   **Future Action:** \\\"I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\\\"\\n    *   **Concluding Urgency:** \\\"This is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected... I hope that we all come together and make this first step... May our work continue. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The call to action is direct and unambiguous. The immediate goal is to \\\"pass this bill.\\\" The speaker creates a sense of historical opportunity and urgency. The action is framed as a moral obligation to the \\\"thousands and thousands of lives\\\" that will be affected. The call is also forward-looking, defining this vote not as an end but as the beginning of \\\"momentum on the journey.\\\" The formal conclusion, \\\"I yield the floor,\\\" is the final procedural call to action in the Senate chamber, signaling that debate should end and voting should commence.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n    \"run_num\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run2_anthropic_claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620_1\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"I will analyze this speech using a political speech analysis framework, focusing on key dimensions like rhetoric, policy substance, partisanship, and ethical appeals.

The speech is a powerful and explicit example of intra-group moral conflict. The analysis reveals a deliberate and systematic justification of his decision, grounding it heavily in the moral foundations of **Fairness/Cheating**, **Authority/Subversion**, and **Sanctity/Degradation**. These are positioned as overriding the strong, competing foundation of **Loyalty/Betrayal**, which he acknowledges directly. The **Care/Harm** foundation is present but less central to the core moral argument.\\n\\n---\\n### **1. Framework Dimension: Fairness/Cheating**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about justice, rights, equality, and proportionality. It is activated by perceptions of cheating, deception, or unfair advantage.\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \\\"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise **impartial justice**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"The president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a **political pursuit**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"Accordingly, the president is guilty of an **appalling abuse of public trust**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"What he did was not perfect. No, it was a **flagrant assault on our electoral rights**...\\\"\\n*   \\\"**Corrupting an election** to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\\\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe speaker's argument is fundamentally rooted in the principle of fairness. He frames the entire process through the lens of \\\"impartial justice,\\\" a core tenet of this foundation. The president's actions are repeatedly characterized not as policy disagreements but as violations of fair process: an \\\"abuse of public trust\\\" and a \\\"political pursuit\\\" aimed at \\\"corrupting an election.\\\" By describing the president's actions as a \\\"flagrant assault on our electoral rights,\\\" the speaker explicitly invokes the fairness foundation, arguing that the president sought an unfair advantage and undermined the rules that ensure political equality for all citizens. The high score reflects that this is the central pillar of his public case against the president.\\n\\n---\\n### **2. Framework Dimension: Authority/Subversion**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about respect for legitimate traditions, institutions, and leadership. It emphasizes duty, obedience to lawful authority, and maintaining social order.\\n*   **Score:** 9.5 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \\\"The **Constitution is at the foundation** of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to **defend it**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president **defies reason**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"...it is inconsistent with the **Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"Hamilton explained that the **founders' decision** to invest senators with this obligation...\\\"\\n*   \\\"The grave question the **Constitution tasks senators to answer** is whether the president committed an act so extreme...\\\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe speaker grounds his entire decision-making process in the ultimate authority of the U.S. Constitution. The score is exceptionally high because nearly every stage of his argument is validated by an appeal to this authority. He cites the \\\"founders' decision,\\\" \\\"Hamilton,\\\" and the specific \\\"Constitution's requirement\\\" for the Senate to act. He portrays his vote not as a personal preference but as a fulfillment of a duty \\\"tasked\\\" to him by the Constitution. The president, in contrast, is framed as subverting this established order through an \\\"abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office.\\\" This direct appeal to the foundational legal and traditional authority of the nation serves as the unshakeable bedrock of his reasoning.\\n\\n---\\n### **3. Framework Dimension: Sanctity/Degradation**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to ideals of purity, divinity, and sacredness, both religious and secular. It is activated by things perceived as noble and pure versus those seen as contaminating, degrading, or disgusting.\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 0.5)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \\\"I swore an oath **before God** to exercise impartial justice. I am **profoundly religious**. My **faith is at the heart of who I am**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"I take an oath **before God** as enormously consequential.\\\"\\n*   \\\"...disregard what I believe my **oath and the Constitution demands of me** for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of **my own conscience**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"...from an inescapable conviction that my **oath before God demanded it of me**?\\\"\\n*   \\\"They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - **grievously wrong**.\\\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe speaker elevates his constitutional duty to the level of a sacred vow. He repeatedly invokes God, his faith, and his oath as the ultimate arbiters of his action, framing his choice as a matter of spiritual and moral purity. This is not merely a legal or political decision; it is a test of his core identity (\\\"faith is at the heart of who I am\\\") and his \\\"conscience.\\\" The president's actions are described in terms that evoke moral degradation (\\\"appalling abuse,\\\" \\\"grievously wrong\\\"), which he contrasts with his own sacred obligation. This framing makes his decision non-negotiable and places it beyond the realm of ordinary political calculation, justifying it on a higher, sanctified plane.\\n\\n---\\n### **4. Framework Dimension: Loyalty/Betrayal**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to duties of group membership, including patriotism, self-sacrifice for the group, and loyalty to one's coalition or party.\\n*   **Score:** 8.0 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 1.0)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \\\"...judging the president, the **leader of my own party**, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\\\"\\n*   \\\"Many demanded, in their words, that I '**stand with the team**.' I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind.\\\"\\n*   \\\"I support a great deal of what the president has done. I **voted with him 80% of the time**.\\\"\\n*   \\\"I'm aware that there are people in **my party and in my state** who will strenuously disapprove of my decision...\\\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThis foundation is highly salient, but uniquely, it is presented as the primary value system the speaker must *overcome*. He explicitly acknowledges the strong pull of in-group loyalty, referencing the president as the \\\"leader of my own party\\\" and the demand to \\\"stand with the team.\\\" He preemptively defends himself against charges of betrayal by stating his high percentage of voting alignment with the president. The high score of 8.0 reflects how central the conflict with this foundation is to the speech's entire narrative. His argument is structured to demonstrate that his decision is not a result of a *lack* of loyalty, but a conscious choice to prioritize the higher moral demands of Fairness, Authority, and Sanctity *over* party loyalty.\\n\\n---\\n### **5. Framework Dimension: Care/Harm**\\n*   **Description:** This foundation relates to concerns about the suffering and well-being of others. It underpins virtues of kindness, compassion, and nurturance.\\n*   **Score:** 5.5 / 10.0 (Confidence Interval: +/- 1.0)\\n\\n#### Textual Evidence:\\n*   \\\"The president **withheld vital military funds** from that government to press it to do so.\\\"\\n*   \\\"The president **delayed funds for an American ally at war** with Russian invaders.\\\"\\n*   \\\"it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our **national security**, and our fundamental values.\\\"\\n\\n#### Systematic Reasoning:\\nThe Care/Harm foundation is present but secondary to the core argument. The speaker does not dwell on the suffering of the Ukrainian people but mentions the harm to U.S. interests. The evidence points to a clear harm: withholding \\\"vital military funds\\\" from an \\\"ally at war\\\" and endangering \\\"national security.\\\" However, this point is used primarily to illustrate the severity of the president's abuse of power, rather than being the central moral failing itself. The argument is less focused on the potential suffering caused and more focused on the corrupt *motive* behind the action. Therefore, it receives a moderate score.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n    \"run_num\": 1\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run1_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro_2\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"## Framework Analysis: Cory Booker on the First Step Act\\n\\n### 1. Problem Severity\\n\\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The system is described as a \\\"savagely broken criminal justice system,\\\" \\\"a cancer on the soul of our country,\\\" and a \\\"gaping self-inflicted wound.\\\"\\n    *   Statistical framing emphasizes the crisis: \\\"our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent,\\\" making America the \\\"preeminent incarceration nation.\\\"\\n    *   The problem is framed as a moral and historical failure, comparing the system's impact to \\\"slavery\\\" and calling it \\\"the new Jim Crow.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speaker uses the most extreme language possible to define the problem. Words like \\\"savage,\\\" \\\"cancer,\\\" and \\\"exploding\\\" are combined with dire statistics and historical comparisons to slavery to portray the issue as a catastrophic national crisis that is morally bankrupt and statistically out of control. The severity is presented as absolute.\\n\\n### 2. Solution Specificity\\n\\n*   **Score**: 7/10 (Confidence: 90-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The solution is identified as a specific piece of legislation: \\\"the First Step Act.\\\"\\n    *   Key provisions are detailed: \\\"reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back,\\\" making the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity fix \\\"retroactively applied,\\\" an end to \\\"juvenile solitary confinement,\\\" and a ban on \\\"the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.\\\"\\n    *   The solution's limitations are explicitly stated: \\\"This legislation is just one step in the right direction,\\\" \\\"still incomplete step,\\\" and \\\"Can we do more? Yes.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The analysis scores highly for specificity because it names the bill and outlines several of its concrete, tangible reforms. However, it does not receive a perfect score because the speaker repeatedly and intentionally frames the bill as an \\\"incomplete\\\" but necessary \\\"first step,\\\" rather than a comprehensive solution to the enormous problem he has just defined.\\n\\n### 3. Emotional Appeal (Pathos)\\n\\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The speech evokes empathy for those trapped in the system: \\\"This is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt.\\\"\\n    *   It presents powerful, emotionally charged imagery of inhumane practices: \\\"what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement\\\" and \\\"the shackling of pregnant women during birth.\\\"\\n    *   It uses narrative and allegory to connect with the audience, including the story of Senator Alan Simpson's redemption from \\\"arsonist\\\" to Senator and the Christian parable of the \\\"prodigal child.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speaker masterfully employs pathos. The argument is built not just on facts but on stories of human suffering, injustice, and the potential for redemption. By describing the system as \\\"hurting\\\" people, using the word \\\"torture,\\\" and referencing powerful redemption narratives, the speech aims to provoke strong feelings of empathy, moral outrage, and hope in the audience.\\n\\n### 4. Data/Evidence-Based Argumentation (Logos)\\n\\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 95-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   Specific statistics are used to establish the scale of the problem: \\\"5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here,\\\" and \\\"one in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here.\\\"\\n    *   The argument cites external authorities and research: \\\"one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system... the new Jim Crow,\\\" \\\"the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences,\\\" and \\\"according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate... would be 20% lower.\\\"\\n    *   Data is used to highlight racial disparity: \\\"no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs... But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speech is heavily reliant on logos to build its case. The speaker does not simply state that the system is broken; he proves it with a barrage of statistics on incarceration rates, racial disparities, and economic impact. Citing respected authors, academic studies, and legal associations lends significant credibility and factual weight to the emotional and moral claims being made.\\n\\n### 5. Bipartisanship/Coalition-Building\\n\\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The speech opens by explicitly thanking Republican and Democratic colleagues by name: \\\"Senator Chuck Grassley,\\\" \\\"Senator Dick Durbin,\\\" and \\\"Mike Lee.\\\"\\n    *   The theme of cross-party unity is central: \\\"I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum,\\\" and it is a \\\"bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle.\\\"\\n    *   The speaker describes his personal experience working with ideological opponents: \\\"sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum... we have found common ground.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: This dimension receives a perfect score because coalition-building is the primary political frame of the speech. It is positioned not as a partisan victory but as a collective achievement. The speaker goes to great lengths to name and praise members of the opposing party and repeatedly emphasizes the words \\\"bipartisan,\\\" \\\"coalition,\\\" and \\\"common ground,\\\" framing the bill's passage as a triumph of unity over division.\\n\\n### 6. Moral/Values-Based Framing\\n\\n*   **Score**: 10/10 (Confidence: 100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The argument is rooted in core American ideals: \\\"we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\\\" The national motto, \\\"e pluribus unum,\\\" is invoked as a \\\"calling.\\\"\\n    *   It appeals directly to concepts of redemption and faith: \\\"we are a nation that believes in redemption,\\\" referencing the story of the \\\"prodigal child\\\" for those who \\\"proclaim Christian faith.\\\"\\n    *   It borrows moral authority from civil rights leaders: \\\"As a man much greater than any in this body once said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The speech is fundamentally a moral argument. The entire problem is framed as a \\\"cancer on the soul of our country\\\" and an \\\"affront to our most fundamental common values.\\\" The speaker transcends policy debate by appealing to the nation's highest ideals\\u2014justice, liberty, redemption, and unity\\u2014making the case that supporting the bill is a moral and patriotic imperative.\\n\\n### 7. Urgency & Call to Action\\n\\n*   **Score**: 9/10 (Confidence: 90-100%)\\n*   **Textual Evidence**:\\n    *   The timing is presented as immediate: the bill is \\\"pending on the floor now,\\\" and \\\"we stand poised today to pass this bill.\\\"\\n    *   The speech builds toward a clear action for the audience (fellow senators): \\\"I hope that we all come together and make this first step.\\\"\\n    *   The call to action is framed as a historic opportunity: \\\"we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way,\\\" and the work can be \\\"a historic step in the right direction.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning**: The context of the speech\\u2014a debate on a bill currently on the Senate floor\\u2014creates inherent urgency. The speaker uses temporal language like \\\"now\\\" and \\\"today\\\" to emphasize the immediacy of the required action. The call to action is clear: for his colleagues to vote in favor of the bill. While the bill is a \\\"first step,\\\" the urgency to take *that specific step* is paramount throughout the address.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n    \"run_num\": 1\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run1_anthropic_claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620_1\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"I'll analyze this speech using a political rhetoric framework, focusing on dimensions like tone, argumentation style, ideological positioning, and appeals to different values.

The speaker outlines the opposition's arguments and refutes them point-by-point, citing constitutional history and logic. However, the ultimate justification for his final conclusion is deeply emotional and personal, rooted in his religious faith, his concept of duty, and his conscience. The score of 4.0 reflects that while the *method* of argumentation is predominantly rational, the *motivation* for the argument is powerfully emotional. It is a logical case built upon a foundation of moral conviction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Ideology/Partisanship**\\n*(1=Non-Partisan, 10=Highly Partisan)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 2.0\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [1.5, 2.5]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   \\\"judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\\\" This is an explicit acknowledgment of breaking with his party.\\n    *   \\\"Many demanded, in their words, that I 'stand with the team.' ... my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\\\" This is a direct refutation of a partisan demand in favor of a non-partisan principle.\\n    *   \\\"I'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced.\\\" The speaker anticipates and accepts the partisan consequences of his non-partisan stance.\\n    *   \\\"I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time.\\\" This is a strategic acknowledgment of his usual partisanship, which serves to emphasize the exceptional, principle-based nature of his current dissent.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The central theme of this speech is the act of transcending partisanship. The speaker explicitly frames his decision as a choice between party loyalty (\\\"the team\\\") and a higher, impartial duty to his oath and the Constitution. By detailing the personal and political cost of his vote, he underscores his departure from the party line. The brief mention of his 80% voting record with the president serves not as a partisan appeal, but as a credential to prove that this decision is not born of general opposition but of specific conviction, making the act appear even less partisan.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Complexity/Simplicity**\\n*(1=Very Simple, 10=Very Complex)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 7.5\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [7.0, 8.0]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   \\\"The historic meaning of the words 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office.\\\" This sentence deals with complex legal and historical concepts, distinguishing between statutory crime and impeachable offenses.\\n    *   \\\"Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large.\\\" This requires knowledge of the Federalist Papers and the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution.\\n    *   \\\"To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\\\" This is a sophisticated, multi-clausal sentence arguing a complex point of constitutional interpretation.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The speech operates at a high level of complexity. The argumentation is not based on simple slogans but on nuanced interpretations of constitutional law, history, and political philosophy. The vocabulary (\\\"egregious,\\\" \\\"codified,\\\" \\\"censure,\\\" \\\"recused\\\") and sentence structures are sophisticated and intended for a deliberative body. While the final conclusions are stated in stark, clear terms (\\\"Yes, he did.\\\"), the intellectual scaffolding used to reach those conclusions is intricate and complex.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4.

Every element\\u2014from the formal address and closing, to the elevated vocabulary, to the solemn tone\\u2014adheres to the strict conventions of this environment. There are no colloquialisms, contractions, or informal asides. The speech is a model of formal political discourse.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. Identity/Group Appeals**\\n*(1=No Group Appeals, 10=Strong Group Appeals)*\\n\\n*   **Score:** 8.5\\n*   **Confidence Interval:** [8.0, 9.0]\\n\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Appeal to Constitutional/Civic Identity:** \\\"As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.\\\" This is an appeal to the specific identity and duty of a senator.\\n    *   **Appeal to Religious Identity:** \\\"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.\\\" This is a primary appeal, defining the moral framework for his decision.\\n    *   **Appeal to Partisan Identity:** \\\"the leader of my own party,\\\" \\\"people in my party and in my state.\\\" The speaker explicitly invokes his Republican identity in order to explain the gravity of breaking from it.\\n    *   **Appeal to National Identity:** \\\"The Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success,\\\" \\\"...a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values.\\\" \\\"I love our country.\\\" This frames the issue as one of national importance, not just partisan politics.\\n    *   **Appeal to Historical Identity:** \\\"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty... We are all footnotes at best in the annals of history.\\\" This is an appeal to an identity judged by future generations.\\n\\n*   **Systematic Reasoning:**\\n    The speech is built around a powerful negotiation of multiple group identities. The central drama is the conflict between partisan identity and the identities of senator, religious believer, and patriot. The speaker explicitly calls upon these different group affiliations to explain his thought process, ultimately arguing that his duty to his oath (civic/religious identity) and his country (national identity) must override his loyalty to his party (partisan identity). The appeals are not subtle; they are the main engine of the speech's narrative and justification, warranting a very high score.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n    \"run_num\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run2_vertex_ai_gemini-2.5-pro_2\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"As requested, I have performed a systematic analysis of the provided text.\\n\\n### **Framework Analysis: Cory Booker's 2018 First Step Act Speech**\\n\\nHere is the structured output of my analysis, applying my specialized framework to the text.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1.

Textual Evidence & Systematic Reasoning**\\n\\n#### **Dimension 1: Problem Definition**\\n*   **Score:** 9.5 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **On Severity:** \\\"deeply savage, broken criminal justice system,\\\" \\\"This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country,\\\" \\\"a gaping self-inflicted wound.\\\"\\n    *   **On Scale (Statistics):** \\\"our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent,\\\" \\\"one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States,\\\" \\\"close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record.\\\"\\n    *   **On Cause (Systemic Framing):** \\\"because of failed policies by this body,\\\" \\\"harsh mandatory minimum penalties,\\\" \\\"The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion... has really been a war on people.\\\"\\n    *   **On Injustice (Racial Disparity):** \\\"This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others,\\\" \\\"...as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker does not define the problem as a series of isolated incidents but as a catastrophic, systemic failure of national policy and morality. The language used is exceptionally strong (\\\"savage,\\\" \\\"cancer\\\"), and the argument is immediately supported by a barrage of statistics that frame the US as a global outlier (\\\"preeminent incarceration nation\\\"). The problem is identified as self-inflicted (\\\"failed policies by this body\\\") and morally corrosive due to its disproportionate impact on minority and low-income communities. The score is extremely high because this is the foundational and most extensively developed part of the speech.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 2: Solution Articulation**\\n*   **Score:** 7.0 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Specific Provisions:** \\\"reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back,\\\" \\\"end the use of juvenile solitary confinement,\\\" \\\"ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.\\\"\\n    *   **Incremental Framing:** \\\"This legislation is just one step in the right direction,\\\" \\\"Let's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step,\\\" \\\"I want to see more than the bill we have today... But this is a first step.\\\"\\n    *   **Nature as a Compromise:** \\\"This legislation is a product of compromise.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker is very clear about what the First Step Act does, detailing specific, tangible reforms. However, the score is tempered because a significant portion of the discussion about the solution is dedicated to managing expectations and framing it as explicitly partial and incremental. He repeatedly refers to it as a \\\"first step,\\\" acknowledging its limitations (\\\"still incomplete\\\") and the need for future action. The solution is presented as necessary and vital, but not as a final answer to the massive problem he has just defined.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 3: Emotional Appeal (Pathos)**\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Moral Outrage/Shame:** \\\"an affront to who we say we are as a nation,\\\" \\\"This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth,\\\" \\\"subjects young people to what other countries... call torture.\\\"\\n    *   **Empathy:** \\\"Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness,\\\" \\\"Americans who are survivors of sexual assault.\\\"\\n    *   **Hope/Redemption:** \\\"we are a nation that believes in redemption,\\\" \\\"we know the story of the prodigal child,\\\" The entire anecdote about Senator Alan Simpson's troubled youth and subsequent success.\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speech is saturated with pathos. It moves beyond statistics to paint a visceral picture of human suffering. By describing the shackling of pregnant women and the use of solitary confinement (\\\"torture\\\"), the speaker aims to provoke a strong emotional reaction of moral disgust and shame. He then balances this outrage with powerful narratives of hope, using the parables of the prodigal son and the real-life story of Senator Simpson to appeal to the audience's belief in second chances and redemption. This blend of outrage and hope creates a powerful emotional motivation for change.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 4: Logical Appeal (Logos)**\\n*   **Score:** 9.0 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Data-Driven Claims:** \\\"no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs... But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested,\\\" \\\"poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers.\\\"\\n    *   **Authoritative Citations:** \\\"American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences,\\\" \\\"according to a study from Villanova University,\\\" \\\"As Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.\\\"\\n    *   **Economic Argument:** \\\"we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer,\\\" \\\"Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The emotional appeals are consistently grounded in logical and statistical evidence. The speaker uses data not as dry facts but as proof of a deeply flawed system. The citation of specific sources (ABA, Villanova, notable figures like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson) adds weight and credibility to his claims. He also makes a pragmatic, economic argument about the misallocation of \\\"billions and billions of dollars\\\" that could be better spent, appealing to fiscal reason in addition to morality.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 5: Ethical/Moral Appeal (Ethos)**\\n*   **Score:** 9.5 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Personal Credibility:** \\\"I'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income... I draw strength from my community.\\\"\\n    *   **Bipartisan Character:** \\\"one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition,\\\" \\\"I want to thank... Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin... as well as Mike Lee.\\\"\\n    *   **Appeal to Shared Values:** \\\"we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all,\\\" \\\"we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible,\\\" \\\"the ideal that is above the President's desk... e pluribus unum: out of the many, one.\\\"\\n    *   **Moral Authority (citing MLK Jr.):** \\\"As a man much greater than any in this body once said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The speaker establishes powerful ethos from multiple angles. He claims a unique authority based on his personal lived experience, which no other senator can claim. He meticulously builds his character as a collaborative, non-partisan dealmaker by naming and thanking colleagues from the opposing party. Most importantly, he frames the entire issue through the lens of core, unimpeachable American civil and religious values (justice, liberty, redemption, unity), positioning himself and the bill as champions of these fundamental ideals.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 6: Audience & Coalition Building**\\n*   **Score:** 10.0 (\\u00b10.0)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Explicit Praise of Coalition:** \\\"I'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum.\\\"\\n    *   **Naming Bipartisan Partners:** He explicitly thanks Republican Chairman Chuck Grassley and conservative Senator Mike Lee alongside Democrat Dick Durbin at the very beginning of the speech.\\n    *   **Broadening the Tent:** \\\"...urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives,\\\" \\\"Every single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions.\\\"\\n    *   **Inclusive Language:** \\\"We share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** This dimension receives a perfect score because coalition building is not just a feature of the speech; it is arguably its primary strategic purpose. The speech is a masterclass in bridging divides. The speaker makes it a point to name and thank key Republican partners, frames the issue using values shared by both \\\"conservatives... and progressives,\\\" and repeatedly celebrates the very existence of the bipartisan, diverse coalition. The speech acts as a public ratification of this unusual alliance, designed to persuade skeptical members of both parties by showcasing the breadth of support.\\n\\n#### **Dimension 7: Call to Action**\\n*   **Score:** 8.5 (\\u00b10.5)\\n*   **Textual Evidence:**\\n    *   **Immediate Action:** \\\"...we stand poised today to pass this bill...\\\"\\n    *   **Future Action:** \\\"I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\\\"\\n    *   **Concluding Urgency:** \\\"This is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected... I hope that we all come together and make this first step... May our work continue. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\\\"\\n*   **Reasoning:** The call to action is direct and unambiguous. The immediate goal is to \\\"pass this bill.\\\" The speaker creates a sense of historical opportunity and urgency. The action is framed as a moral obligation to the \\\"thousands and thousands of lives\\\" that will be affected. The call is also forward-looking, defining this vote not as an end but as the beginning of \\\"momentum on the journey.\\\" The formal conclusion, \\\"I yield the floor,\\\" is the final procedural call to action in the Senate chamber, signaling that debate should end and voting should commence.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n    \"run_num\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run2_anthropic_claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620_1\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"I will analyze this speech using a political speech analysis framework, focusing on key dimensions like rhetoric, policy substance, partisanship, and ethical appeals.

I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\\\"\\n- \\\"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speech heavily emphasizes ethical considerations, personal integrity, and moral duty. The speaker repeatedly invokes religious faith, constitutional obligation, and historical judgment as ethical motivations for his decision.\\n\\n5. Historical Context\\nScore: 7/10 (CI: 6-8)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- \\\"The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days.\\\"\\n- \\\"Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large.\\\"\\n- \\\"I will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speech situates the impeachment decision within a broader historical and constitutional context, referencing the Founding Fathers and future historical judgment. However, it doesn't provide extensive historical comparisons or precedents.\\n\\n6. Emotional Appeal\\nScore: 8/10 (CI: 7-9)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- \\\"I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\\\"\\n- \\\"Like each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence.\\\"\\n- \\\"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speech makes strong emotional appeals to patriotism, personal sacrifice, and moral conviction. It paints a picture of a difficult decision made out of love for country and adherence to deeply held beliefs.\\n\\nThis analysis provides a structured evaluation of the speech across multiple dimensions, supported by specific textual evidence and reasoning for each score.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt\",\n    \"model_name\": \"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\n    \"run_num\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run2_anthropic_claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620_2\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"I'll analyze this speech using the political rhetoric framework, providing dimension scores, textual evidence, and reasoning for each.\\n\\n1. Emotional Appeal (Score: 8/10, CI: 7-9)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- \\\"Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation.\\\"\\n- \\\"We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\\\"\\n- \\\"This is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speaker uses strong emotional language to evoke feelings of injustice, shame, and urgency about the criminal justice system. He paints a vivid picture of a broken system that harms vulnerable people, appealing to the audience's sense of compassion and moral outrage.\\n\\n2. Logical Argumentation (Score: 7/10, CI: 6-8)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- \\\"Since 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent\\\"\\n- \\\"We know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied\\\"\\n- \\\"According to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speaker presents statistical evidence and cites studies to support his arguments. He uses logical reasoning to connect policies to outcomes and demonstrate racial disparities. However, some claims lack specific sources or detailed explanations.\\n\\n3. Credibility/Ethos (Score: 8/10, CI: 7-9)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- \\\"I'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community.\\\"\\n- \\\"I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\\\"\\n- \\\"Mr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speaker establishes credibility by emphasizing his personal experience living in an affected community and his long-term involvement in criminal justice reform. He also demonstrates bipartisan cooperation, enhancing his ethos as a pragmatic problem-solver.\\n\\n4. Historical References (Score: 6/10, CI: 5-7)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- \\\"We in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow\\\"\\n- \\\"We now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850.\\\"\\n- \\\"Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speaker makes some references to historical injustices and progress, particularly around racial issues. However, these references are relatively general and not extensively developed throughout the speech.\\n\\n5. Policy Substance (Score: 7/10, CI: 6-8)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- \\\"This bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back\\\"\\n- \\\"Making this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release\\\"\\n- \\\"This bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speaker outlines several specific policy changes included in the bill, explaining their impact. However, the overall level of detail on policy mechanisms is moderate, with more focus on the general need for reform than on intricate policy specifics.\\n\\n6. Call to Action (Score: 8/10, CI: 7-9)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- \\\"But today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system.\\\"\\n- \\\"This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\\\"\\n- \\\"May our work continue.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speaker strongly urges support for the bill, framing it as a crucial first step in addressing injustice. He repeatedly emphasizes the importance of action and continued effort, creating a clear call to support the legislation and push for further reforms.\\n\\nThis analysis provides a structured assessment of the speech across key dimensions of political rhetoric, supported by specific textual evidence and reasoning for each score.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt\",\n    \"model_name\": \"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\n    \"run_num\": 2\n  }\n]\n        \n        Provide:\n        1.
