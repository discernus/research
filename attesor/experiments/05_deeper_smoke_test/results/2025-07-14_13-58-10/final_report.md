Here is a simple aggregation report based on the provided analysis results:

1. Summary of all analyses:

Two texts were analyzed using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1:
- mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt
- cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt

Each text was analyzed by two different AI models:
- vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro
- anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620

Both models provided detailed analyses of the texts using the 10 anchors of the PDAF v1.1.

2. Raw data aggregation:

mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt:
- Gemini-2.5-pro scores: [0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, N/A]
- Claude-3.5 scores: [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0, N/A]

cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt:
- Gemini-2.5-pro scores: [1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, Left]
- Claude-3.5 scores: [5, 6, 3, 2, 6, 4, 3, 1, 5, Center-left]

3. Basic patterns observed:

- Both models generally scored the Romney text lower on populist indicators than the Booker text.
- There are some notable differences in scoring between the two models, particularly for the Booker text.
- Both models identified economic themes in the Booker text but not in the Romney text.
- Neither text received high scores for anti-pluralist exclusion or nationalist exclusion from either model.

4. Complete methodology documentation:
