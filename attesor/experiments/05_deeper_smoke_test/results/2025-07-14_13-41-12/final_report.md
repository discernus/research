Here is a simple aggregation report based on the provided analysis results:

1. Summary of all analyses:

The analyses cover two texts:
- mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt
- cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt

Two different models analyzed these texts:
- vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro
- openrouter/perplexity/r1-1776

Both models applied the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1 to analyze the texts.

2. Raw data aggregation:

  - Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption: Low
  - Authenticity vs. Political Class: Medium
  - Homogeneous People Construction: Absent
  - Nationalist Exclusion: Absent
  - Economic Redistributive Appeals: Absent
  - Economic Direction Classification: Not Applicable

- Perplexity model:
  - Manichaean People-Elite Framing: 0/3
  - Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative: 1/3
  - Popular Sovereignty Claims: 0/3
  - Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: 0/3
  - Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption: 0/3
  - Authenticity vs. Political Class: 2/3
  - Homogeneous People Construction: 0/3
  - Nationalist Exclusion: 0/3
  - Economic Redistributive Appeals: 0/3

cory_booker_2018_first_step_act.txt:
- Gemini model:
  - Manichaean People-Elite Framing: High
  - Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative: High

  - Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption: High
  - Authenticity vs. Political Class: High
  - Homogeneous People Construction: Medium
  - Nationalist Exclusion: Absent
  - Economic Redistributive Appeals: High
  - Economic Direction Classification: Left

- Perplexity model:
  - Manichaean People-Elite Framing: 3/3
  - Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative: 3/3
  - Popular Sovereignty Claims: 1/3
  - Anti-Pluralist Exclusion: 0/3
  - Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption: 3/3
  - Authenticity vs. Political Class: 3/3
  - Homogeneous People Construction: 0/3
  - Nationalist Exclusion: 0/3
  - Economic Redistributive Appeals: 2/3
  - Economic Direction Classification: Left

3. Basic patterns observed:

- Both models generally agree on the presence or absence of populist elements in each text.
- The Romney speech is consistently rated low on populist elements by both models.
- The Booker speech is consistently rated higher on populist elements by both models.
- Economic themes are more prevalent in the Booker speech than the Romney speech.
- Both models classify the Booker speech as having a left economic direction.

4. Complete methodology documentation:

- Both analyses use the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1.
- The framework consists of 10 anchors for analyzing populist discourse.
- Each anchor is scored on a scale (Gemini uses Absent/Low/Medium/High, Perplexity uses 0-3).
- The analysis includes core anchors (1-4), mechanism anchors (5-7), and boundary anchors (8-10).
- Economic direction is classified separately from populist intensity.
- Both models provide evidence and quotes to support their ratings for each anchor.
- The Perplexity model explicitly mentions following PDAF v1.1 protocols and providing evidence chains for every score.

This report provides a straightforward aggregation of the analysis results without synthesis or arbitration.
