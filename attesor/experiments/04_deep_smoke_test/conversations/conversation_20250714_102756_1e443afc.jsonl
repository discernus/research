Dataset description and methodology: The methodology is described in sufficient detail, including the models to be used, the number of runs, and the data processing approach (raw aggregation without adversarial synthesis).\\n\\n4. Analysis plan: The analysis plan is outlined, including the specific success criteria (YAML generation, orchestrator execution, statistical analysis, provenance, and THIN compliance).\\n\\n5. Literature context and justification: While not explicitly stated, the experiment appears to be well-grounded in the context of the THIN software + THICK intelligence pipeline, which is a relevant and established framework.\\n\\nThe only minor issue is the lack of explicit literature context and justification, but given the details provided, this experiment design is comprehensive and should be able to effectively validate the end-to-end THIN pipeline.\",\n    \"message\": \"Experiment passed validation (95% completeness)\"\n  },\n  \"corpus_result\": {\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"validation_passed\": true,\n    \"corpus_path\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/04_deep_smoke_test/corpus\",\n    \"file_count\": 2,\n    \"has_manifest\": false,\n    \"manifest_files\": [],\n    \"message\": \"Corpus validation passed (2 files found)\"\n  },\n  \"statistical_plan\": {\n    \"required_tests\": [\n      {\n        \"test_name\": \"raw_aggregation\",\n        \"scope\": \"bias_isolation\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"test_name\": \"inter_model_comparison\",\n        \"scope\": \"model_performance_comparison\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"test_name\": \"inter_run_reliability\",\n        \"scope\": \"result_reliability\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"validation_status\": \"complete\",\n    \"notes\": null\n  },\n  \"ready_for_execution\": true\n}\n        \n        Questions:\n        1.
