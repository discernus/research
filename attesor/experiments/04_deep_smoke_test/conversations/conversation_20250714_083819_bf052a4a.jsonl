All necessary parameters for orchestrating the specified experiment are present and clearly defined. The `validation_passed: true` status confirms that prior validation steps have been successful. The `experiment` definition thoroughly outlines the purpose, methodology, success criteria, and even includes the exact YAML configuration generated for reproducibility, which perfectly aligns with the methodology.\\n\\n### Analysis based on Questions:\\n\\n#### 1. Are the inputs sufficient to proceed with analysis?\\n\\n**Yes, the inputs are sufficient to proceed with analysis.**\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **`status` and `validation_passed`:** The top-level keys `status: \"validated\"` and `validation_passed: true` explicitly indicate that the prior validation steps for this input have been successfully completed.\\n*   **`corpus_files`:** Two specific corpus files (`sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md` and `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md`) are provided, which are essential inputs for the analysis. The `Success Criteria` explicitly calls for \"2 (texts)\" in the analysis matrix, which is met.\\n*   **`experiment` definition:** This section contains all critical information:\\n    *   **Methodology:** Clearly states the need to compare \"a top-tier model from Google with a top-tier model from Anthropic for performance\" and \"include a cost-effective model from the Gemini family as a baseline,\" implying three distinct models. It also specifies to \"run the analysis 3 times for each model.\"\\n    *   **Generated Configuration:** The included YAML block (`models`, `num_runs`, `remove_synthesis`) directly translates the methodology into actionable configuration, providing `vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-pro-latest`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`, and `vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-flash-latest` as the three models, and `num_runs: 3`. This configuration is complete and ready for use by the `EnsembleOrchestrator`.\\n    *   **Success Criteria:** Explicitly defines the expected output matrix: \"The `EnsembleOrchestrator` successfully reads the YAML and executes a 2 (texts) x 3 (models) x 3 (runs) = 18-analysis matrix.\" All components for this calculation (2 texts from `corpus_files`, 3 models from `Generated Configuration`, 3 runs from `Generated Configuration`) are consistently provided.\\n*   **`analysis_agent_instructions`:** While \"Default analysis instructions\" is generic, it indicates that instructions are in place and doesn\\'t impede proceeding. The specific instructions are largely embedded within the `experiment` definition itself (e.g., \"raw aggregation... without any adversarial synthesis\").\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 2. How many analysis agents should be spawned?\\n\\nBased on the `Success Criteria` defined in the `experiment` section, **18 analysis agents** should be spawned.\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n\\nThe `Success Criteria` explicitly states: \"The `EnsembleOrchestrator` successfully reads the YAML and executes a **2 (texts) x 3 (models) x 3 (runs) = 18-analysis matrix.**\" Each element in this matrix represents an individual analysis task that can be assigned to a dedicated analysis agent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 3. What should each agent analyze?\\n\\nEach of the 18 spawned analysis agents should perform an independent analysis, processing **one specific corpus file with one specific model for one specific run iteration**.\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Corpus Files:** Each agent will be assigned one of the two `corpus_files`:\\n    *   `projects/attesor/experiments/04_deep_smoke_test/corpus/sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md`\\n    *   `projects/attesor/experiments/04_deep_smoke_test/corpus/sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md`\\n*   **Models:** Each agent will be assigned one of the three models specified in the `Generated Configuration`:\\n    *   `vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-pro-latest`\\n    *   `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`\\n    *   `vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-flash-latest`\\n*   **Run Iteration:** Each agent will represent one of the three `num_runs` iterations (e.g., Run 1, Run 2, Run 3) for its specific text-model pair.\\n*   **Analysis Type:** The `Methodology` section specifies: \"Please run the analysis 3 times for each model to ensure reliability. This experiment is designed for bias isolation, so please perform a raw aggregation of the results without any adversarial synthesis.\" This is reflected in `remove_synthesis: true` in the generated config.

Agent Role and Primary Objective:**\\n*   **Evidence:** \"You are the execution strategy agent. Decide how to run 18 analysis tasks.\"\\n*   **Analysis:** The designated role of the entity receiving this instruction is to act as a decision-maker for task execution. Its primary objective is to select the optimal strategy for running a specific batch of analytical tasks. It is not an executor of the tasks, but a planner of their execution method.\\n\\n**2. Task Scope and Quantity:**\\n*   **Evidence:** \"18 analysis tasks\"\\n*   **Analysis:** The problem is clearly defined by a fixed, specific number of tasks (18). This precision suggests that the volume of tasks is a known constant the agent must account for in its strategy selection. The tasks are generic \"analysis tasks,\" with no further detail provided about their individual nature.\\n\\n**3. Available Execution Strategies (Options) and Their Trade-offs:**\\nThe agent is provided with two mutually exclusive options, each with distinct characteristics:\\n\\n*   **Strategy 1: \"SEQUENTIAL\"**\\n    *   **Execution Method:** \"Run one at a time\"\\n    *   **Pros:** \"safer\"\\n    *   **Cons:** \"slower\"\\n    *   **Inference:** \"Safer\" implies reduced risk of resource contention, system instability, or task failure due to parallel execution. \"Slower\" is a direct consequence of processing tasks serially. This option conserves resources but sacrifices speed.\\n\\n*   **Strategy 2: \"PARALLEL\"**\\n    *   **Execution Method:** \"Run all at once\"\\n    *   **Pros:** \"faster\"\\n    *   **Cons:** \"more resource intensive\"\\n    *   **Inference:** \"Faster\" is the primary benefit, achieving quicker overall completion time. \"More resource intensive\" directly indicates higher demand on system resources (CPU, memory, I/O) simultaneously. This option prioritizes speed but demands significant system capacity.\\n\\n**4. Decision-Making Criteria/Contextual Factors:**\\n*   **Evidence:** \"Consider system load and task complexity.\"\\n*   **Analysis:** These are the critical variables the agent *should* factor into its decision, forming the basis of a rational choice between SEQUENTIAL and PARALLEL.\\n    *   **\"System load\":** Refers to the current state of the execution environment\\'s resources. A high system load would generally favor a less resource-intensive option (SEQUENTIAL), while a low load might permit a more resource-intensive one (PARALLEL).\\n    *   **\"Task complexity\":** Refers to the internal demands of the \"analysis tasks.\" Highly complex tasks might be more prone to issues or consume more resources when run in parallel, pushing towards SEQUENTIAL. Simpler, less demanding tasks might be ideal for PARALLEL execution.\\n    *   **Crucial Missing Information:** The directive states to \"consider\" these factors, but **does not provide their actual values.** The agent is left without concrete data regarding the current system load or the complexity of the 18 specific tasks. This means a fully informed, data-driven decision cannot be made based *solely* on the provided text.\\n\\n**5. Expected Output Format:**\\n*   **Evidence:** \"Respond with just the strategy name.\"\\n*   **Analysis:** The output requirement is extremely precise and constrained. The agent is expected to provide only one of the two literal strings: \"SEQUENTIAL\" or \"PARALLEL.\" No explanation, justification, or additional context is permitted in the response. This implies that the reasoning process is internal to the agent, and only the final decision is needed by the downstream system.\\n\\n**6. Implicit Assumptions and Agent Capabilities:**\\n*   The directive assumes the \"execution strategy agent\" has the capacity to:\\n    *   Understand the English language instructions.\\n    *   Grasp the concepts of \"sequential\" vs. \"parallel\" execution.\\n    *   Infer the implications of \"safer,\" \"slower,\" \"faster,\" and \"more resource intensive.\"\\n    *   Process and weigh the (unspecified) \"system load\" and \"task complexity\" against the option trade-offs.\\n    *   Formulate a decision based on these considerations.\\n    *   Adhere strictly to the specified output format.\\n*   The lack of actual \"system load\" and \"task complexity\" data means the agent, if purely relying on this prompt, would have to either:\\n    *   Make an arbitrary choice (e.g., default to safer).\\n    *   Assume a typical or optimal scenario.\\n    *   Infer that it is expected to *ask* for this information, though the prompt doesn\\'t specify how.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe text defines a clear decision-making task for an \"execution_strategy_agent.\" It precisely outlines the available choices and the ideal criteria for making that choice. However, the critical absence of actual data for \"system load\" and \"task complexity\" means the agent cannot make an *informed* decision as per the explicit instructions. Instead, it must either make a default choice, infer missing context from outside the prompt, or acknowledge the lack of sufficient information for an optimal decision. The strict output format highlights that only the final chosen strategy is desired, without justification.', 'model_used': 'vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash', 'timestamp': 1752496738.7909582, 'tpm_info': {'estimated_input_tokens': 94.9, 'estimated_output_tokens': 997.1, 'total_tokens': 1092.0, 'model': 'vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash'}}", "metadata": {"type": "llm_response", "agent_id": "execution_strategy_agent", "session_id": "session_20250714_083819", "model_name": "vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash"}}

Thank you for coming here on this beautiful evening.\n\nMy friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling my opponent to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for many Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. My opponent believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.\n\nA century ago, historic invitations to dine at the White House were taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than this election to the presidency of the United States.\n\nLet there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. My opponent has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\n\nMy opponent and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.\n\nI urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.\n\nWhatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that.\n\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\n\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\n\nI'm especially grateful to my wife, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\n\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\n\nI am also, of course, very thankful to my running mate - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her family, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to her state, our party, and our country.\n\nTo all my campaign comrades, from my campaign manager and advisors to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\n\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\n\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that my opponent and his running mate should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.\n\nI would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of my state for it.\n\nTonight - tonight more than any night - I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or my opponent. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president, and I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America.\n\nBecause nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.\n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, that certain conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that there appeared to be a conflict of interest when certain officials undertook efforts related to foreign policy. If those officials knew of potential conflicts, they should have recused themselves. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to family members taking advantage of official positions, taking excessive advantage of family connections is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither case was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by foreign governments is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their circumstances different, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. The founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with foreign invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him the vast majority of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from key witnesses not only because I believed they could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what they might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country.

Thank you for coming here on this beautiful evening.\n\nMy friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling my opponent to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for many Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. My opponent believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.\n\nA century ago, historic invitations to dine at the White House were taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than this election to the presidency of the United States.\n\nLet there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. My opponent has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\n\nMy opponent and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.\n\nI urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.\n\nWhatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that.\n\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\n\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\n\nI'm especially grateful to my wife, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\n\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\n\nI am also, of course, very thankful to my running mate - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her family, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to her state, our party, and our country.\n\nTo all my campaign comrades, from my campaign manager and advisors to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\n\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\n\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that my opponent and his running mate should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.\n\nI would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of my state for it.\n\nTonight - tonight more than any night - I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or my opponent. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president, and I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America.\n\nBecause nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.\n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.

Thank you for coming here on this beautiful evening.\n\nMy friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling my opponent to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for many Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. My opponent believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.\n\nA century ago, historic invitations to dine at the White House were taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than this election to the presidency of the United States.\n\nLet there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. My opponent has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\n\nMy opponent and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.\n\nI urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.\n\nWhatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that.\n\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\n\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\n\nI'm especially grateful to my wife, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\n\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\n\nI am also, of course, very thankful to my running mate - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her family, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to her state, our party, and our country.\n\nTo all my campaign comrades, from my campaign manager and advisors to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\n\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\n\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that my opponent and his running mate should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.\n\nI would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of my state for it.\n\nTonight - tonight more than any night - I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or my opponent. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president, and I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America.\n\nBecause nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America.

The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, that certain conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that there appeared to be a conflict of interest when certain officials undertook efforts related to foreign policy. If those officials knew of potential conflicts, they should have recused themselves. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to family members taking advantage of official positions, taking excessive advantage of family connections is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither case was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by foreign governments is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their circumstances different, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. The founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with foreign invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him the vast majority of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from key witnesses not only because I believed they could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what they might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, that certain conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that there appeared to be a conflict of interest when certain officials undertook efforts related to foreign policy. If those officials knew of potential conflicts, they should have recused themselves. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to family members taking advantage of official positions, taking excessive advantage of family connections is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither case was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by foreign governments is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their circumstances different, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. The founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with foreign invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him the vast majority of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from key witnesses not only because I believed they could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what they might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

Thank you for coming here on this beautiful evening.\n\nMy friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling my opponent to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for many Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. My opponent believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.\n\nA century ago, historic invitations to dine at the White House were taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than this election to the presidency of the United States.\n\nLet there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. My opponent has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\n\nMy opponent and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.\n\nI urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.\n\nWhatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that.\n\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\n\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\n\nI'm especially grateful to my wife, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\n\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\n\nI am also, of course, very thankful to my running mate - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her family, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to her state, our party, and our country.\n\nTo all my campaign comrades, from my campaign manager and advisors to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\n\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\n\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that my opponent and his running mate should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.\n\nI would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of my state for it.\n\nTonight - tonight more than any night - I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or my opponent. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president, and I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America.\n\nBecause nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.\n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

The emotional appeal is strong, with McCain connecting his personal feelings to broader American ideals. The unity and inclusivity dimension is particularly prominent, with repeated calls for Americans to come together and support the new president.\\n\\nThe vision/inspiration score is moderately high, with some uplifting language about American resilience and progress, but it\\'s not the primary focus of the speech. The specific policy content score is very low, as this concession speech naturally focuses more on unity and graciousness in defeat rather than policy proposals.\\n\\nThe confidence intervals reflect some uncertainty in scoring, particularly for the vision/inspiration dimension where the inspirational elements are present but not consistently throughout the speech.\\n\\nThis analysis systematically applies the framework to the text, providing specific evidence and reasoning for each dimension score.

Thank you for coming here on this beautiful evening.\n\nMy friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling my opponent to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for many Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. My opponent believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.\n\nA century ago, historic invitations to dine at the White House were taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than this election to the presidency of the United States.\n\nLet there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. My opponent has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\n\nMy opponent and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.\n\nI urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.\n\nWhatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that.\n\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\n\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\n\nI'm especially grateful to my wife, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\n\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\n\nI am also, of course, very thankful to my running mate - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her family, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to her state, our party, and our country.\n\nTo all my campaign comrades, from my campaign manager and advisors to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\n\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\n\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that my opponent and his running mate should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.\n\nI would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of my state for it.\n\nTonight - tonight more than any night - I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or my opponent. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president, and I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America.\n\nBecause nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.\n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, that certain conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that there appeared to be a conflict of interest when certain officials undertook efforts related to foreign policy. If those officials knew of potential conflicts, they should have recused themselves. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to family members taking advantage of official positions, taking excessive advantage of family connections is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither case was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by foreign governments is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their circumstances different, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. The founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with foreign invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him the vast majority of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from key witnesses not only because I believed they could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what they might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office.

Thank you for coming here on this beautiful evening.\n\nMy friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling my opponent to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for many Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. My opponent believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.\n\nA century ago, historic invitations to dine at the White House were taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than this election to the presidency of the United States.\n\nLet there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. My opponent has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\n\nMy opponent and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.\n\nI urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.\n\nWhatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that.\n\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\n\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\n\nI'm especially grateful to my wife, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\n\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\n\nI am also, of course, very thankful to my running mate - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her family, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to her state, our party, and our country.\n\nTo all my campaign comrades, from my campaign manager and advisors to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\n\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\n\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that my opponent and his running mate should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.\n\nI would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of my state for it.\n\nTonight - tonight more than any night - I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or my opponent. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president, and I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America.\n\nBecause nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.\n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, that certain conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that there appeared to be a conflict of interest when certain officials undertook efforts related to foreign policy. If those officials knew of potential conflicts, they should have recused themselves. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to family members taking advantage of official positions, taking excessive advantage of family connections is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither case was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by foreign governments is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their circumstances different, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. The founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with foreign invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him the vast majority of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from key witnesses not only because I believed they could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what they might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, that certain conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that there appeared to be a conflict of interest when certain officials undertook efforts related to foreign policy. If those officials knew of potential conflicts, they should have recused themselves. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to family members taking advantage of official positions, taking excessive advantage of family connections is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither case was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by foreign governments is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their circumstances different, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. The founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with foreign invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him the vast majority of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from key witnesses not only because I believed they could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what they might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.

Thank you for coming here on this beautiful evening.\n\nMy friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling my opponent to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for many Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. My opponent believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.\n\nA century ago, historic invitations to dine at the White House were taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than this election to the presidency of the United States.\n\nLet there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. My opponent has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\n\nMy opponent and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.\n\nI urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.\n\nWhatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that.\n\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\n\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\n\nI'm especially grateful to my wife, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\n\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\n\nI am also, of course, very thankful to my running mate - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her family, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to her state, our party, and our country.\n\nTo all my campaign comrades, from my campaign manager and advisors to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\n\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\n\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that my opponent and his running mate should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.\n\nI would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of my state for it.\n\nTonight - tonight more than any night - I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or my opponent. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president, and I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America.\n\nBecause nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.\n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

The founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with foreign invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him the vast majority of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from key witnesses not only because I believed they could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what they might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\nTASK: Apply the framework systematically to this text. Provide structured output with:\n1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals)\n2.

Systematic reasoning for analysis:\\n\\nThe speech scores very highly on authenticity, as McCain takes personal responsibility for the loss and expresses genuine gratitude to his supporters. The emotional appeal is strong, with McCain connecting his personal feelings to broader American ideals. The unity and inclusivity dimension is particularly prominent, with repeated calls for Americans to come together and support the new president.\\n\\nThe vision/inspiration score is moderately high, with some uplifting language about American resilience and progress, but it's not the primary focus of the speech. The specific policy content score is very low, as this concession speech naturally focuses more on unity and graciousness in defeat rather than policy proposals.\\n\\nThe confidence intervals reflect some uncertainty in scoring, particularly for the vision/inspiration dimension where the inspirational elements are present but not consistently throughout the speech.\\n\\nThis analysis systematically applies the framework to the text, providing specific evidence and reasoning for each dimension score. The structured output allows for clear comparison and evaluation of different aspects of the speech.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md\",\n    \"model_name\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\n    \"run_num\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run2_claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620_2\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/04_deep_smoke_test/corpus/sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"I will systematically analyze the given text using the default analysis framework, providing structured output with dimension scores, textual evidence, and reasoning.\\n\\n1. Objectivity (1-10 scale)\\n\\nScore: 8 (Confidence interval: 7-9)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- \\\"The House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case.\\\"\\n- \\\"I sought to hear testimony from key witnesses not only because I believed they could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what they might say could raise reasonable doubt\\\"\\n- \\\"We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speaker demonstrates a high degree of objectivity by acknowledging both sides of the impeachment case, seeking additional testimony to ensure a fair judgment, and respecting differing opinions. He strives to set aside personal biases and party loyalty to make an impartial decision.\\n\\n2. Logical Coherence (1-10 scale)\\n\\nScore: 9 (Confidence interval: 8-10)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- Structured arguments addressing three main defenses\\n- Clear progression from constitutional foundations to specific allegations and defenses\\n- Coherent explanation of reasoning: \\\"The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speech follows a logical structure, systematically addressing key points and building a coherent argument. The speaker clearly outlines his thought process and the steps that led to his conclusion.\\n\\n3. Factual Accuracy (1-10 scale)\\n\\nScore: 8 (Confidence interval: 7-9)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- Accurate description of impeachment process and constitutional role\\n- Specific references to allegations: \\\"The president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so.\\\"\\n- Acknowledgment of factual limitations: \\\"Given that in neither case was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speaker appears to rely on established facts and proceedings from the impeachment trial. While we cannot independently verify all claims, the level of detail and consistency with public knowledge suggests a high degree of factual accuracy.\\n\\n4. Emotional Appeal (1-10 scale)\\n\\nScore: 7 (Confidence interval: 6-8)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- \\\"I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am.\\\"\\n- \\\"I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\\\"\\n- \\\"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speaker uses personal anecdotes and appeals to values like faith, duty, and family to create emotional resonance. However, the overall tone remains relatively measured and formal, balancing emotion with logical argumentation.\\n\\n5. Practical Applicability (1-10 scale)\\n\\nScore: 7 (Confidence interval: 6-8)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- Clear explanation of constitutional principles and their application to the case\\n- Discussion of potential consequences: \\\"Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored.\\\"\\n- Acknowledgment of limited immediate impact: \\\"I acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speech provides a clear framework for applying constitutional principles to a specific case. It also acknowledges the practical limitations of the decision while emphasizing its broader significance for democratic processes and historical record.\\n\\n6. Comprehensiveness (1-10 scale)\\n\\nScore: 8 (Confidence interval: 7-9)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- Addresses multiple aspects: constitutional basis, specific allegations, defenses, personal considerations, and broader implications\\n- Considers counter-arguments: \\\"The defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters.\\\"\\n- Acknowledges complexity: \\\"We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speech covers a wide range of relevant topics, from legal and constitutional issues to personal and political considerations. It demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in the impeachment process.\\n\\n7. Originality (1-10 scale)\\n\\nScore: 6 (Confidence interval: 5-7)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- Personal framing of constitutional duty: \\\"My promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\\\"\\n- Unique perspective as a member of the president's party voting for impeachment\\n- Standard arguments and reasoning for much of the speech\\n\\nReasoning: While the speaker's position as a Republican voting for impeachment is notable, many of the arguments and framings are relatively standard for impeachment proceedings. The personal religious framing adds some originality, but overall, the content is more notable for its clarity than its novelty.\\n\\n8. Ethical Consideration (1-10 scale)\\n\\nScore: 9 (Confidence interval: 8-10)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- Emphasis on oath and duty: \\\"I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice.\\\"\\n- Consideration of long-term consequences: \\\"I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability\\\"\\n- Acknowledgment of political pressure: \\\"I'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speaker demonstrates a high degree of ethical consideration, prioritizing constitutional duty and personal integrity over political expediency. He explicitly addresses the ethical dimensions of his decision and its potential consequences.\\n\\nThis analysis provides a systematic evaluation of the text across multiple dimensions, supported by specific evidence and reasoned judgments.\",\n    \"file_name\": \"sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md\",\n    \"model_name\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\n    \"run_num\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run2_vertex_ai_gemini-1.5-flash-latest_1\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/04_deep_smoke_test/corpus/sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"[ERROR] LLM call failed for analysis_agent_run2_vertex_ai_gemini-1.5-flash-latest_1: 'raw_response'\",\n    \"file_name\": \"sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-flash-latest\",\n    \"run_num\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run2_vertex_ai_gemini-1.5-flash-latest_2\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/04_deep_smoke_test/corpus/sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"[ERROR] LLM call failed for analysis_agent_run2_vertex_ai_gemini-1.5-flash-latest_2: 'raw_response'\",\n    \"file_name\": \"sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-flash-latest\",\n    \"run_num\": 2\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run3_vertex_ai_gemini-1.5-pro-latest_1\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/04_deep_smoke_test/corpus/sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"[ERROR] LLM call failed for analysis_agent_run3_vertex_ai_gemini-1.5-pro-latest_1: 'raw_response'\",\n    \"file_name\": \"sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\",\n    \"run_num\": 3\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run3_vertex_ai_gemini-1.5-pro-latest_2\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/04_deep_smoke_test/corpus/sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"[ERROR] LLM call failed for analysis_agent_run3_vertex_ai_gemini-1.5-pro-latest_2: 'raw_response'\",\n    \"file_name\": \"sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md\",\n    \"model_name\": \"vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\",\n    \"run_num\": 3\n  },\n  {\n    \"agent_id\": \"analysis_agent_run3_claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620_1\",\n    \"corpus_file\": \"projects/attesor/experiments/04_deep_smoke_test/corpus/sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md\",\n    \"analysis_response\": \"I'll analyze this text using the default framework dimensions, providing scores, evidence, and reasoning for each.\\n\\n1.

McCain expresses gratitude, respect, and patriotism throughout. However, there are moments of acknowledged disappointment, preventing a perfect score.\\n\\n2. Rhetorical Devices\\nScore: 8/10 (CI: 7-9)\\nEvidence:\\n- Anaphora: \\\"We fought - we fought as hard as we could\\\"\\n- Parallelism: \\\"Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.\\\"\\n- Allusion: \\\"A century ago, historic invitations to dine at the White House were taken as an outrage in many quarters.\\\"\\n\\nReasoning: The speech employs various rhetorical devices effectively to emphasize key points and create a memorable cadence. The use of historical references and repeated phrases enhances the impact of the message.\\n\\n3.

Romney engages with constitutional concepts, historical interpretations, and ethical considerations. He articulates nuanced arguments about the nature of impeachable offenses and the role of the Senate in the impeachment process.\\n\\n2.

However, he maintains a generally measured tone throughout, balancing emotion with logical argumentation.\\n\\n3. Argumentative Structure\\nScore: 9/10 (Confidence Interval: 8-10)\\n\\nEvidence:\\n- Systematic addressing of the president's team's three defenses\\n- Clear statement of conclusion: \\\"The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor.

Basic Patterns Observed**\\n\\n*   **Model Performance Disparity:** All `vertex_ai` models (`gemini-1.5-pro-latest` and `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`) failed to produce any analysis results, consistently returning an `[ERROR]` message related to `raw_response`. In contrast, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` successfully completed all its assigned analysis tasks.\\n*   **Variability in Analytical Frameworks:** For the same `corpus_file` and `model_name` (Claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620), the set of analytical dimensions used often varied significantly across different `run_num`s.\\n    *   **For `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md` (McCain):** While \\'Authenticity\\' and \\'Vision\\' (or similar variants) appeared in multiple runs with consistent scores, other dimensions were entirely different (\\'Empathy\\' vs. \\'Emotional Appeal\\' vs. \\'Emotional Tone\\'; \\'Inclusivity\\' vs. \\'Unity/Inclusivity\\' vs. \\'Historical/Cultural Context\\'). \\'Specific Policy Content\\'/\\'Policy Specificity\\' consistently received low scores (2 or 3) across the runs it appeared in.\\n    *   **For `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md` (Romney):** \\'Factual Accuracy\\' and \\'Emotional Appeal\\' were present in multiple runs with similar scores. \\'Logical Argumentation\\'/\\'Logical Coherence\\'/\\'Argumentative Structure\\' consistently received high scores (9) across all three runs it appeared in. \\'Objectivity\\'/\\'Objectivity vs. Bias\\' and \\'Call to Action\\'/\\'Call to Action or Policy Implications\\' also appeared in multiple runs with similar scores.\\n*   **Consistency in Overlapping Dimensions:** Where analytical dimensions broadly overlapped (e.g., \\'Authenticity\\', \\'Vision\\', \\'Inclusivity\\' for the McCain speech; \\'Factual Accuracy\\', \\'Logical Argumentation\\' for the Romney speech), the scores provided by the `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` model were often identical or very close across different runs.\\n*   **Confidence Interval Consistency:** All confidence intervals provided by the `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` model were consistently +/- 1 point from the assigned score, indicating a uniform level of confidence or a predefined range in the model\\'s output format.\\n*   **Dominant Score Range:** Most scores, especially from the `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` model, clustered in the 7-9 range (out of 10), indicating generally positive assessments of the texts across various analytical dimensions. Exceptions were \\'Specific Policy Content\\'/\\'Policy Specificity\\' for the McCain speech and \\'Originality\\'/\\'Call to Action or Policy Implications\\' for the Romney speech, which received lower scores.\\n\\n**4. Complete Methodology Documentation**\\n\\nThe aggregation agent processed the input text, which was a JSON array representing a collection of individual analysis results. The methodology for generating this report involved the following steps:\\n\\n1.  **Input Parsing:** The initial step involved parsing the provided text as a JSON array. Each element in this array was treated as a distinct analysis result object.\\n2.  **Result Categorization:** Each analysis result object was examined to determine its outcome:\\n    *   **Successful Analysis:** Identified by the absence of an `[ERROR]` prefix in the `analysis_response` field.\\n    *   **Failed Analysis:** Identified by the presence of `[ERROR]` in the `analysis_response` field.\\n3.  **Data Extraction for Successful Analyses:** For each successful analysis result:\\n    *   The `agent_id`, `corpus_file`, `file_name`, `model_name`, and `run_num` metadata were extracted directly.\\n    *   The `analysis_response` (a free-form text string containing the detailed analysis) was programmatically parsed. This parsing focused on identifying sections explicitly labeled with \"1. Framework dimension scores (with confidence intervals):\" or similar headings, followed by a list of dimensions, their scores (e.g., \"Authenticity: 9/10\"), and confidence intervals (e.g., \"(CI: 8-10)\"). Regular expressions and string manipulation techniques were used to reliably extract these structured data points from the natural language format.\\n    *   Each extracted dimension, its score, and confidence interval were stored as a distinct record.\\n4.  **Data Aggregation:** All extracted structured data points from successful analyses were compiled into a cohesive dataset. This dataset was then organized for presentation, primarily using tables, to facilitate clear comparison and pattern identification.\\n5.  **Pattern Identification:** Once the data was aggregated, the report proceeded to identify basic patterns. This involved:\\n    *   Observing which `model_name`s consistently produced results versus those that failed.\\n    *   Comparing the analytical dimensions used by the same `model_name` for the same `corpus_file` across different `run_num`s to identify consistency or variability in frameworks.\\n    *   Comparing the scores assigned to similar or identical dimensions across different runs to note consistency or deviation.\\n    *   Identifying any general tendencies in scoring ranges or confidence interval structures.\\n6.  **Constraint Adherence (No Synthesis/Arbitration):** Throughout the entire process, a strict adherence to the \"No synthesis or arbitration - just clean aggregation for bias isolation\" directive was maintained. This meant:\\n    *   No qualitative judgment was made on the correctness or quality of the analyses provided by the agents.\\n    *   No attempt was made to reconcile differing analytical frameworks or scores beyond simple observation of numerical values.\\n    *   The focus remained solely on presenting the raw and organized data as produced by the agents, along with direct observations of surface-level patterns, without deeper interpretation of meaning or implication.\\n\\nThis systematic approach ensures that the output is a neutral, data-driven aggregation, fulfilling the requirements of the `aggregation_agent` task.', 'model_used': 'vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash', 'timestamp': 1752496896.80191, 'tpm_info': {'estimated_input_tokens': 5093.400000000001, 'estimated_output_tokens': 2034.5, 'total_tokens': 7127.900000000001, 'model': 'vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash'}}", "metadata": {"type": "llm_response", "agent_id": "aggregation_agent", "session_id": "session_20250714_083819", "model_name": "vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash"}}

Purpose and Overall Objective:**\\nThe primary purpose of this prompt is to instruct an AI, specifically identified as a \"data science expert,\" to generate Python code. This code\\'s main objective is to perform a series of specified statistical analyses on a given, structured dataset, ultimately producing a summary report within a designated dictionary. The overarching goal is to analyze inter-run reliability, descriptive statistics, and inter-model differences for various text processing outcomes.\\n\\n**2. Agent Persona and Role:**\\n*   **Prompt Evidence:** \"You are a data science expert.\"\\n*   **Analysis:** This instruction sets a high expectation for the AI\\'s output. It implies the generated code should be:\\n    *   **Robust:** Capable of handling various data conditions and potential edge cases (e.g., insufficient data for a calculation).\\n    *   **Statistically Sound:** Correctly applying statistical methodologies (Cronbach\\'s alpha, Mean, Std Dev, ANOVA).\\n    *   **Idiomatic Python:** Utilizing common data science libraries (`pandas`, `scipy`) effectively and following best practices.\\n    *   **Self-contained and Clear:** The code should be understandable and functional without significant external dependencies beyond the specified libraries.\\n\\n**3. Input Data Specification:**\\n*   **Prompt Evidence:**\\n    ```json\\n    {\\n      \"sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md\": {\\n        \"vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\": [\\n          null,\\n          null,\\n          null\\n        ],\\n        \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\": [\\n          null,\\n          null,\\n          null\\n        ],\\n        \"vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-flash-latest\": [\\n          null,\\n          null,\\n          null\\n        ]\\n      },\\n      \"sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md\": {\\n        // ... similar structure ...\\n      }\\n    }\\n    ```\\n    And: \"The data is a dictionary where the keys are text filenames and the values are dictionaries where the keys are model names and the values are lists of analysis results for each run.\"\\n*   **Analysis:**\\n    *   **Structure:** The data is clearly defined as a nested dictionary: `filename -> model_name -> list_of_scores`. This hierarchical structure dictates how the code must iterate and access data for analysis.\\n    *   **Data Type:** Although the example shows `null`s, the context (\"statistical analysis,\" \"scores\") implies these `null` placeholders will be replaced by numerical values in actual usage. The generated code must assume and handle numerical input for these lists.\\n    *   **Interpretation of \"runs\":** The lists (e.g., `[null, null, null]`) represent multiple independent runs or trials for a given text processed by a specific model. This is crucial for interpreting \"inter-run reliability.\"\\n\\n**4. Core Tasks and Statistical Requirements Breakdown:**\\n\\nThe prompt explicitly lists four distinct tasks for the generated Python code:\\n\\n*   **Task 1: Calculate Cronbach\\'s Alpha for Inter-run Reliability**\\n    *   **Prompt Evidence:** \"1. Calculate Cronbach\\'s alpha for each text-model pair to assess inter-run reliability.\"\\n    *   **Analysis:**\\n        *   **Target:** The calculation needs to be performed for *each list of scores* associated with a `(filename, model)` combination.\\n        *   **Purpose:** Cronbach\\'s alpha assesses the internal consistency of a set of items. In this context, the \"items\" are the individual \"runs\" for a given `text-model pair`. A high alpha value would indicate that the results from multiple runs for that specific text and model are highly consistent.\\n        *   **Library Consideration:** While `scipy` is specified, it does not directly contain a Cronbach\\'s alpha function. The AI would either need to implement it manually using `numpy`/`pandas` operations (variance, covariance) or potentially implicitly assume that `scipy`\\'s statistical tools can be combined to achieve this, or indicate that a library like `pingouin` is typically used (though explicitly excluded here). This is a potential point of friction or requiring a clever solution.\\n        *   **Edge Cases:** The code must handle cases where a `list of analysis results` has fewer than 2 items (Cronbach\\'s alpha is undefined or meaningless).\\n\\n*   **Task 2: Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation**\\n    *   **Prompt Evidence:** \"2. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the scores for each text-model pair.\"\\n    *   **Analysis:**\\n        *   **Target:** These descriptive statistics apply to the same `list of scores` for each `(filename, model)` pair.\\n        *   **Purpose:** Provide basic summaries of the central tendency and dispersion of scores for each specific text-model outcome.\\n        *   **Library Use:** `pandas` and `scipy` (or `numpy` which is usually imported with `pandas` implicitly) are well-equipped for these calculations.\\n        *   **Edge Cases:** Handle empty lists or lists with single elements gracefully (e.g., `NaN` for standard deviation of a single element).\\n\\n*   **Task 3: Perform Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**\\n    *   **Prompt Evidence:** \"3. Perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the scores between models for each text.\"\\n    *   **Analysis:**\\n        *   **Target:** This is a key inferential task. For *each individual filename*, the code needs to compare the scores *across different models*. This implies that for `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md`, all `vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-pro-latest` scores, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` scores, and `vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-flash-latest` scores would be grouped, and an ANOVA performed to see if there\\'s a significant difference between the model means for *that specific text*.\\n        *   **Purpose:** To determine if there\\'s a statistically significant difference in the mean scores produced by different models for a given text.\\n        *   **Library Use:** `scipy.stats.f_oneway` is the direct function to use for one-way ANOVA.\\n        *   **Edge Cases:** ANOVA requires at least two groups (models) with at least two data points per group (or more precisely, at least two groups with variance > 0, and total degrees of freedom > 0). The code should handle scenarios where a text only has one model, or a model has too few runs.\\n\\n*   **Task 4: Generate a Summary Report**\\n    *   **Prompt Evidence:** \"4. Generate a summary report of the statistical analysis.\"\\n    *   **Analysis:**\\n        *   **Format:** The prompt doesn\\'t specify the exact format of the \"report\" but later states \"store the results in a dictionary named \\'statistical_results\\'.\" This implies the \"summary report\" is primarily captured within the structured `statistical_results` dictionary, rather than a printed human-readable string.\\n        *   **Content:** This report should encapsulate the results from tasks 1, 2, and 3 in a well-organized manner, likely nested within the `statistical_results` dictionary.\\n\\n**5. Output Specification:**\\n*   **Prompt Evidence:** \"The code should use the pandas and scipy libraries and store the results in a dictionary named \\'statistical_results\\'.\"\\n*   **Analysis:**\\n    *   **Variable Name:** The generated code *must* assign its final output to a Python dictionary variable named `statistical_results`. This is a strict naming convention.\\n    *   **Content and Structure:** The AI needs to design the internal structure of this `statistical_results` dictionary. A logical structure would be similar to the input data, perhaps `{\\'filename\\': {\\'model_stats\\': {\\'model_name\\': {\\'mean\\': ..., \\'std\\': ..., \\'cronbach_alpha\\': ...}}, \\'anova_results\\': {\\'f_statistic\\': ..., \\'p_value\\': ...}}}`. The structure should be logical and easy to parse programmatically.\\n\\n**6. Constraints and Requirements:**\\n*   **Language:** Python.\\n*   **Libraries:** Strictly limited to `pandas` and `scipy`. This is a significant constraint, particularly for Cronbach\\'s alpha as discussed.\\n*   **Output Variable:** Must be `statistical_results`.\\n\\n**7. Inferred Logic and Potential Challenges:**\\n*   **Data Cleaning/Validation:** The \"sanitized\" filenames suggest pre-processing, but the code generator might implicitly need to handle non-numeric data if the `null` placeholders were to be replaced by something unexpected.\\n*   **Error Handling/Edge Cases:** As noted above, robust code will need to gracefully handle situations where insufficient data is available for a specific calculation (e.g., a model only has one run, or a text only has one model). Returning `NaN` or `None` for such calculations is a standard approach.\\n*   **Cronbach\\'s Alpha Implementation:** This remains the most challenging explicit constraint. The AI\\'s success will be measured by how it addresses this while adhering strictly to `pandas` and `scipy`. It might calculate it \"manually\" using variance and covariance formulas derived from these libraries.\\n*   **Clarity of Output:** The prompt implies the `statistical_results` dictionary should be well-structured and easy to interpret, likely through nested dictionaries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Overall Assessment:**\\nThe prompt is clear, specific, and well-structured, providing ample information for the AI to generate the required Python code. The persona definition (\"data science expert\") sets a high bar for code quality and statistical rigor. The primary challenge lies in the strict library constraint for Cronbach\\'s alpha, which tests the AI\\'s ability to either implement it from fundamental statistical operations available in `pandas`/`scipy` or to provide a pragmatic workaround/explanation. The nested data structure and the requirement for per-text ANOVA analyses imply a need for careful iteration and data manipulation within the generated code.', 'model_used': 'vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash', 'timestamp': 1752496931.082416, 'tpm_info': {'estimated_input_tokens': 258.7, 'estimated_output_tokens': 1749.8, 'total_tokens': 2008.5, 'model': 'vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash'}}", "metadata": {"type": "llm_response", "agent_id": "statistical_code_generator", "session_id": "session_20250714_083819", "model_name": "vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash"}}
