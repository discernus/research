The task is to perform a systematic analysis of the provided JSON data, focusing on aggregation without synthesis or arbitration.

### Ensemble Analysis Task: Aggregation_Agent Report

#### 1. Summary of All Analyses

The provided data consists of 18 individual analysis results, each representing a distinct run of an "analysis_agent" using various LLM models and input files across three different "runs" (`run_num` 1, 2, and 3).

**The overarching summary is that all 18 analysis attempts resulted in a failure.** Specifically, every `analysis_response` field uniformly contains the error message: `[ERROR] LLM call failed for [agent_id]: 'raw_response'`. There are no successful analysis responses or varied error messages present in the dataset.

#### 2. Raw Data Aggregation

The following aggregation categorizes the failures by key dimensions:

**Total Analysis Records:** 18
**Total Failed Analyses:** 18 (100% failure rate)

**Aggregation by `model_name`:**

*   `google/vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro`: 6 failures
    *   (2 files x 3 run_nums)
*   `anthropic/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620`: 6 failures
    *   (2 files x 3 run_nums)
*   `google/vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash`: 6 failures
    *   (2 files x 3 run_nums)

**Aggregation by `file_name`:**

*   `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md`: 9 failures
    *   (3 models x 3 run_nums)
*   `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md`: 9 failures
    *   (3 models x 3 run_nums)

**Aggregation by `run_num`:**

*   `run_num`: 1: 6 failures
    *   (3 models x 2 files)
*   `run_num`: 2: 6 failures
    *   (3 models x 2 files)
*   `run_num`: 3: 6 failures
    *   (3 models x 2 files)

#### 3. Basic Patterns Observed

The most prominent and only observable pattern is the **universal failure of all LLM calls**.

*   **100% Failure Rate:** Every single analysis record (18 out of 18) indicates an `[ERROR] LLM call failed`.
*   **Consistent Error Message:** The error message `LLM call failed ...: 'raw_response'` is identical across all failed attempts, suggesting a uniform failure point, possibly related to retrieving or processing the raw response from the LLM API.
*   **Model Agnostic Failure:** The failure is not specific to a single LLM provider or model. All three models tested (`google/vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro`, `anthropic/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620`, and `google/vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash`) experienced failures for all their respective runs.
*   **File Agnostic Failure:** The failure is not specific to the input `corpus_file`. Both `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md` and `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md` consistently resulted in errors.
*   **Run Agnostic Failure:** The issue persisted across all three distinct `run_num` values (1, 2, and 3), indicating the problem was not transient to a specific execution attempt.

In summary, the data reveals a complete lack of successful LLM analysis responses, with all attempts failing consistently across different models, input files, and runs with the same error signature.

#### 4. Complete Methodology Documentation

**Objective:** To generate an aggregation report from the provided list of analysis results, focusing on summary, raw data aggregation, and basic pattern observation, strictly avoiding synthesis or arbitration.

**Data Source:** A JSON array of objects, where each object represents an analysis agent's attempt.

**Data Fields Used:**
*   `agent_id`: Identifier for the analysis agent run.
*   `corpus_file`: Path to the input file.
*   `analysis_response`: The outcome of the analysis, specifically inspected for error indicators.
*   `file_name`: Extracted from `corpus_file` or explicitly provided; used for aggregation.
*   `model_name`: The specific LLM model used.
*   `run_num`: The numerical identifier for the experimental run.

**Processing Steps:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The provided text, structured as a JSON array, was parsed into a list of Python dictionaries.
2.  **Initial Scan for `analysis_response`:** Each dictionary in the list was iterated over to examine the content of the `analysis_response` field.
3.  **Error Identification:** It was observed that all `analysis_response` fields contained the exact string `[ERROR] LLM call failed for [agent_id]: 'raw_response'`. This confirmed a uniform failure state for all records.
4.  **Total Count:** The total number of analysis records was counted.
5.  **Aggregation Logic:**
    *   **By `model_name`:** A counter was maintained for each unique `model_name` encountered. For each record, the `model_name` was extracted, and its corresponding count was incremented.
    *   **By `file_name`:** A counter was maintained for each unique `file_name` encountered. For each record, the `file_name` was extracted, and its corresponding count was incremented.
    *   **By `run_num`:** A counter was maintained for each unique `run_num` encountered. For each record, the `run_num` was extracted, and its corresponding count was incremented.
6.  **Pattern Observation:** Based on the uniform error message and the aggregation counts, commonalities (e.g., 100% failure, model-agnostic, file-agnostic, run-agnostic failure) were identified without inferring causes or solutions.
7.  **Report Generation:** The gathered counts and observations were formatted into the "Summary," "Raw Data Aggregation," and "Basic Patterns Observed" sections, adhering strictly to the instruction of "No synthesis or arbitration - just clean aggregation for bias isolation." The detailed breakdown table was generated by extracting the relevant fields for each record.
