Here is the simple aggregation report from the provided analysis results, with no synthesis or arbitration, focusing on clean aggregation for bias isolation.

### 1. Summary of all analyses

*   **Total Analyses Conducted**: 18 individual analysis runs.
*   **Corpus Files Analyzed**: 2 unique speech files were analyzed, with multiple runs for each:
    *   `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md` (John McCain's concession speech)
    *   `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md` (Mitt Romney's impeachment speech)
*   **Analysis Agents/Models**: Analyses were performed by three distinct model types, each running three times on each corpus file:
    *   `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` (6 runs in total)
    *   `gpt-4o` (6 runs in total)
    *   `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (6 runs in total)
*   **Evaluation Frameworks**: Each analysis agent used its own unique set of evaluation dimensions and criteria, resulting in a diverse range of dimension names and scoring approaches across the reports.
*   **Scoring Mechanisms**: Scores were reported using various formats (e.g., `X/10`, `X/5`, `X` with implicit scale, `Mean: X`), often accompanied by different types of confidence intervals (`CI: A-B`, `±Y`, `95% CI: [A,B]`).

### 3. Basic patterns observed

*   **Model-Specific Frameworks**: Each of the three distinct model types (`claude-3-5-sonnet`, `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-haiku`) consistently uses its own unique set of evaluation dimensions and associated terminology. For example, `claude-3-5-sonnet` often includes 'Emotional Tone', 'Call to Action', and 'Historical Context', while `claude-3-haiku` uses dimensions like 'Analytical Depth', 'Objectivity', and 'Moral Foundations'. `gpt-4o` shows variations in its dimensions depending on the specific corpus file being analyzed.
*   **Consistency Across Runs (per Agent/File)**: For a given agent and corpus file combination, the set of dimensions evaluated generally remains consistent across multiple runs (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet` analyzes the same 5-6 dimensions for all three runs on the McCain speech).
*   **Variations in Scoring Scales**:
    *   `claude-3-5-sonnet` models consistently report scores out of 10 (e.g., `8/10`).
    *   `gpt-4o` models use a 1-10 scale for the McCain speech. For the Romney speech, `gpt-4o` run 1 also uses a 1-10 scale, but runs 2 and 3 of `gpt-4o` use a 1-5 scale for their dimensions, then run 3 uses a 1-10 scale for its reported `Framework Dimension Scores`.
    *   `claude-3-haiku` models report scores typically as single numbers (e.g., `4.5` or `3.75 Mean`), often with confidence intervals, but without an explicit maximum scale (e.g., `/5` or `/10`) in the reported output.
*   **Confidence Interval Formats**: Confidence intervals are presented in varied formats, including numerical ranges (e.g., `7-9`, `4.0 - 5.0`), `±` notation (e.g., `±0.5`), and array-like formats (e.g., `[3.50, 4.00]`).
*   **Inferred vs. Explicit Max Scales**: The `max_scale` field is `null` for all `claude-3-haiku` analyses because the explicit maximum scale (e.g., `/5` or `/10`) is not present in their output, aligning with the "no synthesis" requirement. Other models often explicitly state the max scale (e.g., `9/10`) or declare it in the introduction of their analysis.

### 4. Complete methodology documentation

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this aggregation report is to systematically extract and present evaluation dimensions, their scores, and associated confidence intervals from a collection of diverse analysis results. A key constraint is to adhere strictly to the principle of "no synthesis or arbitration," meaning data is reported as found, without interpretation, normalization, or inference beyond what is explicitly stated by the analysis agents themselves. This approach aims to isolate potential biases inherent in the varied frameworks and reporting styles of different agents.

**Data Source:**
The input data consists of a Python list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single analysis run. Each dictionary contains metadata about the analysis (`agent_id`, `corpus_file`, `model_name`, `run_num`) and the `analysis_response` string, which holds the detailed evaluation results.

**Extraction Process:**

1.  **Metadata Extraction**:
    *   `agent_id`: Directly extracted from the `agent_id` field.
    *   `model_name`: Directly extracted from the `model_name` field.
    *   `file_id`: A unique identifier for the analyzed document is extracted from the `corpus_file` path (e.g., `a1c5e7d2` from `projects/attesor/experiments/04_deep_smoke_test/corpus/sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md`).
    *   `run_num`: Directly extracted from the `run_num` field.

2.  **Analysis Response Parsing for Scores and Dimensions**:
    *   **Global Max Scale Detection**: Before detailed dimension parsing, the initial 500 characters of the `analysis_response` string are scanned for explicit statements about the overall scoring scale (e.g., "scores on a 1-10 scale", "on a 1-5 scale"). If such a statement is found, this `global_max_scale` is recorded and applied to dimensions that do not specify their own `max_scale`.
    *   **Response Segmentation**: The `analysis_response` text is logically segmented to isolate individual dimension analyses. This is achieved by attempting different regular expression splitting patterns in a prioritized order to accommodate the varied formatting across models:
        *   Splitting by numbered lists (e.g., `\n1. `), common in Claude models.
        *   Splitting by Markdown headers (e.g., `\n### ` or `\n#### `), common in GPT-4o models.
        *   Specialized splitting for unique formats like `claude-3-haiku`'s "Mean: X" notation within numbered lists.
        *   Introductory or concluding text segments that do not contain specific dimension scores are excluded.
    *   **Dimension Score Extraction per Segment**: Within each identified segment, a robust regular expression is applied to capture the following:
        *   `dimension_name`: The name of the evaluation dimension. Cleaning steps are applied to remove extraneous formatting (e.g., markdown `**`, numerical prefixes, leading hyphens, and trailing colons).
        *   `score`: The numerical score, parsed as a float. This covers formats like `X`, `X.X`, and the numerical part of `X/Y`.
        *   `max_scale`: The maximum possible score for the dimension. This is extracted directly if present in an `X/Y` format (e.g., `8/10` yields `10`). If `max_scale` is not explicit for a dimension, the `global_max_scale` (if detected earlier) is used. **Crucially, if neither an explicit `/Y` nor a `global_max_scale` is provided by the agent for a dimension, `max_scale` is recorded as `null` to prevent any form of inferential "arbitration."**
        *   `confidence_interval`: The reported confidence interval or margin of error, stored as the raw string provided by the agent (e.g., `7-9`, `±0.5`, `[3.50, 4.00]`). No attempt is made to standardize or interpret its numerical value.

**Output Structure:**
The final aggregated data is presented as a JSON array of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a single analysis run and contains:
*   `agent_id` (string): Unique identifier for the analysis agent and run.
*   `model_name` (string): The name of the AI model used for analysis.
*   `file_id` (string): A short identifier for the corpus file analyzed.
*   `run_num` (integer): The specific run number for the agent on that file.
*   `scores` (list of dictionaries): A list where each dictionary represents one evaluated dimension:
    *   `dimension_name` (string): The cleaned name of the evaluation dimension.
    *   `score` (float): The reported score.
    *   `max_scale` (integer or `null`): The maximum possible score, if explicitly stated or globally declared by the agent. Otherwise, `null`.
    *   `confidence_interval` (string or `null`): The confidence interval, as reported by the agent.

**Bias Isolation and Limitations:**

*   **No Synthesis or Normalization**: This methodology strictly adheres to the "no synthesis or arbitration" principle. Scores from different scales (e.g., 1-5 vs. 1-10) are not converted or normalized. Dimension names are not mapped or consolidated across agents. This allows for direct observation of each agent's native reporting structure and vocabulary, which may highlight inherent biases in their analytical frameworks.
*   **Raw Data Presentation**: Confidence intervals are presented as raw strings without parsing or interpretation to avoid introducing any external analytical bias.
*   **Reliance on Agent's Stated Scale**: The determination of `max_scale` is entirely dependent on whether the agent explicitly states it (either for individual dimensions or globally). No external inference is made about the intended scale if it is not explicitly provided.
*   **Parsing Robustness**: While the parsing logic is designed to be highly robust across the observed formats, extreme variations or malformed inputs not present in this dataset could potentially lead to incomplete or inaccurate data extraction.
*   **Absence of Interpretation**: This report deliberately omits any form of comparative analysis, statistical aggregation (beyond raw listing), or qualitative interpretation of the results. Its purpose is solely to provide a clean, raw dataset for external analysis where bias detection and deeper insights can be derived.
