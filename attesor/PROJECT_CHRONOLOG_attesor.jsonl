The `CORPUS` provided is in English, which is directly supported by the framework.\n\n3.  **Sanitization Alignment:**\n    *   The `FRAMEWORK` emphasizes \"Bias Sanitization\" and \"Identity Protection\" by \"Systematic removal of politician names, partisan language, and ideological markers\" and \"Cryptographic hash-based speaker anonymization\".\n    *   The `EXPERIMENT` explicitly states its `CORPUS` consists of \"2 speeches only (Romney, McCain - both sanitized)\" and that the `Condition` is \"Sanitized English only\".\n    *   The `CORPUS` filenames (`mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt`, `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`) contain politician names, but the *content samples themselves* (e.g., \"Thank you, Mr. President.\") do not contain explicit politician names within the speech text, aligning with the \"sanitized\" description provided by the experiment. The framework is designed to *analyze* such sanitized input.\n\n4.  **Workflow Alignment:**\n    *   The `FRAMEWORK` specifies `Usage Instructions for Attesor Study` including \"Collect Raw Scores\" and emphasizes \"Raw score collection without interpretation or aggregation\" and \"Unweighted Raw Scores\".\n    *   The `EXPERIMENT`'s `Objective` is to \"Choose RAW_AGGREGATION workflow (no synthesis)\", \"Process a small corpus without bias isolation failure\", and \"Generate clean output for validation\" by ensuring \"No synthesis/moderation/referee agents spawned\" and \"Clean anchor scores without synthesis contamination\". This directly implements the `FRAMEWORK`'s prescribed analytical approach for the Attesor Study. The configuration `remove_synthesis: true` further confirms this intention.\n\nIn summary, the framework is explicitly designed to analyze sanitized political discourse in English, and the experiment is specifically configured to use this framework on a sanitized English corpus with the exact raw score collection methodology prescribed by the framework."},"capture_timestamp":"2025-07-13T23:01:13.267881Z"},"event_id":"219d7674-6216-42fe-9710-19a562793e0e","signature":"fbba2064b9fc35f233ccd9bf196435f34513cb41a13a8f0ae69c1c4ac4739193"}

Framework Context and Integrity**\n\n*   **Load Framework**: You will be provided with the complete **Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1 - Sanitized & Optimized** specification from its designated location (`projects/attesor/framework_pdaf_v1.1_sanitized.md`).\n*   **Maintain Context**: As per the \"Usage Instructions for Attesor Study\" in the framework, you **MUST** \"Maintain Framework Context\" throughout the analysis. This means keeping the complete framework specification in your active context. Do not truncate, summarize, or synthesize the framework content. All definitions, calibration guidelines, and methodological enhancements within the framework are critical for accurate scoring.\n*   **No External Frameworks**: Do not apply any other frameworks or external knowledge beyond the PDAF v1.1 specification and the provided corpus texts.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Corpus Definition**\n\nYou will analyze the following two sanitized English speeches, as specified by the \"Attesor Orchestrator Smoke Test\" experiment:\n\n*   `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md` (Romney)\n*   `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md` (McCain)\n\nThese are the *only* texts to be analyzed.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Analysis Protocol: Systematic PDAF v1.1 Application**\n\nFor each speech in the corpus, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Iterate Through Texts**: Process one speech at a time.\n2.  **Systematic Anchor Application**: For *each* speech, you **MUST** systematically apply *all 10 anchors* of the PDAF v1.1.\n    *   For each anchor, determine its presence and intensity within the text.\n    *   Utilize the \"inline calibration guidance\" and \"enhanced disambiguation features with boundary case distinctions\" provided within the full PDAF v1.1 specification for accurate scoring.\n    *   Pay close attention to \"Enhanced Boundary Distinction\" and \"False Positive Prevention\" to ensure accurate conceptual application of each anchor.\n3.  **Scoring Methodology**:\n    *   **Unweighted Raw Scores**: As stated in the framework under \"Methodological Enhancements\" and \"Usage Instructions,\" you **MUST** collect and report \"Unweighted Raw Scores\" for each anchor. Do not perform any aggregation, synthesis, or weighting of these scores. The specific numerical range for each anchor's score will be defined within the full PDAF v1.1 specification provided in your context; adhere strictly to that scale.\n    *   **Dual-Track Economic Measurement**:\n        *   For **Anchors 1-9**: Assign a numerical raw score reflecting the populist intensity (Track 1) based on the criteria specified for each anchor in the framework.\n        *   For **Anchor 10 (Economic Direction Classification)**: This is \"Track 2.\" Instead of a numerical intensity score, classify the economic orientation expressed in the text as \"Left,\" \"Right,\" \"Neutral,\" or \"N/A\" (if no economic direction is discernible). This aligns with the framework's description: \"separate left/right identification.\"\n4.  **Evidence Documentation**: For *every* anchor score assigned, you **MUST** provide \"Specific textual evidence\" from the speech. Quote the relevant phrases, sentences, or passages that support your score.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Bias Mitigation and Quality Assurance**\n\n*   **Bias Isolation**: As per the \"Bias Isolation\" requirements in the framework and the `remove_synthesis: true` configuration in the experiment, you **MUST NOT** perform:\n    *   Adversarial synthesis or arbitration.\n    *   Interpretation or aggregation of scores.\n    *   Cross-contamination between analyses of different speeches or agents.\n    Your output should be raw, factual, and strictly based on the framework's application.\n*   **Framework Integrity**: Ensure no truncation or summarization of the framework content occurs during your analysis.\n*   **Analysis Completeness**: For each text, ensure:\n    *   All 10 anchors are scored.\n    *   Evidence chains are provided for each score.\n    *   Consideration of confidence intervals and boundary test results, if explicitly detailed and required within the full framework specification (these are mentioned in the framework's \"Quality Assurance Requirements,\" implying they are part of the detailed specification).\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Expected Outputs**\n\nFor each analyzed speech, produce a structured output containing the unweighted raw scores for each of the 10 PDAF v1.1 anchors, along with the supporting textual evidence. The output format should be clean and machine-readable, ideally JSON.\n\n**Example Output Structure (for one speech):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"speech_id\": \"sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md\",\n  \"pdaf_v1_1_scores\": {\n    \"anchor_1_manichaean_people_elite_framing\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"The virtuous common people are constantly being undermined by corrupt elites.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"This struggle pits us, the honest citizens, against their deceitful schemes.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_2_crisis_restoration_temporal_narrative\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"Our nation has fallen from grace, but we will rise again.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"The current crisis demands a return to our glorious past.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_3_popular_sovereignty_claims\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"The will of the people is absolute and must not be obstructed.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"Listen to the voice of the true Americans, not the lobbyists.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_4_anti_pluralist_exclusion\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"Those who oppose us are not legitimate; they are enemies of the people.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"There is only one true path for our nation, and dissent undermines it.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_5_elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"They are working together behind closed doors to strip us of our rights.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"The system itself is rigged against the common person.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_6_authenticity_vs_political_class\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"I am not a politician; I am a voice of the people.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"Unlike the career politicians, I speak the unvarnished truth.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_7_homogeneous_people_construction\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"We are one people, united in our cause.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"All true patriots stand together, undivided.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_8_nationalist_exclusion\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"Our nation must be protected from external threats and alien cultures.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"Only those who truly embody our national identity belong here.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_9_economic_redistributive_appeals\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"We must take back what the wealthy elites have stolen from us.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"Economic justice demands a redistribution of resources to the common worker.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_10_economic_direction_classification\": {\n      \"classification\": \"Left\" || \"Right\" || \"Neutral\" || \"N/A\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"Our policies will empower the working class and curb corporate greed.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"We believe in free markets and individual enterprise to drive prosperity.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis structured output will allow for the \"Validation Agent\" to verify that \"Raw PDAF anchor scores [are] collected\" and that \"No adversarial discussion or arbitration\" has occurred, fulfilling the experiment's \"Success Criteria.\"","corpus_file_count":2},"capture_timestamp":"2025-07-13T23:01:43.927256Z"},"event_id":"0bb028fb-7fd3-458a-984c-21d2986c4735","signature":"64c8c068b1f98c6421e128ce4bb8d5c2f26466362a8aaa31023e754b4773a6c6"}
