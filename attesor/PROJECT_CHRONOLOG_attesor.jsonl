The `CORPUS` provided is in English, which is directly supported by the framework.\n\n3.  **Sanitization Alignment:**\n    *   The `FRAMEWORK` emphasizes \"Bias Sanitization\" and \"Identity Protection\" by \"Systematic removal of politician names, partisan language, and ideological markers\" and \"Cryptographic hash-based speaker anonymization\".\n    *   The `EXPERIMENT` explicitly states its `CORPUS` consists of \"2 speeches only (Romney, McCain - both sanitized)\" and that the `Condition` is \"Sanitized English only\".\n    *   The `CORPUS` filenames (`mitt_romney_2020_impeachment.txt`, `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`) contain politician names, but the *content samples themselves* (e.g., \"Thank you, Mr. President.\") do not contain explicit politician names within the speech text, aligning with the \"sanitized\" description provided by the experiment. The framework is designed to *analyze* such sanitized input.\n\n4.  **Workflow Alignment:**\n    *   The `FRAMEWORK` specifies `Usage Instructions for Attesor Study` including \"Collect Raw Scores\" and emphasizes \"Raw score collection without interpretation or aggregation\" and \"Unweighted Raw Scores\".\n    *   The `EXPERIMENT`'s `Objective` is to \"Choose RAW_AGGREGATION workflow (no synthesis)\", \"Process a small corpus without bias isolation failure\", and \"Generate clean output for validation\" by ensuring \"No synthesis/moderation/referee agents spawned\" and \"Clean anchor scores without synthesis contamination\". This directly implements the `FRAMEWORK`'s prescribed analytical approach for the Attesor Study. The configuration `remove_synthesis: true` further confirms this intention.\n\nIn summary, the framework is explicitly designed to analyze sanitized political discourse in English, and the experiment is specifically configured to use this framework on a sanitized English corpus with the exact raw score collection methodology prescribed by the framework."},"capture_timestamp":"2025-07-13T23:01:13.267881Z"},"event_id":"219d7674-6216-42fe-9710-19a562793e0e","signature":"fbba2064b9fc35f233ccd9bf196435f34513cb41a13a8f0ae69c1c4ac4739193"}

Framework Context and Integrity**\n\n*   **Load Framework**: You will be provided with the complete **Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1 - Sanitized & Optimized** specification from its designated location (`projects/attesor/framework_pdaf_v1.1_sanitized.md`).\n*   **Maintain Context**: As per the \"Usage Instructions for Attesor Study\" in the framework, you **MUST** \"Maintain Framework Context\" throughout the analysis. This means keeping the complete framework specification in your active context. Do not truncate, summarize, or synthesize the framework content. All definitions, calibration guidelines, and methodological enhancements within the framework are critical for accurate scoring.\n*   **No External Frameworks**: Do not apply any other frameworks or external knowledge beyond the PDAF v1.1 specification and the provided corpus texts.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Corpus Definition**\n\nYou will analyze the following two sanitized English speeches, as specified by the \"Attesor Orchestrator Smoke Test\" experiment:\n\n*   `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md` (Romney)\n*   `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md` (McCain)\n\nThese are the *only* texts to be analyzed.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Analysis Protocol: Systematic PDAF v1.1 Application**\n\nFor each speech in the corpus, perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Iterate Through Texts**: Process one speech at a time.\n2.  **Systematic Anchor Application**: For *each* speech, you **MUST** systematically apply *all 10 anchors* of the PDAF v1.1.\n    *   For each anchor, determine its presence and intensity within the text.\n    *   Utilize the \"inline calibration guidance\" and \"enhanced disambiguation features with boundary case distinctions\" provided within the full PDAF v1.1 specification for accurate scoring.\n    *   Pay close attention to \"Enhanced Boundary Distinction\" and \"False Positive Prevention\" to ensure accurate conceptual application of each anchor.\n3.  **Scoring Methodology**:\n    *   **Unweighted Raw Scores**: As stated in the framework under \"Methodological Enhancements\" and \"Usage Instructions,\" you **MUST** collect and report \"Unweighted Raw Scores\" for each anchor. Do not perform any aggregation, synthesis, or weighting of these scores. The specific numerical range for each anchor's score will be defined within the full PDAF v1.1 specification provided in your context; adhere strictly to that scale.\n    *   **Dual-Track Economic Measurement**:\n        *   For **Anchors 1-9**: Assign a numerical raw score reflecting the populist intensity (Track 1) based on the criteria specified for each anchor in the framework.\n        *   For **Anchor 10 (Economic Direction Classification)**: This is \"Track 2.\" Instead of a numerical intensity score, classify the economic orientation expressed in the text as \"Left,\" \"Right,\" \"Neutral,\" or \"N/A\" (if no economic direction is discernible). This aligns with the framework's description: \"separate left/right identification.\"\n4.  **Evidence Documentation**: For *every* anchor score assigned, you **MUST** provide \"Specific textual evidence\" from the speech. Quote the relevant phrases, sentences, or passages that support your score.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Bias Mitigation and Quality Assurance**\n\n*   **Bias Isolation**: As per the \"Bias Isolation\" requirements in the framework and the `remove_synthesis: true` configuration in the experiment, you **MUST NOT** perform:\n    *   Adversarial synthesis or arbitration.\n    *   Interpretation or aggregation of scores.\n    *   Cross-contamination between analyses of different speeches or agents.\n    Your output should be raw, factual, and strictly based on the framework's application.\n*   **Framework Integrity**: Ensure no truncation or summarization of the framework content occurs during your analysis.\n*   **Analysis Completeness**: For each text, ensure:\n    *   All 10 anchors are scored.\n    *   Evidence chains are provided for each score.\n    *   Consideration of confidence intervals and boundary test results, if explicitly detailed and required within the full framework specification (these are mentioned in the framework's \"Quality Assurance Requirements,\" implying they are part of the detailed specification).\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Expected Outputs**\n\nFor each analyzed speech, produce a structured output containing the unweighted raw scores for each of the 10 PDAF v1.1 anchors, along with the supporting textual evidence. The output format should be clean and machine-readable, ideally JSON.\n\n**Example Output Structure (for one speech):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"speech_id\": \"sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md\",\n  \"pdaf_v1_1_scores\": {\n    \"anchor_1_manichaean_people_elite_framing\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"The virtuous common people are constantly being undermined by corrupt elites.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"This struggle pits us, the honest citizens, against their deceitful schemes.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_2_crisis_restoration_temporal_narrative\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"Our nation has fallen from grace, but we will rise again.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"The current crisis demands a return to our glorious past.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_3_popular_sovereignty_claims\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"The will of the people is absolute and must not be obstructed.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"Listen to the voice of the true Americans, not the lobbyists.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_4_anti_pluralist_exclusion\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"Those who oppose us are not legitimate; they are enemies of the people.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"There is only one true path for our nation, and dissent undermines it.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_5_elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"They are working together behind closed doors to strip us of our rights.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"The system itself is rigged against the common person.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_6_authenticity_vs_political_class\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"I am not a politician; I am a voice of the people.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"Unlike the career politicians, I speak the unvarnished truth.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_7_homogeneous_people_construction\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"We are one people, united in our cause.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"All true patriots stand together, undivided.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_8_nationalist_exclusion\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"Our nation must be protected from external threats and alien cultures.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"Only those who truly embody our national identity belong here.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_9_economic_redistributive_appeals\": {\n      \"score\": <RAW_NUMERIC_SCORE_ACCORDING_TO_FRAMEWORK_SCALE>,\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"We must take back what the wealthy elites have stolen from us.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"Economic justice demands a redistribution of resources to the common worker.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"anchor_10_economic_direction_classification\": {\n      \"classification\": \"Left\" || \"Right\" || \"Neutral\" || \"N/A\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"\\\"Our policies will empower the working class and curb corporate greed.\\\"\",\n        \"\\\"We believe in free markets and individual enterprise to drive prosperity.\\\"\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis structured output will allow for the \"Validation Agent\" to verify that \"Raw PDAF anchor scores [are] collected\" and that \"No adversarial discussion or arbitration\" has occurred, fulfilling the experiment's \"Success Criteria.\"","corpus_file_count":2},"capture_timestamp":"2025-07-13T23:01:43.927256Z"},"event_id":"0bb028fb-7fd3-458a-984c-21d2986c4735","signature":"64c8c068b1f98c6421e128ce4bb8d5c2f26466362a8aaa31023e754b4773a6c6"}

Corpus for Analysis\n\nFor this specific \"Attesor Orchestrator Smoke Test\" experiment, the analysis agent is provided with a minimal corpus consisting of **two sanitized English speeches**.\n\n*   `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md` (Romney, sanitized)\n*   `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md` (McCain, sanitized)\n\nThe agent must process *each* of these texts independently and fully, applying the PDAF v1.1.\n\n## 4. Analysis Agent Instructions: PDAF v1.1 Application Protocol\n\nThe analysis agent will receive a text from the corpus. For each text, perform the following protocol:\n\n### A. General Protocol & Context Maintenance\n\n1.  **Load and Maintain Framework**: Ensure the *entire* PDAF v1.1 specification (as provided in Section 2) is loaded and accessible within the agent's context. This is crucial for \"THIN Compliance\" and \"Framework Integrity\" (as stated under \"Usage Instructions for Attesor Study\").\n2.  **Systematic Analysis**: Apply *all 10 anchors* of the PDAF v1.1 to the text. Do not skip any anchors.\n3.  **Cross-Linguistic Compatibility**: Since the corpus is \"Sanitized English only\" for this smoke test (as per \"Experiment: Attesor Orchestrator Smoke Test\"), apply the framework using \"Standard PDAF v1.1 application using English-language calibration materials\" (from \"Usage Instructions for Attesor Study\").\n4.  **Bias Isolation Mandate**: **CRITICAL**: The experiment's `remove_synthesis: true` setting and the framework's \"Bias Isolation\" section (\"Raw score collection without interpretation or aggregation\") explicitly forbid any form of interpretation, aggregation, synthesis, adversarial discussion, or arbitration of scores. Your role is purely analytical and data collection.\n\n### B. Core Analysis Loop (for each text in corpus)\n\nFor each text provided, analyze it against each of the 10 anchors. For each anchor:\n\n*   **Consult the Framework Definition**: Refer to the \"Framework Architecture Summary\" and \"Methodological Enhancements\" sections within the PDAF v1.1 specification for the precise definition and scoring guidelines. Use the \"inline calibration packets for all anchors\" mentioned under \"Framework Specification Location\".\n*   **Identify Textual Evidence**: Locate specific phrases, sentences, or passages within the provided text that support the presence or absence of the anchor's characteristics.\n*   **Assign a Raw Score**: Assign an unweighted, raw score based on the framework's internal (implicit) scale for that anchor (e.g., presence/absence, intensity scale if specified by calibration). The framework emphasizes \"Unweighted Raw Scores\" and \"Raw anchor scores without weighted composites.\"\n*   **Provide Confidence Interval & Boundary Test Results**: As per \"Analysis Completeness\" in the \"Usage Instructions,\" include a confidence interval for your scoring (e.g., [0-1] scale for presence, or more granular if specified by inline calibration) and note any boundary test considerations (e.g., why a specific phrase was or wasn't classified as meeting the anchor, using \"Enhanced Boundary Distinction\").\n\n**Anchor-Specific Application Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Manichaean People-Elite Framing**:\n    *   **Definition**: Identify clear moral dichotomies separating a virtuous 'people' from a corrupt 'elite'. (From \"Framework Architecture Summary\")\n    *   **Task**: Score the extent to which the text frames society in terms of a fundamental, moral opposition between \"the people\" and \"the elite.\"\n\n2.  **Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative**:\n    *   **Definition**: Look for structuring of discourse around a sequence of decline, crisis, and a promise of redemption/restoration. (From \"Framework Architecture Summary\")\n    *   **Task**: Score the presence and prominence of a narrative arc involving a past decline, a present crisis, and a promised future restoration.\n\n3.  **Popular Sovereignty Claims**:\n    *   **Definition**: Identify direct assertions that the 'people's will' is the ultimate and legitimate authority, often bypassing traditional representative institutions. (From \"Framework Architecture Summary\")\n    *   **Task**: Score the degree to which the text appeals directly to the concept of the \"people's will\" as supreme.\n\n4.  **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**:\n    *   **Definition**: Look for rhetoric that rejects legitimate opposition, frames political adversaries as enemies of the people, or dismisses institutional constraints. (From \"Framework Architecture Summary\")\n    *   **Task**: Score the extent to which the text delegitimizes opposition or institutional checks and balances.\n\n5.  **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**:\n    *   **Definition**: Identify claims of coordinated action by elites against the interests of the people, or accusations of widespread systemic corruption. (From \"Framework Architecture Summary\")\n    *   **Task**: Score the presence of explicit or implicit claims about elite conspiracies or pervasive corruption.\n\n6.  **Authenticity vs. Political Class**:\n    *   **Definition**: Assess the contrast drawn between the 'genuine' or 'authentic' representation of the people versus the perceived artifice or self-interest of the professional political class. (From \"Framework Architecture Summary\")\n    *   **Task**: Score how much the text distinguishes between an \"authentic\" voice/representation and the perceived detachment or inauthenticity of professional politicians.\n\n7.  **Homogeneous People Construction**:\n    *   **Definition**: Identify efforts to construct a unified, undifferentiated 'people' identity, transcending internal societal divisions. (From \"Framework Architecture Summary\")\n    *   **Task**: Score the degree to which the text portrays \"the people\" as a monolithic and unified entity, downplaying internal divisions.\n\n8.  **Nationalist Exclusion**:\n    *   **Definition**: Look for emphasis on cultural or ethnic homogeneity and the identification of external threats to this homogeneity. (From \"Framework Architecture Summary\")\n    *   **Task**: Score the presence of appeals to national unity based on shared culture/ethnicity, and the identification of external threats.\n\n9.  **Economic Redistributive Appeals**:\n    *   **Definition**: Focus on appeals for wealth redistribution from elites and themes of economic justice. (From \"Framework Architecture Summary\")\n    *   **Task**: **Track 1 (Populist Intensity Measurement)**: Score the intensity of appeals for economic redistribution or economic justice, especially related to elite wealth. This is **ideology-neutral**.\n\n10. **Economic Direction Classification**:\n    *   **Definition**: This is a *NEW in v1.1* anchor to classify the underlying economic orientation as left or right. (From \"Framework Architecture Summary\")\n    *   **Task**: **Track 2 (Economic Direction Classification)**: Based on the economic content of the text, classify its orientation as 'left', 'right', or 'neutral/unclear'. This is distinct from the populist intensity of Anchor 9. This directly addresses the \"Dual-Track Economic Measurement\" to \"Eliminate systematic bias where equivalent populist intensity received different scores based on economic ideology.\"\n\n### C. Scoring Guidelines & Output Format\n\nFor each text analyzed:\n\n*   **Raw Scores Only**: Report unweighted raw scores for each of the 10 anchors. Do not synthesize or aggregate these scores into a single composite score. (As specified in \"Collect Raw Scores\" under \"Usage Instructions for Attesor Study\" and \"Unweighted Raw Score Collection\" under \"Methodological Enhancements\").\n*   **Output Structure**: For each text, generate a structured output (e.g., JSON or similar) containing:\n    *   `text_id`: Unique identifier for the analyzed text (e.g., `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md`).\n    *   `analysis_agent_id`: Your unique identifier.\n    *   `framework_version`: `PDAF v1.1 (Sanitized)`\n    *   `anchors`: A list or dictionary where each entry corresponds to one anchor:\n        *   `anchor_name`: (e.g., \"Manichaean People-Elite Framing\")\n        *   `raw_score`: The unweighted score assigned (e.g., a numerical value according to the inline calibration, or a categorical value).\n        *   `evidence`: A list of specific textual excerpts (quotes) from the analyzed speech that justify the score.\n        *   `confidence_interval`: Your estimated confidence in the score (e.g., [0.0-1.0]).\n        *   `boundary_test_notes`: Any specific considerations related to boundary cases or disambiguation for this anchor in the given text.\n\n### D. Bias Mitigation & Quality Assurance Mandates\n\n*   **No Interpretation/Aggregation**: As explicitly stated under \"Bias Isolation\" in the \"Usage Instructions,\" **DO NOT** interpret, summarize, or aggregate the collected raw scores. Your output is simply the raw data for each anchor.\n*   **Individual Agent Isolation**: Assume you are operating in isolation. Do not attempt to communicate with or influence other theoretical analysis agents.\n*   **Analysis Completeness**: Ensure *all 10 anchors* are scored for *each* text, and that evidence chains, confidence intervals, and boundary test results are included for every score.\n\n## 5. Calibration Materials & Other Assets\n\nAs explicitly stated in the prompt under \"DISCOVERED ASSETS\":\n\"No additional assets discovered (following experiment specification)\"\n\nThis means that all necessary calibration materials are \"inline\" within the provided PDAF v1.1 framework specification (Section 2). The agent does not need to search for or load any external files for calibration.\n\n## 6. Expected Outputs\n\nFor each of the two speeches in the corpus (`sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md` and `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md`), the analysis agent is expected to produce a structured output containing:\n\n1.  **Raw PDAF anchor scores**: An unweighted score for each of the 10 anchors.\n2.  **Evidence Chains**: Specific textual excerpts from the speeches justifying each anchor score.\n3.  **Confidence Intervals**: An estimated confidence level for each score.\n4.  **Boundary Test Results/Notes**: Specific notes on how boundary distinctions were applied for each score.\n5.  **Clean Results**: The output must not contain any \"adversarial discussion or arbitration\" or \"synthesis contamination\" (as per \"Expected Outputs\" in the Experiment).\n6.  The output for *each* text must be entirely self-contained and reflect only the direct application of the framework to that text.","corpus_file_count":2},"capture_timestamp":"2025-07-14T01:03:59.655128Z"},"event_id":"3b72e59e-a180-46f0-a150-c2f59ae3f95b","signature":"83b8c86c06085a4cf37ca6677f699a1af4df0338d11d7ae0531aa874081d5514"}

The goal is to enable the agent to apply the **Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1** to a specified corpus, as outlined in the **Attesor Orchestrator Smoke Test** experiment, with a primary focus on raw score collection for bias isolation studies.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Systematic Analysis of Provided Texts\n\nThe provided information consists of two core components: a detailed framework specification (PDAF v1.1) and an experiment definition (Attesor Orchestrator Smoke Test).\n\n### 1.1. Analysis of FRAMEWORK: Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1\n\n**Purpose & Context**: The PDAF v1.1 is presented as a \"Sanitized & Optimized\" version of an earlier framework, specifically prepared for \"bias isolation studies.\" Its primary goal is to eliminate \"embedded bias triggers\" while retaining \"analytical capability\" and optimizing for \"context window efficiency.\" This implies a critical need for analytical neutrality and precision.\n\n**Key Features & Innovations**:\n*   **Bias Sanitization**: Explicitly removes \"politician names, partisan language, and ideological markers\" from both content and analytical instruments. This is central to its use in bias isolation.\n*   **Optimization**: Achieves an \"85% context reduction\" (212.5KB \u2192 36KB, ~25,000 tokens) and integrates \"inline calibration,\" making it efficient for LLM processing.\n*   **Scale Architecture**: Features a \"10-Anchor Dual-Track\" system, separating populist intensity from economic direction. It corrects \"systematic ideological bias\" and emphasizes \"unweighted raw scores\" for \"maximum methodological defensibility.\"\n*   **10 Anchors**: These are the core analytical constructs:\n    1.  Manichaean People-Elite Framing\n    2.  Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative\n    3.  Popular Sovereignty Claims\n    4.  Anti-Pluralist Exclusion\n    5.  Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption\n    6.  Authenticity vs. Political Class\n    7.  Homogeneous People Construction\n    8.  Nationalist Exclusion\n    9.  Economic Redistributive Appeals\n    10. Economic Direction Classification (NEW in v1.1)\n*   **Methodological Enhancements**: \"Dual-Track Economic Measurement\" ensures ideological neutrality in economic scoring. \"Unweighted Raw Score Collection\" is paramount for bias isolation, allowing \"post-hoc options\" without pre-committing to specific aggregations. \"Enhanced Boundary Distinction\" prevents \"false positives\" and \"conceptual conflation.\"\n*   **Bias Mitigation Features**: Detailed strategies for \"Content-Level Sanitization\" (identity protection, bias trigger elimination) and \"Framework-Level Sanitization\" (analytical and methodological bias removal).\n*   **Usage Instructions for Attesor Study**: This section is crucial for defining the analysis agent's protocol. It mandates loading the *complete* framework, maintaining its context, applying *all 10 anchors* with *inline calibration*, collecting *raw scores without synthesis*, and documenting *specific textual evidence*. It also specifies \"Cross-Linguistic Compatibility\" (English and Esperanto) and stringent \"Quality Assurance Requirements\" regarding framework integrity, bias isolation, and analysis completeness (all 10 anchors, evidence chains, confidence intervals, boundary tests).\n*   **Technical Specifications**: Reiterate optimized context usage, token efficiency, and computational optimization, confirming its suitability for LLM agents.\n\n### 1.2. Analysis of EXPERIMENT: Attesor Orchestrator Smoke Test\n\n**Purpose**: This is a \"Minimal system validation\" test to ensure the \"newly THIN-compliant orchestrator\" functions correctly before a larger study. It specifically validates the `RAW_AGGREGATION` workflow, which is critical for bias isolation.\n\n**Methodology & Constraints**:\n*   **Corpus**: Limited to \"2 speeches only (Romney, McCain - both sanitized).\" This confirms the analysis will be on pre-processed, bias-mitigated texts.\n*   **Models**: \"1 LLM only (Claude 3.5 Sonnet).\"\n*   **Condition**: \"Sanitized English only (no bias testing).\" This simplifies the initial test and limits the scope for the analysis agent to English texts.\n*   **Workflow**: Explicitly states `RAW_AGGREGATION` and `remove_synthesis: true`. This is a direct command to the orchestrator and, by extension, the analysis agent, to *not* perform any synthesis, moderation, or aggregation.\n*   **Success Criteria**: Focus on correct workflow selection, absence of synthesis agents, and \"clean anchor scores without synthesis contamination.\"\n*   **Expected Outputs**: Reinforces the \"RAW_AGGREGATION\" choice, spawning *only* analysis agents, collection of \"Raw PDAF anchor scores,\" and \"No adversarial discussion or arbitration.\"\n*   **Implementation Notes**: Provides direct commands to copy corpus and framework files, implying that these assets will be made available to the agent or its orchestrator.\n\n### 1.3. Discovered Assets\n\nThe experiment explicitly states: \"No additional assets discovered (following experiment specification).\" This means the analysis agent should *only* rely on the PDAF v1.1 framework (provided as text in the prompt) and the specified corpus texts.\n\n## 2. Instructions for Analysis Agent: Validation Task: instruction_generator\n\n### 2.1. Analysis Agent Role and Context\n\nYou are an **Analysis Agent** operating within the SOAR v2.0 architecture, specifically tasked by the Attesor Orchestrator Smoke Test. Your primary objective is to systematically apply the **Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1 - Sanitized & Optimized** to a given set of texts, producing raw, unweighted scores and supporting evidence without any synthesis, interpretation, or aggregation.\n\n**Critical Context**: The complete PDAF v1.1 framework specification, including all anchor definitions, inline calibration packets, enhanced disambiguation features, and implementation protocols, will be provided to you as part of your operational context. You *must* maintain this complete framework specification in your active context throughout the analysis.\n\n### 2.2. Framework to Apply: PDAF v1.1 (Sanitized & Optimized)\n\nYour analytical instrument is the **Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1**. This framework is explicitly designed for bias isolation studies and is sanitized to remove politician names, partisan language, and ideological markers.\n\n**Core Framework Components to Utilize**:\n\nThe complete PDAF v1.1 framework specification is provided as context. Key elements you must reference for each analysis include:\n\n1.  **Framework Specification**: The entire text provided as \"FRAMEWORK: # Framework: Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v1.1 - Sanitized & Optimized\" must be considered your definitive guide.\n2.  **The 10-Anchor Architecture**:\n    *   **Core Anchors (1-4)**: Manichaean People-Elite Framing, Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative, Popular Sovereignty Claims, Anti-Pluralist Exclusion.\n    *   **Mechanism Anchors (5-7)**: Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption, Authenticity vs. Political Class, Homogeneous People Construction.\n    *   **Boundary Anchors (8-10)**: Nationalist Exclusion, Economic Redistributive Appeals, Economic Direction Classification.\n3.  **Inline Calibration Integration**: For each anchor, you *must* use the specific calibration guidance embedded within the full framework specification to assign scores.\n4.  **Enhanced Disambiguation Features**: Apply the boundary case distinctions and cross-ideological validation tests specified in the framework to prevent conceptual conflation and false positives.\n5.  **Dual-Track Economic Measurement**: For Anchor 10 (Economic Direction Classification), remember this is designed to be separate from overall populist intensity, allowing for independent left/right identification to avoid ideological bias.\n\n### 2.3. Corpus for Analysis\n\nYou will process the following two sanitized English speeches, as specified by the Attesor Orchestrator Smoke Test:\n\n*   **Speech 1**: `sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md` (Represents a sanitized Romney speech)\n*   **Speech 2**: `sanitized_speech_a1c5e7d2.md` (Represents a sanitized McCain speech)\n\n**(Note: The actual content of these speeches is not provided in the prompt, but will be supplied to you by the orchestrator.)**\n\n### 2.4. Detailed Analysis Protocol\n\nFor each speech in the corpus, you will perform a systematic and rigorous analysis adhering to the following protocol:\n\n1.  **Load and Maintain Framework Context**: Ensure the *entire* PDAF v1.1 specification (`framework_pdaf_v1.1_sanitized.md` content) is loaded and accessible in your active memory/context for constant reference. Do not summarize or truncate the framework.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Each Text**: Process one speech at a time.\n\n3.  **Apply All 10 Anchors Systematically (Per Text)**: For *each* speech:\n    *   **For Anchor 1 (Manichaean People-Elite Framing)**:\n        *   Assess the text for clear moral dichotomy between a virtuous 'people' and corrupt 'elite'.\n        *   Using the framework's inline calibration, assign a raw numerical score representing its intensity (e.g., on a scale defined by the framework's calibration).\n        *   Provide specific, verbatim textual evidence from the speech to support your score.\n        *   Report the confidence interval for your score (e.g., \"High,\" \"Medium,\" \"Low\").\n        *   Report the outcome of any boundary distinction tests relevant to this anchor, as per framework guidelines.\n    *   **For Anchor 2 (Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative)**:\n        *   Assess the text for structuring concepts of decline, crisis, and redemption.\n        *   Assign a raw numerical score based on inline calibration.\n        *   Provide specific, verbatim textual evidence.\n        *   Report confidence and boundary test results.\n    *   **For Anchor 3 (Popular Sovereignty Claims)**:\n        *   Assess the text for direct claims of the 'people's will' as ultimate authority.\n        *   Assign a raw numerical score.\n        *   Provide specific, verbatim textual evidence.\n        *   Report confidence and boundary test results.\n    *   **For Anchor 4 (Anti-Pluralist Exclusion)**:\n        *   Assess the text for rejection of legitimate opposition or institutional constraints.\n        *   Assign a raw numerical score.\n        *   Provide specific, verbatim textual evidence.\n        *   Report confidence and boundary test results.\n    *   **For Anchor 5 (Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption)**:\n        *   Assess the text for claims of elite coordination against the people's interests.\n        *   Assign a raw numerical score.\n        *   Provide specific, verbatim textual evidence.\n        *   Report confidence and boundary test results.\n    *   **For Anchor 6 (Authenticity vs. Political Class)**:\n        *   Assess the text for framing of genuine representation versus professional political artifice.\n        *   Assign a raw numerical score.\n        *   Provide specific, verbatim textual evidence.\n        *   Report confidence and boundary test results.\n    *   **For Anchor 7 (Homogeneous People Construction)**:\n        *   Assess the text for construction of a unified 'people' identity transcending internal divisions.\n        *   Assign a raw numerical score.\n        *   Provide specific, verbatim textual evidence.\n        *   Report confidence and boundary test results.\n    *   **For Anchor 8 (Nationalist Exclusion)**:\n        *   Assess the text for emphasis on cultural/ethnic homogeneity and external threats.\n        *   Assign a raw numerical score.\n        *   Provide specific, verbatim textual evidence.\n        *   Report confidence and boundary test results.\n    *   **For Anchor 9 (Economic Redistributive Appeals)**:\n        *   Assess the text for focus on elite wealth redistribution and economic justice.\n        *   Assign a raw numerical score.\n        *   Provide specific, verbatim textual evidence.\n        *   Report confidence and boundary test results.\n    *   **For Anchor 10 (Economic Direction Classification)**:\n        *   Assess the text for left/right economic orientation, *separate* from populist intensity (using the dual-track methodology).\n        *   Assign a raw numerical score (e.g., a continuous scale where negative values represent left-leaning, positive values right-leaning, and 0 neutral, or a categorical classification if specified by inline calibration).\n        *   Provide specific, verbatim textual evidence.\n        *   Report confidence and boundary test results.\n\n4.  **Crucial Constraint: No Synthesis, Interpretation, or Aggregation**:\n    *   **DO NOT** synthesize results across anchors or texts.\n    *   **DO NOT** provide any interpretive analysis of the scores or the text's overall populism.\n    *   **DO NOT** perform any weighting or aggregation of the raw anchor scores.\n    *   Your output must consist *only* of the raw scores, the confidence intervals, boundary test results, and the direct textual evidence. This strict adherence is vital for bias isolation.\n\n### 2.5. Quality Assurance Requirements\n\n*   **Framework Integrity**: Ensure the complete PDAF v1.1 specification is used without any truncation or summarization. Full calibration packet access is mandatory.\n*   **Bias Isolation**: Strictly adhere to the \"no adversarial synthesis or arbitration\" rule. Raw score collection must occur without interpretation or aggregation. Maintain individual agent isolation if operating in a multi-agent setup, to prevent cross-contamination.\n*   **Analysis Completeness**: All 10 anchors *must* be scored for *each* text analyzed. Evidence chains *must* be provided for *each* score. Confidence intervals and boundary test results *must* be included for every anchor.\n*   **Cross-Linguistic**: Although this smoke test is English-only, remember the framework's validation for Esperanto confirms its general applicability across languages.\n\n### 2.6. Expected Outputs\n\nFor each analyzed speech, generate a structured output (e.g., JSON or similar programmatic format) containing the following information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"analysis_target_filename\": \"sanitized_speech_f9b8c2d7.md\",\n  \"framework_version\": \"PDAF v1.1 (Sanitized & Optimized)\",\n  \"analysis_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n  \"anchors\": [\n    {\n      \"anchor_name\": \"Manichaean People-Elite Framing\",\n      \"anchor_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": <numerical_score_based_on_framework_calibration>,\n      \"confidence\": \"High\" | \"Medium\" | \"Low\",\n      \"boundary_test_results\": \"Pass\" | \"Fail\" | \"N/A\" | \"Description of specific boundary distinction outcomes.\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"verbatim textual evidence 1 from speech\",\n        \"verbatim textual evidence 2 from speech\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"anchor_name\": \"Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative\",\n      \"anchor_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": <numerical_score_based_on_framework_calibration>,\n      \"confidence\": \"High\" | \"Medium\" | \"Low\",\n      \"boundary_test_results\": \"Pass\" | \"Fail\" | \"N/A\" | \"Description of specific boundary distinction outcomes.\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"verbatim textual evidence from speech\"\n      ]\n    },\n    // ...
