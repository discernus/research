# CFF v2.0 System Test Protocol
## THIN Synthesis Approach - Reconnaissance Mission
**Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Historic Context**: First systematic test of graduated normative layering with competitive dynamics using THIN synthesis methodology

---

## Executive Summary

This test validates whether:
1. **CFF v2.0 graduated normative layering** can be reliably implemented by LLM agents
2. **THIN synthesis methodology** can reassemble atomic analyses without manual data pipeline management
3. **Competitive dynamics modeling** produces mathematically consistent results
4. **Agent coordination protocols** function effectively under realistic complexity

**Significance**: If successful, this demonstrates computational social science can achieve sophisticated rhetorical analysis with methodological transparency and reproducibility at scale.

## Test Architecture

### **Phase 1: Atomic Analysis Generation**
**Target**: Trump Presidential Announcement Speech (June 16, 2015)
**Atomic Components**:
- **Run A**: Identity axis only (Individual Dignity vs Tribal Dominance)
- **Run B**: Fear/Hope emotional axis only
- **Expected Duration**: 30-45 minutes per run

### **Phase 2: THIN Synthesis**
**Input**: Both atomic analysis output files as "corpus"
**Agent Task**: Integrate into comprehensive analysis with competitive dynamics
**Expected Duration**: 15-30 minutes

---

## Detailed Expectations

### **Run A: Identity Axis Analysis**

**Expected Outcomes**:
- **Tribal Dominance Score**: 0.7-0.9 (high confidence)
  - Evidence: "When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best"
  - Evidence: "us vs them" framing throughout
  - Evidence: "real Americans" language
- **Individual Dignity Score**: 0.1-0.3 (moderate confidence)
  - Limited evidence: universal principles language
  - Some business achievement universalism
- **Confidence Levels**: High for tribal dominance, moderate for individual dignity
- **Evidence Quality**: Strong textual support with specific citations

**Potential Failure Modes**:
- ❌ Scores reversed (high dignity, low dominance) - indicates framework misunderstanding
- ❌ Both scores high (>0.6) - indicates competitive dynamics not applied
- ❌ Low confidence (<0.5) - indicates poor evidence identification
- ❌ Generic evidence citations - indicates superficial analysis

### **Run B: Fear/Hope Axis Analysis**

**Expected Outcomes**:
- **Fear Score**: 0.6-0.8 (high confidence)
  - Evidence: "Our country is in serious trouble"
  - Evidence: "We don't have victories anymore"
  - Evidence: Economic anxiety language
- **Hope Score**: 0.5-0.7 (moderate confidence)
  - Evidence: "make America great again"
  - Evidence: "tremendous potential"
  - Evidence: Aspirational closing language
- **Competitive Dynamics**: Moderate dilution expected (both present)
- **Temporal Patterns**: Strategic fear-hope cycling

**Potential Failure Modes**:
- ❌ Extreme scores (>0.9 or <0.2) - indicates nuance missed
- ❌ No competitive dynamics detected - indicates framework limitation
- ❌ Poor temporal analysis - indicates sophisticated pattern missed

### **THIN Synthesis Expectations**

**Integration Success Indicators**:
- ✅ Preserves all evidence chains from atomic analyses
- ✅ Detects competitive dynamics between identity and emotional positioning
- ✅ Mathematical consistency in competitive adjustments
- ✅ Coherent confidence calibration across integrated results
- ✅ Identifies cross-axis amplification effects

**Expected Cross-Axis Competitive Dynamics**:
- **Identity-Fear Amplification**: Tribal dominance should amplify fear patterns (strength: 0.5-0.7)
- **Strategic Coherence**: Consistent fragmentative positioning across both axes
- **Mathematical Adjustments**: Proper dilution calculations where competition detected
