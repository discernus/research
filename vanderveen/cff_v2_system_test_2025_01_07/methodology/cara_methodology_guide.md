# CARA Methodology Guide v1.0
## Conversational Academic Research Architecture for Computational Rhetoric Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

The Conversational Academic Research Architecture (CARA) Methodology Guide provides framework-agnostic operational guidance for conducting computational rhetoric analysis using conversational AI agents. This guide establishes core principles for agent coordination, quality assurance, and result synthesis while preserving flexibility for diverse research approaches and novel methodological innovations.

**Core Philosophy**: Provide robust defaults for common research patterns while enabling complete customization when research needs require different approaches. CARA prioritizes researcher intent over methodological rigidity, with agents serving as intelligent collaborators rather than constrained executors.

**Framework Integration**: This guide works with any analytical framework implemented in Discernus. Framework-specific methodology guidance is embedded within individual framework specifications (e.g., CFF v2.0 graduated layering protocols, CVF virtue/vice analysis procedures).

## Part 1: Agent Templates and Coordination Patterns

### 1.1 Agent Architecture Philosophy

CARA research employs flexible agent templates coordinated through conversational handoffs rather than rigid orchestration. Agent configurations adapt to research needs, with researchers and orchestrator agents free to modify roles, create novel agent types, or customize workflows based on specific analytical requirements.

**Customization Hierarchy**:
1. **Researcher Intent** (highest priority - always overrides defaults)
2. **Agent Recommendations** (intelligent suggestions based on research context)
3. **Template Defaults** (starting point configurations)

**Template vs. Rigid Roles**: The following agent descriptions represent commonly successful patterns, not mandatory configurations. Researchers should treat these as starting points for customization rather than constraints.

#### Common Agent Templates

### 1.3 Framework-Agnostic Communication Protocols

#### Conversation Handoff Patterns

**Sequential Analysis Pattern**
```

     ↓              ↓                    ↓                     ↓
   Results      CFF Analysis      Competition Analysis    Final Report
```

**Parallel Analysis Pattern**
```
                    Discovery Agent Results
                           ↓
    Framework Agent A ← Orchestrator → Framework Agent B
           ↓                               ↓
    Layer 1 Analysis                Layer 2 Analysis
           ↓                               ↓
                    Synthesis Referee
```

**Adversarial Review Pattern**
```
Primary Analysis → Adversarial Agent → Disagreement? → Referee Resolution
                        ↓                   ↓
                 Challenge Results      Yes: Adjudication

**Low Confidence (0.0-0.4)**:
- Weak or ambiguous evidence
- High interpretive uncertainty
- Inconsistent or contradictory patterns
- Framework applicability questionable
- Multiple plausible interpretations

#### Uncertainty Flag Categories

**Evidence Quality Flags**:

- `temporal_incoherence`: Inconsistent patterns over time
- `strategic_ambiguity`: Deliberate mixed messaging detected

### 3.2 Disagreement Detection and Resolution

#### Disagreement Classification
