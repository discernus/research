# Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v2.0
## Advanced Hybrid Instruction Package for Discernus Research Agents

---

## Executive Summary

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v2.0 is an advanced multidimensional analysis framework designed for computational rhetoric analysis within the Discernus CARA (Conversational Academic Research Architecture) platform. The framework incorporates detailed language cues, competitive dynamics modeling, and comprehensive validation protocols for reliable LLM-driven research.

**Core Innovation**: Five orthogonal axes enabling **graduated normative layering** - the ability to scale analysis from purely descriptive emotional mapping to fully normative social health assessment. This architecture provides analytical flexibility, allowing researchers to choose their level of normative engagement while maintaining methodological transparency.

**Key Capabilities**: 
- **Descriptive Layer**: Neutral emotional climate mapping
- **Motivational Layer**: Behavioral orientation analysis with implicit normativity  
- **Fully Normative Layer**: Explicit moral evaluation and social health assessment

## Part 1: Enhanced Narrative Instructions

### Theoretical Foundation

CFF v2.0 synthesizes political psychology, social identity theory, and emotional appraisal models to analyze discourse along five critical dimensions of social cohesion and flourishing. Unlike normatively-bound frameworks, CFF supports layered analysis from descriptive emotional climate through motivational orientation to normative social health assessment.

### CFF's Graduated Normative Layering: Core Architectural Feature

CFF's primary capability is **graduated normative layering** - the systematic ability to scale analysis depth from neutral description to explicit moral evaluation. This architecture enables researchers to choose their level of normative engagement while maintaining methodological transparency.

#### Layer 1: Descriptive Layer (Neutral Emotional Climate Analysis)
**Scope**: Three emotion axes only - Fear/Hope, Envy/Compersion, Enmity/Amity
**Normative Status**: Neutral/descriptive - no explicit moral judgment
**Output**: Affective landscape mapping, emotional climate assessment
**Use Cases**: 
- Journalism requiring objectivity
- Academic research emphasizing descriptive validity
- Cross-cultural analysis avoiding Western normative bias
- Baseline emotional climate documentation

**Analytical Protocol**:
- Focus exclusively on emotional cue detection
- Avoid cohesive/fragmentative language in reporting
- Present findings as "emotional patterns" rather than "social health indicators"
- Maintain neutral tone in all interpretive language

#### Layer 2: Motivational Layer (Behavioral Orientation with Implicit Normativity)
**Scope**: Emotion axes + Goal axis (Power vs Generosity)
**Normative Status**: Implicit normativity through behavioral assessment
**Output**: Motivational trajectory analysis, behavioral orientation mapping
**Use Cases**:
- Policy analysis requiring behavioral prediction
- Organizational communication assessment
- Campaign strategy evaluation
- Leadership style analysis

**Analytical Protocol**:
- Integrate emotional patterns with motivational orientations
- Assess behavioral implications and likely outcomes
- Introduce moderate normative language around "effective" vs "counterproductive" patterns
- Bridge descriptive findings with practical implications

#### Layer 3: Fully Normative Layer (Comprehensive Social Health Assessment)
**Scope**: All five axes including foundational Identity axis (Individual Dignity vs Tribal Dominance)
**Normative Status**: Explicit moral evaluation and prescriptive guidance
**Output**: Cohesive Flourishing Index, social health assessment, democratic discourse quality evaluation
**Use Cases**:
- Democratic health monitoring
- Civic education curriculum development
- Social cohesion policy evaluation
- Moral leadership assessment

**Analytical Protocol**:
- Incorporate foundational identity analysis
- Apply full cohesive/fragmentative framework
- Generate explicit moral evaluations and recommendations
- Provide prescriptive guidance for improving social health

#### Layer Selection Decision Tree for Research Agents

```
Query Analysis → 
├── Research Context Assessment
│   ├── Descriptive Research (journalism, cultural analysis) → Layer 1
│   ├── Policy/Strategy Analysis (campaigns, organizations) → Layer 2  
│   └── Normative Assessment (democratic health, civic education) → Layer 3
├── User Specifications
│   ├── "Neutral analysis" or "objective mapping" → Layer 1
│   ├── "Behavioral implications" or "strategic assessment" → Layer 2
│   └── "Social health" or "democratic quality" → Layer 3
└── Institutional Context
    ├── Academic/Journalistic Standards → Layer 1 or 2
    ├── Policy Development → Layer 2 or 3
    └── Civic/Educational Mission → Layer 3
```

#### Cross-Layer Compatibility and Escalation

**Progressive Depth Protocol**: Analysis can begin at Layer 1 and escalate based on findings or user request:
- **Layer 1 → 2**: When emotional patterns suggest clear motivational implications
- **Layer 2 → 3**: When behavioral patterns have significant social cohesion implications
- **Full Layer 3**: When comprehensive moral evaluation is explicitly requested

**Transparency Requirements**: Always specify which layer is being applied and why, ensuring users understand the normative implications of their chosen analytical depth.

### CFF as Computational Rhetorical Analysis Framework

CFF v2.0 is designed for computational rhetorical analysis (CRA), focusing on systematic analysis of discourse rather than institutional assessment. The framework integrates quantitative and qualitative rhetorical measurements through:

#### Rhetorical Analysis Integration
- **Discourse-Level Analysis**: Multi-layered semantic analysis from lexical items to rhetorical strategies
- **Pragmatic Context Sensitivity**: Speaker/audience/genre-aware interpretation protocols  
- **Rhetorical Situation Modeling**: Adaptation to communicative context and purpose
- **Computational Linguistics Integration**: Language pattern recognition and discourse feature analysis

#### Text-Focused Analysis Approach
- **Primary Unit**: Individual texts, speeches, documents
- **Rhetorical Effectiveness**: How language choices achieve persuasive goals across CFF dimensions
- **Discourse Strategy Analysis**: Competitive dynamics between rhetorical approaches within texts
- **Multi-Level Precision**: Sentence and passage-level analysis with cumulative text-level assessment

### 3.1 Graduated Normative Layering Methodology

#### Layer Selection Decision Protocols

**Automatic Layer Selection Criteria**:
```
Query Analysis → Layer Recommendation
├── Language Analysis
│   ├── "Describe" / "Map" / "Neutral" → Layer 1 (Descriptive)
│   ├── "Strategy" / "Effectiveness" / "Behavior" → Layer 2 (Motivational)  
│   └── "Should" / "Moral" / "Social Health" → Layer 3 (Normative)
├── Context Analysis
│   ├── Academic/Journalistic → Layer 1 or 2
│   ├── Policy Development → Layer 2 or 3
│   └── Civic Education → Layer 3
└── User Specification → Honor explicit requests
```

**Escalation Decision Tree**:
```
Layer 1 Analysis Results → Escalation Assessment
├── Strong Motivational Implications Detected
│   └── Suggest Layer 2 + Require User Consent
├── Social Cohesion Concerns Identified  
│   └── Suggest Layer 3 + Require User Consent
└── No Escalation Triggers
    └── Complete Layer 1 Analysis
```

#### Layer-Specific Analysis Protocols

**Layer 1 (Descriptive) Agent Instructions**:
```
Focus: Pure emotional climate analysis without normative judgment
Axes: Fear/Hope, Envy/Compersion, Enmity/Amity only
Language: Neutral, descriptive terminology
Output: "Emotional patterns" not "social health indicators"
Prohibited: Cohesive/fragmentative language, moral assessments
Quality Standard: Accurate emotional mapping with cultural sensitivity
```

**Layer 2 (Motivational) Agent Instructions**:
```
Focus: Behavioral implications and strategic effectiveness
Axes: All emotion axes + Goal axis (Power vs Generosity)
Language: Strategic assessment with implicit normativity
Output: Motivational trajectories and behavioral predictions
Approach: Bridge emotional patterns to practical implications
Quality Standard: Actionable insights with strategic coherence
```

**Layer 3 (Fully Normative) Agent Instructions**:
```
Focus: Comprehensive social health and moral evaluation
Axes: All five axes including Identity (core moral foundation)
Language: Explicit moral evaluation and prescriptive guidance
Output: Social health assessment with cohesive/fragmentative analysis
Approach: Full moral evaluation with democratic discourse quality assessment
Quality Standard: Rigorous normative analysis with prescriptive recommendations
```

#### Transparency and Disclosure Requirements

**Mandatory Disclosures**:
- **Active Layer**: Always specify which layer is being applied
- **Normative Status**: Explain moral implications of chosen layer
- **Methodology**: Describe analytical approach and constraints
- **Limitations**: Acknowledge what is excluded at current layer

**User Consent Protocols**:
- **Layer 1**: No consent required (neutral analysis)
- **Layer 2**: Inform user of implicit normative elements  
- **Layer 3**: Require explicit consent for moral evaluation
- **Escalation**: Always obtain permission before moving to higher normative layers

### 3.2 Competitive Dynamics Implementation

#### Multi-Axis Competition Modeling

**Competition Detection Algorithms**:
```
For each text analysis:
1. Calculate pole scores across all active axes
2. Identify competing pole pairs (opposite poles on same axis)
3. Assess cross-axis interaction strength
4. Apply mathematical competition adjustments
5. Document competition effects and strategic implications
```

**Competition Effect Application**:
- **Dilution**: High scores on both poles reduce both (multiplication factor 0.7)
- **Replacement**: Dominant pole (>0.8) suppresses competitor (subtraction factor)
- **Amplification**: Aligned poles across axes boost each other (addition factor)
- **Crowding**: Multiple high poles create analytical uncertainty flags

#### Temporal Coherence Tracking

**Evolution Pattern Detection**:
- **Drift**: Gradual movement in positioning over time
- **Oscillation**: Regular back-and-forth between positions
- **Polarization**: Movement toward extreme positions
- **Restoration**: Return to previous stable positioning
- **Fragmentation**: Loss of coherent positioning

**Velocity and Acceleration Metrics**:
- Track rate of change in axis positioning
- Identify sudden shifts requiring explanation
- Flag incoherent temporal patterns for review
- Document strategic vs accidental position changes

### 3.3 Quality Assurance Protocols

#### Evidence Quality Standards

**Citation Requirements**:
- **Explicit Lexical**: Direct quotes supporting pole scores
- **Semantic Patterns**: Discourse features with contextual explanation
- **Implicit Indicators**: Subtle cues with interpretive justification
- **Rhetorical Devices**: Persuasive techniques with effectiveness assessment

**Confidence Calibration Guidelines**:
- **High Confidence** (0.8-1.0): Clear evidence, expert consensus, low uncertainty
- **Medium Confidence** (0.5-0.7): Moderate evidence, some ambiguity, manageable uncertainty
- **Low Confidence** (0.0-0.4): Weak evidence, high ambiguity, multiple interpretations

#### Escalation Triggers

**Quality Issues Requiring Review**:
- Cross-axis correlation >0.8 (independence violation)
- Competition dynamics inconsistency
- Temporal incoherence (unexplained sudden shifts)
- Framework fit metrics below thresholds (territorial coverage <0.85)
- Novel patterns not covered by existing language cues

**Human Escalation Conditions**:
- Confidence levels <0.6 on core dimensions
- Unresolvable disagreement between agents
- Cultural context missing for accurate analysis
- Novel frameworks needed for adequate coverage

### 3.4 Cross-Layer Validation Protocols

#### Layer Coherence Checks

**Layer 1 → Layer 2 Validation**:
- Emotional patterns should logically connect to motivational orientations
- Behavioral implications should follow from affective climate
- Strategic assessment should align with emotional competitive dynamics
- No contradictions between descriptive and motivational findings

**Layer 2 → Layer 3 Validation**:
- Motivational patterns should connect to identity foundations
- Social health assessment should follow from behavioral implications
- Moral evaluations should be grounded in empirical patterns
- Prescriptive recommendations should address identified concerns

**Full Cross-Layer Coherence**:
- Emotional climate supports motivational assessment
- Motivational orientation aligns with identity positioning
- Social health evaluation reflects empirical patterns
- All layers tell coherent analytical story

#### Methodological Consistency

**Analysis Approach Consistency**:
- Same evidence standards across all layers
- Consistent confidence calibration methodology
- Uniform competitive dynamics application
- Coherent temporal analysis approach

**Documentation Standards**:
- Complete reasoning chains for layer selections
- Full evidence trails across escalations
- Transparent disagreement documentation
- Comprehensive uncertainty quantification

### 3.5 Integration with CARA Architecture

#### Agent Coordination for CFF Analysis

**Framework Analyst Configuration**:
- **Layer 1 Specialists**: Emotion-focused agents with cultural competency
- **Layer 2 Analysts**: Strategic communication experts with behavioral focus
- **Layer 3 Evaluators**: Moral philosophy experts with social health expertise
- **Layer Integration Agents**: Cross-layer coherence and escalation specialists

**Orchestrator Agent Protocols**:
- Monitor for escalation triggers during analysis
- Coordinate layer transitions with user consent
- Ensure cross-layer validation and coherence
- Manage quality assurance and uncertainty flags

#### RAG Integration Optimization

**Layer-Specific Information Retrieval**:
- **Layer 1 Agents**: Emotion axis definitions, descriptive language cues, neutral analysis protocols
- **Layer 2 Agents**: Goal axis specifications, strategic assessment methods, behavioral implication models
- **Layer 3 Agents**: Identity axis definitions, normative evaluation protocols, social health metrics
- **All Agents**: Competitive dynamics models, temporal analysis methods, validation protocols

**Context Window Management**:
- Prioritize information relevant to assigned layer
- Include cross-layer validation requirements
- Preserve escalation decision criteria
- Maintain transparency and disclosure protocols

This CFF-specific methodology ensures that the framework's unique graduated normative layering capabilities are properly implemented while integrating seamlessly with the general CARA conversational research architecture.
