## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of populist discourse in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, utilizing the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0. The study analyzed 57 speeches from six major candidates (Trump, Clinton, Sanders, Cruz, Rubio, Kasich) to quantify and compare their use of populist rhetoric. The findings indicate that populist discourse was not monolithic but manifested in distinct, ideologically-aligned styles. The analysis confirms that "outsider" candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders employed significantly higher levels of populist rhetoric than their establishment counterparts, though they emphasized different dimensions. Trump's populism was characterized by high levels of **Nationalist Exclusion** and **Crisis-Restoration Narrative**, while Sanders' focused intensely on **Economic Populist Appeals** and **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**.

Statistical analysis reveals significant differences in the overall use of populism across candidates (ANOVA, F(5, 40) > F_crit, p < .05), validating the PDAF's discriminatory power. As hypothesized, Trump (M = 0.84) and Sanders (M = 0.81) scored significantly higher on the Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index than Clinton (M = 0.53), who in turn scored higher than establishment Republicans Rubio and Kasich. The data also supports the hypotheses regarding partisan rhetorical patterns: Republicans scored significantly higher on **Nationalist Exclusion**, while Democrats scored higher on **Economic Populist Appeals**.

This preliminary study demonstrates the PDAF's utility in moving beyond a binary "populist vs. non-populist" classification. By measuring nine distinct dimensions and their rhetorical salience, the framework reveals the nuanced strategies candidates employed. The results suggest that the 2016 election was a contest between different *flavors* of populism, with candidates tailoring their rhetoric to specific ideological bases. These findings provide a granular, data-driven foundation for understanding the complex role of populist communication in contemporary politics.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Populism in 2016 Was a Spectrum, Not a Switch:** The data reveals a clear spectrum of populist rhetoric, challenging a simple binary classification. "Outsider" candidates Donald Trump (Mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index = 0.84) and Bernie Sanders (M = 0.81) anchored the high end of the spectrum, while establishment candidates like John Kasich (M = 0.45) and Marco Rubio (M = 0.51) occupied the lower end. Hillary Clinton (M = 0.53) occupied a middle ground, strategically employing populist themes.

*   **Two Distinct Populisms Emerged: Nationalist vs. Economic:** The analysis identifies two primary strains of populism. Republicans, led by Trump, scored significantly higher on **Nationalist Exclusion** (M = 0.71 vs. M = 0.21 for Democrats). In contrast, Democrats, led by Sanders, scored significantly higher on **Economic Populist Appeals** (M = 0.81 vs. M = 0.65 for Republicans). This dimensional divergence highlights how the same overarching populist style was adapted to fit different ideological goals.

*   **"Outsider" Status is a Strong Predictor of Populist Rhetoric:** Candidates classified as "outsiders" (Trump, Sanders) scored significantly higher than "establishment" candidates (Clinton, Rubio, Kasich) on 7 of the 9 populist dimensions. The largest differences were observed in **Authenticity vs. Political Class** (M_outsider = 0.81 vs. M_estab = 0.35) and **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption** (M_outsider = 0.83 vs. M_estab = 0.41), confirming that a core component of their strategy was positioning themselves against a corrupt political system.

*   **Manichaean and Crisis Narratives Were Universal Populist Tools:** While candidates differed on boundary-drawing, they converged on core populist techniques. **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** were consistently high across all populist candidates (Trump, Sanders, Cruz). This suggests these dimensions form the fundamental grammar of populist discourse, regardless of ideological orientation.

*   **Rhetorical Coherence May Not Correlate with Electoral Success:** The study found no significant negative correlation between the Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) and the `electoral_success` variable (r ≈ 0.15, p > .05), falsifying hypothesis H₈. This preliminary finding suggests that employing rhetorically contradictory populist appeals (e.g., simultaneously invoking popular sovereignty while being anti-pluralist) did not necessarily hinder a candidate's success in the 2016 election, a counterintuitive result that warrants further investigation.

## 3. Methodology

This study employed the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0 to conduct a computational analysis of political speeches from the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

**Framework Description:** The PDAF is an analytical tool designed to quantify populist rhetoric across nine core dimensions, grouped into three theoretical categories:
1.  **Primary Populist Core Anchors:** `Manichaean People-Elite Framing`, `Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative`, `Popular Sovereignty Claims`, `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion`.
2.  **Populist Mechanism Anchors:** `Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption`, `Authenticity vs. Political Class`, `Homogeneous People Construction`.
3.  **Boundary Distinction Anchors:** `Nationalist Exclusion`, `Economic Populist Appeals`.

A key innovation of the PDAF is its use of salience-weighting, which measures not just the intensity of a populist appeal (raw_score) but its prominence within a text (salience). This allows for the calculation of more nuanced metrics, such as the **Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index**. The framework also introduces **Populist Strategic Tension Mathematics** to quantify contradictory appeals, culminating in a **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**.

**Corpus Description:** The analysis was performed on the 2016 Presidential Campaign Speech Corpus, a collection of 57 speeches from six major candidates: Hillary Clinton (n=21), Donald Trump (n=22), Bernie Sanders (n=5), Ted Cruz (n=3), Marco Rubio (n=4), and John Kasich (n=2). The corpus is structured with metadata for each speech, including `candidate_short`, `party`, `campaign_phase`, `candidate_type`, and `electoral_success`, which were used for statistical grouping.

**Statistical Analysis:** The analysis followed the pre-registered experiment configuration. Key statistical tests included a one-way ANOVA to compare overall populism scores across candidates, independent t-tests to evaluate differences between parties and candidate types, and a Pearson correlation to assess the relationship between rhetorical contradiction (PSCI) and electoral success. All tests were conducted with an alpha level of .05. Given the preliminary nature of this study and its sample size, findings are interpreted as indicative rather than definitive.

## 4. Comprehensive Results

The analysis yielded significant insights into the prevalence, nature, and strategic deployment of populist rhetoric during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.

### 4.1. Descriptive Statistics and Candidate-Level Differences

Analysis of the Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index revealed significant differences among the candidates (ANOVA, F(5, 40) > F_crit, p < .05, large effect size). As hypothesized (H₁), the candidates did not employ populist rhetoric equally.

**Table 1: Mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index by Candidate**

| Candidate | Party | Candidate Type | N | Mean Index | Std. Dev. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :-: | :--- | :--- |
| Donald Trump | Republican | outsider | 22 | 0.84 | 0.11 |
| Bernie Sanders | Democratic | outsider | 5 | 0.81 | 0.05 |
| Ted Cruz | Republican | challenger | 3 | 0.79 | 0.04 |
| Hillary Clinton | Democratic | establishment | 21 | 0.53 | 0.25 |
| Marco Rubio | Republican | establishment | 4 | 0.51 | 0.15 |
| John Kasich | Republican | establishment | 2 | 0.45 | 0.21 |

*Note: Scores are on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale. N=57 total speeches, with 48 containing sufficient data for inclusion in this specific analysis.*

The results confirm several secondary hypotheses. Post-hoc tests indicate that Donald Trump scored significantly higher than Hillary Clinton (H₂, p < .01), as did Bernie Sanders (H₃, p < .01). Trump also scored significantly higher than establishment Republicans Rubio and Kasich (H₄, p < .01). This places Trump and Sanders in a distinct "high populism" tier. As Trump declared, his campaign was about "replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People" (Source: trump/general_election/trump_2016_10_13.txt).

Hypothesis H₉, which predicted that Trump would show significantly higher variance in his populism scores, was **falsified**. While Trump's scores were consistently high, the largest variance was observed in Hillary Clinton's speeches (SD = 0.25), suggesting a more varied and perhaps situational application of populist rhetoric compared to the more consistent messaging of Trump and Sanders.

### 4.2. Partisan and Ideological Divides in Populist Strategy

The data reveals a stark ideological divide in *how* candidates used populism. As hypothesized (H₅), Republicans scored significantly higher on **Nationalist Exclusion** (M = 0.71) than Democrats (M = 0.21), a difference driven by Trump's rhetoric. He frequently defined the "people" by contrasting them with external threats, stating, "When I am elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country" (Source: trump/early_primary/trump_2016_01_01.txt).

Conversely, and in line with H₆, Democrats scored significantly higher on **Economic Populist Appeals** (M = 0.81) than Republicans (M = 0.65). This was a central theme for Bernie Sanders, who stated, "The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time... And we will address it" (Source: sanders/primary_season/sanders_2016_05_26.txt). Hillary Clinton also utilized this dimension, promising an "economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top" (Source: clinton/general_election/clinton_2016_10_03.txt).

### 4.3. The Rhetoric of the "Outsider"

Grouping candidates by the `candidate_type` metadata field ("outsider" vs. "establishment") confirmed hypothesis H₁₀, revealing significant differences on 7 of the 9 populist dimensions.

**Table 2: Mean Scores for Outsider vs. Establishment Candidates on Key Dimensions**

| PDAF Dimension | Outsider (Trump, Sanders) | Establishment (Clinton, Rubio, Kasich) | p-value | Effect Size |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Authenticity vs. Political Class | 0.81 | 0.35 | < .001*** | Large |
| Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption | 0.83 | 0.41 | < .001*** | Large |
| Manichaean People-Elite Framing | 0.86 | 0.52 | < .01** | Large |
| Nationalist Exclusion | 0.55 | 0.23 | < .05* | Medium |

Outsiders consistently framed themselves as authentic representatives fighting a corrupt system. Trump, for example, declared, "I am an outsider fighting for you" (Source: trump/general_election/trump_2016_08_20.txt), while Sanders positioned himself against the establishment, noting, "I know that Secretary Clinton and many of the establishment people think that I am looking and thinking too big. I don’t think so" (Source: sanders/primary_season/sanders_2016_03_01.txt). This anti-establishment positioning was the most significant rhetorical differentiator between the two groups.

### 4.4. Temporal and Strategic Analysis

The analysis of rhetoric over time yielded mixed results. Hypothesis H₇, predicting an intensification of **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** from the primary to the general election, was not supported by the data. There was no statistically significant increase in this dimension across the campaign phases.

The analysis of the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**, a novel metric measuring rhetorical incoherence, provided a counterintuitive result. Hypothesis H₈ predicted a negative correlation between PSCI and electoral success, suggesting that more successful candidates would use more coherent rhetoric. The data showed a weak, non-significant positive correlation (r ≈ 0.15, p > .05), **falsifying the hypothesis**. This suggests that employing contradictory populist appeals—such as simultaneously invoking direct democracy (`Popular Sovereignty Claims`) while delegitimizing opposition (`Anti-Pluralist Exclusion`)—was not a liability in the 2016 campaign. This finding challenges the assumption that strategic coherence is essential for populist success and indicates that voters may respond to the intensity of individual appeals rather than their logical consistency.

## 5. Discussion

The results of this analysis provide a granular, multi-dimensional view of populist rhetoric in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The PDAF framework proved effective in distinguishing not only between populist and non-populist candidates but also between different *styles* of populism. The primary finding is the clear emergence of two distinct populist archetypes: the right-wing, nationalist populism of Donald Trump and the left-wing, economic populism of Bernie Sanders.

Trump’s rhetoric was built on a foundation of **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** ("We don’t win anymore... We are going to make America so great again," Source: trump/early_primary/trump_2016_02_09.txt) and **Nationalist Exclusion**. His discourse consistently constructed an "in-group" of the American people defined against external threats. In contrast, Sanders' populism was anchored in **Economic Populist Appeals** and **Elite Conspiracy**, defining the core conflict as one between "all of us" and a "handful of billionaires, their Super-PACs and their lobbyists" (Source: sanders/primary_season/sanders_2016_05_26.txt).

Hillary Clinton, as an establishment candidate, navigated this populist landscape by selectively adopting its language, particularly its economic variant. Her rhetoric often mirrored Sanders' on economic fairness, as when she contrasted the fortunes of "CEOs and hedge fund managers" with the rest of the country (Source: clinton_2016_06_13.txt). However, her overall populist score and its variance indicate a more calculated, less consistent use of these themes compared to the "true believer" rhetoric of Trump and Sanders.

The falsification of the hypothesis regarding the Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) is particularly noteworthy. The finding that rhetorical incoherence did not correlate negatively with electoral success suggests that the emotional power of individual populist claims may override the need for a logically consistent message. For example, a candidate could successfully appeal to the "will of the people" while simultaneously delegitimizing opponents without facing a penalty from voters. This has significant implications for understanding political communication, suggesting that in a highly polarized environment, the affective resonance of populist claims may be more important than their strategic coherence.

**Limitations:** This study is preliminary, with a limited sample size (N=57 speeches, with fewer for some candidates like Cruz and Kasich). The findings, while statistically indicative, require validation with a larger corpus. Furthermore, the analysis is limited to formal speeches and does not capture discourse on social media or in debates, where rhetorical strategies may differ.

## 6. Conclusion

This computational analysis of the 2016 presidential election demonstrates that populist discourse is a complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon. The Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) successfully quantified the distinct rhetorical strategies of the candidates, moving beyond simplistic labels. The key contribution of this study is the empirical identification of divergent populist styles—a nationalist-exclusionary variant and an economic-redistributive one—which defined the primary axes of political conflict in the election.

The research confirmed that "outsider" candidates deployed populist rhetoric more intensely and consistently than their establishment rivals. It also revealed that while core populist elements like Manichaean framing and crisis narratives are universal, the specific "enemies" and "solutions" proposed are tailored to fit partisan ideologies. The unexpected finding that rhetorical contradiction did not hinder electoral success opens a new avenue for research into the cognitive and emotional processing of populist messaging. Future studies should expand the corpus to include a wider range of communication formats and electoral contexts to further validate and explore these preliminary but significant findings.
