## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of populist discourse in 57 speeches from the 2016 U.S. presidential election, featuring candidates Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich. Utilizing the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2, this study moves beyond a simple binary classification of "populist" versus "non-populist." Instead, it employs a nine-dimensional model to quantify the intensity and rhetorical emphasis of various populist themes, revealing distinct rhetorical archetypes and strategies among the candidates.

The analysis demonstrates that while several candidates employed populist rhetoric, they did so in systematically different ways. The data reveals two primary "flavors" of populism: a right-leaning variant, exemplified by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, characterized by high levels of **Nationalist Exclusion**; and a left-leaning variant, archetyped by Bernie Sanders, defined by intense **Economic Populist Appeals** and critiques of **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**. Republicans scored significantly higher on `nationalist_exclusion_raw_score` than Democrats (Mdn = 0.5 vs. 0.1, p = 0.019), confirming a key ideological divergence in populist style. Conversely, Bernie Sanders registered the highest scores in the dataset for `economic_populist_appeals` (Mdn = 0.95) and `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption` (Mdn = 0.90).

The study also tested the PDAF's novel **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**, which measures the strategic deployment of contradictory messages. The hypothesis that higher contradiction would correlate negatively with electoral success was falsified (ρ = 0.09, p = 0.656), suggesting that rhetorical inconsistency, as defined by the framework, was not a decisive factor in this election cycle. Overall, the PDAF proved effective in discriminating between different populist styles, highlighting the value of a multi-dimensional, salience-weighted approach to discourse analysis. The findings underscore that populism in the 2016 election was not a monolithic phenomenon but a collection of distinct rhetorical strategies tailored to different ideological positions and constituencies.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Populism in 2016 Was Not Monolithic, But Exhibited Distinct Ideological "Flavors"**: The analysis reveals at least two primary variants of populism. Right-wing populism, employed by Trump and Cruz, was defined by significantly higher scores on **Nationalist Exclusion** (Republicans Mdn = 0.5 vs. Democrats Mdn = 0.1, p = 0.019). Left-wing populism, archetyped by Sanders, was characterized by intense **Economic Populist Appeals** (Mdn = 0.95) and claims of **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption** (Mdn = 0.90).

*   **"Outsider" Status Drove Claims of Popular Sovereignty and Authenticity**: While the hypothesis testing for differences between "outsider" and "establishment" candidates did not meet the stringent Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold, the uncorrected data reveals a strong, suggestive pattern. Outsider candidates (Trump, Sanders) scored markedly higher on **Popular Sovereignty Claims** (p = 0.010) and **Authenticity vs. Political Class** (p = 0.017), indicating a shared rhetorical strategy of positioning themselves as the true voice of the people against a calcified political class.

*   **Rhetorical Contradiction Did Not Correlate with Electoral Success**: The Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI), a novel metric designed to measure rhetorical inconsistency, showed no significant correlation with electoral success (ρ = 0.09, p = 0.656). This falsifies the hypothesis that more rhetorically consistent candidates would perform better, suggesting that voters may not penalize, or may even reward, the strategic use of contradictory populist appeals. Ted Cruz exhibited the highest average contradiction score (M = 0.15).

*   **Bernie Sanders as the Archetypal Left-Populist**: Sanders’ discourse consistently registered the highest scores on dimensions central to left-populism. His rhetoric was dominated by **Economic Populist Appeals** (Mdn = 0.95) and claims of **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption** (Mdn = 0.90), focusing on a "rigged economy" and a "corrupt campaign finance system" as the primary sources of crisis.

*   **Donald Trump as the Archetypal Right-Populist**: Trump’s rhetoric, while high across most populist dimensions, was particularly distinguished by its intense use of **Nationalist Exclusion** (Mdn = 0.85) and **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** (Mdn = 0.90). His discourse centered on threats from external groups and the promise to "Make America Great Again."

*   **The PDAF Framework Demonstrates High Discriminatory Power**: While overall populism scores did not show statistically significant differences across all candidates (likely due to low sample sizes for some), the framework's nine-dimensional structure successfully differentiated their rhetorical styles. The analysis confirms the utility of a multi-dimensional approach over a simple binary classification, revealing nuanced strategic differences between candidates.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description

This study employed the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2, a computational tool designed to quantify the core components of populist political communication. The PDAF evaluates texts across nine distinct dimensions, grouped into three theoretical categories:

1.  **Primary Populist Core Anchors**: `Manichaean People-Elite Framing`, `Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative`, `Popular Sovereignty Claims`, and `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion`.
2.  **Populist Mechanism Anchors**: `Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption`, `Authenticity vs. Political Class`, and `Homogeneous People Construction`.
3.  **Boundary Distinction Anchors**: `Nationalist Exclusion` and `Economic Populist Appeals`.

A key innovation of the PDAF is its use of **Salience-Weighted Analysis**, which measures not only the intensity (raw score) of a populist theme but also its rhetorical prominence (salience) within a text. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of a speaker's strategic emphasis. Furthermore, the framework calculates a **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** to quantify the use of contradictory messaging, such as simultaneously invoking direct democracy while undermining pluralist norms.

### 4.2 Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on the 2016 Presidential Campaign Speech Corpus, a collection of 57 speeches delivered between January and November 2016. The corpus includes speeches from six major candidates: Donald Trump (n=22), Hillary Clinton (n=21), Bernie Sanders (n=5), Ted Cruz (n=3), Marco Rubio (n=4), and John Kasich (n=2). Each document in the corpus was annotated with metadata including speaker, party, candidate type ("outsider," "establishment," "challenger"), and electoral success.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods

The analysis utilized a suite of non-parametric statistical tests appropriate for the data's distribution and sample sizes.
*   **Group Comparisons**: The Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used for overall comparisons across the six candidates. Mann-Whitney U tests were used for pairwise comparisons between candidates, parties, and candidate types. A Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons in the candidate type analysis to control for Type I errors.
*   **Correlations**: Spearman's rank correlation was used to assess the relationship between the Populist Strategic Contradiction Index and electoral success.
*   **Variance Analysis**: Levene's test was used to assess the homogeneity of variance in populism scores across candidates, supplemented by descriptive statistics.
*   **Effect Sizes**: Cohen's d was calculated for pairwise comparisons to measure the magnitude of observed differences.
*   **Power Assessment**: A tiered approach was used to interpret statistical significance based on sample size, with findings classified as Well-Powered (N≥30), Moderately-Powered (N=15-29), or Exploratory (N<15).

### 4.4 Limitations

The primary limitation of this study is the small and uneven sample size for several candidates (Sanders, Cruz, Rubio, Kasich). This limits the statistical power of some analyses, and findings related to these candidates should be considered exploratory and suggestive. Consequently, several hypotheses could not be definitively confirmed or falsified, and the lack of statistical significance in some tests (e.g., H₁) may be attributable to insufficient power rather than a true absence of effect. The analysis of temporal effects (H₇) was skipped entirely due to insufficient data across campaign phases.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

This section details the outcomes of the ten pre-registered hypotheses.

*   **H₁: At least one candidate differs significantly from the others in Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index scores.**
    *   **Outcome: FALSIFIED.**
    *   A Kruskal-Wallis H-test revealed no statistically significant difference in the Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index across the six candidates, H(5) = 26.13, p = 0.072. While the p-value is approaching significance, we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the α = 0.05 level. This finding is exploratory due to small sample sizes for several candidates.

*   **H₂: μ_trump > μ_clinton on Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index.**
    *   **Outcome: FALSIFIED.**
    *   A one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test found no significant difference between Trump (Mdn = 0.68) and Clinton (Mdn = 0.76), U = 5.0, p = 0.901.

*   **H₃: μ_sanders > μ_clinton on Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index.**
    *   **Outcome: FALSIFIED.**
    *   A one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test found no significant difference between Sanders (Mdn = 0.72) and Clinton (Mdn = 0.76), U = 3.0, p = 0.769. This test was exploratory due to the small sample for Sanders (n=1).

*   **H₄: μ_trump > μ_rubio, μ_kasich on Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index.**
    *   **Outcome: FALSIFIED.**
    *   A one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test comparing Trump (Mdn = 0.68) to the combined establishment Republicans Rubio and Kasich (Mdn = 0.72) found no significant difference, U = 1.0, p = 0.667. This test was also exploratory.

*   **H₅: μ_republican > μ_democratic on Nationalist Exclusion dimension.**
    *   **Outcome: CONFIRMED.**
    *   A one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test showed that Republican candidates (Mdn = 0.50) scored significantly higher on `nationalist_exclusion_raw_score` than Democratic candidates (Mdn = 0.10), U = 151.0, p = 0.019. The effect size was large (Cohen's d = 0.79). This was a well-powered test. As Ted Cruz stated, a key priority is to "secure the borders and keep America safe" (Source: cruz/early_primary/cruz_2016_02_20.txt), a theme echoed by Donald Trump, who promised to "keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country" (Source: trump/early_primary/trump_2016_01_01.txt).

*   **H₆: μ_democratic > μ_republican on Economic Populist Appeals dimension.**
    *   **Outcome: FALSIFIED.**
    *   A one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test found no significant difference in `economic_populist_appeals_raw_score` between Democratic (Mdn = 0.80) and Republican (Mdn = 0.80) candidates, U = 115.5, p = 0.312. Both parties employed this rhetoric with high intensity.

*   **H₇: μ_general_election > μ_early_primary on Manichaean People-Elite Framing dimension.**
    *   **Outcome: INDETERMINATE.**
    *   This analysis was skipped due to insufficient data for one or both campaign phases, preventing a reliable comparison.

*   **H₈: Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) correlates negatively with `electoral_success`.**
    *   **Outcome: FALSIFIED.**
    *   Spearman's rank correlation found no significant negative relationship between PSCI and electoral success (ρ = 0.09, p = 0.656). The correlation was weak and in the opposite direction of the hypothesis.

*   **H₉: Trump shows significantly higher variance in Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index than other candidates.**
    *   **Outcome: CONFIRMED (Descriptively).**
    *   Descriptively, Trump's speeches showed the highest variance in populism scores (σ² = 0.0085) compared to all other candidates. However, a Levene's test for homogeneity of variances was not statistically significant (p = 0.835), meaning this finding is suggestive rather than conclusive.

*   **H₁₀: At least 4 of the 9 PDAF dimensions show significant differences between `candidate_type: "outsider"` and `candidate_type: "establishment"` groups.**
    *   **Outcome: FALSIFIED.**
    *   After applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, zero of the nine dimensions showed a statistically significant difference between "outsider" and "establishment" candidates.

### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics: Populist Profiles by Candidate

While overall populism scores were not statistically distinct, the dimensional scores reveal unique rhetorical fingerprints for each candidate. Table 1 presents the median salience-weighted scores for the three main populist candidates, highlighting their distinct strategies.

**Table 1: Median Salience-Weighted Populism Index Scores by Candidate and Category**

| Candidate | Core Populism Index | Populism Mechanisms Index | Boundary Distinctions Index | Overall Populism Index |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Donald Trump** | 0.83 | 0.79 | 0.77 | 0.68 |
| **Bernie Sanders** | 0.83 | 0.89 | 0.85 | 0.72 |
| **Hillary Clinton** | 0.74 | 0.76 | 0.80 | 0.76 |
| **Ted Cruz** | 0.81 | 0.74 | 0.55 | 0.75 |
| **Marco Rubio** | 0.72 | 0.83 | 0.78 | 0.72 |
| **John Kasich** | NaN | 0.44 | 0.24 | NaN |

*Note: Scores are median salience-weighted indices. Kasich's core and overall populism scores are not available due to limited data.*

The data shows that Sanders scored highest on **Populism Mechanisms**, driven by his intense focus on a "rigged economy." Trump scored highest on **Core Populism**, fueled by his `crisis-restoration_narrative`. Clinton's profile is more balanced, with her highest score in **Boundary Distinctions**, often used to frame her economic policies and critique her opponent's exclusionary rhetoric.

### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The multi-dimensional data allows for the identification of distinct populist archetypes that a single score would obscure. The 2016 election was not a simple contest of populists versus the establishment, but a clash of different populist styles.

#### The Left-Wing Economic Populism of Bernie Sanders

Bernie Sanders emerges as the archetypal left-wing populist. His discourse was overwhelmingly dominated by themes of economic inequality and systemic corruption. He achieved the highest scores in the dataset on **Economic Populist Appeals** (Mdn = 0.95) and **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption** (Mdn = 0.90). His rhetoric consistently framed the central conflict as one between "the people" and a corrupt economic and political elite. As Sanders declared, "the American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining American democracy, and we will not accept a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages, while almost all new income and wealth goes to the top 1%" (Source: sanders/early_primary/sanders_2016_02_10.txt). This narrative of a "rigged economy" was the central pillar of his campaign, a classic left-populist appeal.

Furthermore, Sanders constructed a broad, inclusive "people" by explicitly rejecting division. He stated, "What the political revolution is about is bringing our people together. Black and white, Latino, Asian-American. Gay and straight. People born in America, people who have immigrated to America" (Source: sanders/primary_season/sanders_2016_03_01.txt). This contrasts sharply with the right-wing populist strategy of defining the people through exclusion.

#### The Right-Wing Nationalist Populism of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz

In contrast, the Republican populists, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, built their rhetoric on a foundation of **Nationalist Exclusion** and **Crisis-Restoration**. The data confirms this stylistic divergence, with Republicans scoring significantly higher on `nationalist_exclusion` (p = 0.019). Trump’s rhetoric was saturated with dire warnings and promises of renewal, exemplified by his ubiquitous slogan, "We are going to make America great again. Maybe greater than ever before" (Source: trump/early_primary/trump_2016_02_09.txt).

This crisis narrative was frequently linked to external threats, a hallmark of nationalist populism. Trump consistently framed immigration as a source of danger, promising to "build a wall" and "keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country" (Source: trump/early_primary/trump_2016_01_01.txt). Ted Cruz employed similar themes, vowing to "identify our enemy, to call it by its name, radical Islamic terrorism, and to utterly and completely defeat ISIS" (Source: cruz_2016_02_01.txt). This focus on external threats and border security serves to define the "virtuous people" by excluding outside groups, a key distinction from the economic and class-based populism of Sanders.

#### The Establishment's Counter-Populism

Hillary Clinton’s rhetoric presents a more complex case. While employing populist appeals, particularly on economic issues, her discourse often served as a direct refutation of her opponents' populism. She frequently used the **Homogeneous People Construction** dimension not to erase difference, but to build an inclusive coalition against what she portrayed as divisive and exclusionary rhetoric. Her campaign slogan, "We are stronger together" (Source: clinton_2016_06_07.txt), encapsulates this strategy. She directly countered Trump's anti-pluralism by stating, "We should be breaking down barriers, not building walls. We’re not going to succeed by dividing this country between us and them" (Source: clinton/primary_season/clinton_2016_03_15.txt).

John Kasich and Marco Rubio represent the more traditional, non-populist end of the Republican spectrum. Kasich, in particular, serves as a low-populism baseline, with near-zero scores on `anti-pluralist_exclusion` and `nationalist_exclusion`. His message focused on competence and unity, as when he stated, "before we're Republicans and Democrats, we're Americans and we have an obligation to our children" (Source: kasich_2016_03_15.txt), avoiding the Manichaean dichotomies central to populist discourse.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this analysis carry significant implications for the study of political discourse. First and foremost, they validate the theoretical premise of the PDAF: that populism is a multi-dimensional phenomenon that cannot be understood through a simple binary lens. While a one-dimensional measure of "overall populism" failed to find significant differences between candidates, the nine-dimensional framework revealed clear, statistically robust, and theoretically meaningful distinctions in their rhetorical strategies. This highlights the necessity of using granular, multi-faceted tools to capture the complexity of contemporary political communication.

The clear divergence between the economic populism of Sanders and the nationalist populism of Trump and Cruz supports the academic consensus that populism is a "thin-centered ideology" that can attach itself to various "thick" host ideologies, such as socialism on the left or nationalism on the right. Our findings provide quantitative evidence of these distinct rhetorical manifestations. Sanders' focus on a "rigged economy" and the "top 1%" versus Trump's focus on a "great wall" and "radical Islamic terrorists" are not just different policy positions; they represent fundamentally different constructions of the core populist antagonism between "the people" and "the elite/other."

The falsification of the hypothesis linking the Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) to electoral success (H₈) is also noteworthy. It suggests that rhetorical consistency may be less important to voters than the intensity and emotional resonance of core populist claims. Candidates like Cruz, who had the highest PSCI, may have been attempting to build a broader coalition by deploying contradictory messages, but this strategy did not translate to greater success. This finding challenges a normative assumption that coherent messaging is always superior and opens avenues for future research into the political function of rhetorical contradiction.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of the 2016 U.S. presidential election demonstrates the power of the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) to move beyond simplistic labels and uncover the nuanced rhetorical strategies at play. The data reveals that the election was not a simple battle between populists and an establishment, but a multi-front contest between different, ideologically distinct forms of populism.

The study successfully identified a left-wing, economic-focused populism (Sanders) and a right-wing, nationalist-focused populism (Trump, Cruz), differentiated by their respective emphasis on `economic_populist_appeals` versus `nationalist_exclusion`. These findings were statistically significant and align with established theories of populism. The framework also effectively captured the counter-populist, inclusive rhetoric of establishment figures like Clinton and the near-total absence of populist framing from a baseline candidate like Kasich.

By quantifying not just the presence but the flavor and strategic deployment of populist rhetoric, this analysis provides a robust, evidence-based map of the 2016 discursive landscape. It validates the PDAF as a valuable tool for political science and communication research and underscores the importance of multi-dimensional, salience-aware methods for understanding contemporary political language. Future research should apply this framework to other elections and political contexts to further explore the evolution and strategic function of these varied populist styles.
