The user wants me to analyze a political speech by Hillary Clinton using a provided framework.
I need to perform three independent analyses, then aggregate the results by taking the median score for each dimension and selecting the best evidence quote.

Here's the plan:
1.  **Decode the framework and document.**
2.  **Define the dimensions** from the framework.
    *   manichaean_people_elite_framing
    *   crisis_restoration_narrative
    *   popular_sovereignty_claims
    *   anti_pluralist_exclusion
    *   elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption
    *   authenticity_vs_political_class
    *   homogeneous_people_construction
    *   nationalist_exclusion
    *   economic_populist_appeals
3.  **Perform "Evidence-First Analysis" (Approach 1):**
    *   Read through the document focusing on explicit statements and clear indicators for each dimension.
    *   Score each dimension (raw_score, salience, confidence) and extract textual evidence.
4.  **Perform "Context-Weighted Analysis" (Approach 2):**
    *   Read through the document emphasizing rhetorical context, structural positioning, and thematic centrality for each dimension.
    *   Score each dimension (raw_score, salience, confidence) and extract textual evidence.
5.  **Perform "Pattern-Based Analysis" (Approach 3):**
    *   Read through the document looking for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis for each dimension.
    *   Score each dimension (raw_score, salience, confidence) and extract textual evidence.
6.  **Aggregate Results:**
    *   For each dimension, calculate the median `raw_score`, `salience`, and `confidence` across the three approaches.
    *   For each dimension, select the "BEST" evidence quote (most representative or highest confidence) from the three approaches.
7.  **Format the final JSON output.**

Let's start by decoding the framework and document.

**Framework Details:**
*   **Framework Name:** populist_discourse_analysis_framework
*   **Framework Version:** 10.0.0
*   **Dimensions:**
    1.  `manichaean_people_elite_framing`: Moral dichotomy between pure people and corrupt elites.
    2.  `crisis_restoration_narrative`: Decline-crisis-redemption temporal structuring.
    3.  `popular_sovereignty_claims`: Direct people's will as ultimate political authority.
    4.  `anti_pluralist_exclusion`: Rejection of legitimate opposition and institutional constraints.
    5.  `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption`: Elite coordination against people's interests through hidden networks or institutional capture.
    6.  `authenticity_vs_political_class`: Genuine representation vs. professional politician artifice.
    7.  `homogeneous_people_construction`: Unified people identity transcending internal divisions.
    8.  `nationalist_exclusion`: Cultural/ethnic homogeneity and external threat emphasis.
    9.  `economic_populist_appeals`: Populist economic discourse regardless of ideological direction.

**Document Content (clinton/general_election/clinton_2016_08_11.txt):**
Hillary Clinton's speech focuses heavily on economic issues, contrasting her plans with Donald Trump's.
She paints a picture of current economic challenges ("too much inequality, too little upward mobility," "costs like prescription drugs and childcare") but frames them as problems that *can* be solved through common sense and working together, not an existential crisis requiring radical overthrow.
She emphasizes American resilience and capacity ("We are builders," "We are resilient, determined, hard-working").
She positions herself as a champion of "everyday Americans," "working families," and small businesses, contrasting this with Trump who she portrays as enriching himself and the wealthy elite at others' expense.
She implicitly critiques political gridlock ("powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress") but frames it as something to be overcome by bringing people together, rather than rejecting the system outright.
She makes specific policy proposals for job creation, infrastructure, clean energy, education, and fair trade.
She frames Trump's actions and policies as against the interests of working people ("stiffing small businesses," "pay lower tax rate than middle class families").
She uses personal anecdotes about her grandfather and father to establish her connection to "middle class" and "factory worker" roots, implying authenticity and understanding of working people's struggles.
She also emphasizes bringing people together ("If we do it together," "We are stronger together").

**Approach 1: Evidence-First Analysis**

*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing:**
    *   **Score:** 0.6 (Medium) - She clearly contrasts her policies and values (for "everyday Americans," "working families") with Trump and "powerful special interests," "the super-rich," "Wall Street," which implies a dichotomy. However, it's less about "pure people" vs. "corrupt elite" morally, and more about "those who work for everyone" vs. "those who work for themselves."
    *   **Salience:** 0.7 - This framing is a consistent theme throughout the speech, especially in her direct comparisons with Trump.
    *   **Evidence:** "My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top." (Strong "us vs them" framing) and "Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.8

*   **crisis_restoration_narrative:**
    *   **Score:** 0.5 (Medium) - She acknowledges challenges ("economic challenges," "too much inequality") and past failures ("promised now ring hollow"). She offers a path to restoration ("build the kind of progress that America deserves to see," "get back to doing that") but it's more about improving existing systems rather than a catastrophic decline requiring radical redemption.
    *   **Salience:** 0.6 - It's a recurring sub-theme, setting up her solutions.
    *   **Evidence:** "Those challenges emerged long before the Great Recession, and they have persisted through our recovery. There is too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today." (Crisis acknowledgement) and "America's best days are still ahead of us if we make up our minds to actually go out and make that happen." (Restoration promise).
    *   **Confidence:** 0.8

*   **popular_sovereignty_claims:**
    *   **Score:** 0.2 (Minimal) - She uses phrases like "the American people," but it's generally in the context of voters making a choice or beneficiaries of policy, not as a direct, unmediated political authority bypassing institutions. She emphasizes working with both parties and within the system.
    *   **Salience:** 0.1 - Not a central theme.
    *   **Evidence:** "I hope the American people will ask of both candidates." (Voter choice, not supreme will)
    *   **Confidence:** 0.7

*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion:**
    *   **Score:** 0.2 (Minimal) - She strongly criticizes Trump but doesn't delegitimize him as an "enemy of the people" or suggest his views are illegitimate. She attributes gridlock to "special interests" and "ideology" rather than systemic opposition being inherently bad. She calls for working "with both parties" and finding "common ground."
    *   **Salience:** 0.1 - Minimal focus.
    *   **Evidence:** "I just don't think insults and bullying is how we're going to get things done." (Critiques style, not legitimacy of opponent) and "I know it’s hard to imagine, but there was a time when Democrats and Republicans actually worked together." (Advocates pluralism).
    *   **Confidence:** 0.8

*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption:**
    *   **Score:** 0.4 (Low-Medium) - She mentions "powerful special interests" and corporations benefiting from tax loopholes, implying some coordinated action. She critiques Trump for "stiffing small businesses" and not paying his fair share, painting him as part of a system that benefits the rich. However, it doesn't rise to the level of "hidden networks" or "institutional capture" conspiracies.
    *   **Salience:** 0.5 - It's a recurring critique against Trump's economic policies.
    *   **Evidence:** "Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress." and "Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich, should finally pay their fair share of taxes."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.7

*   **authenticity_vs_political_class:**
    *   **Score:** 0.7 (Medium-High) - She uses personal anecdotes ("I am the product of the American middle class," "my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill for 50 years," "my Dad was able to go to college") to establish her connection to "everyday Americans" and differentiate herself from Trump, who she claims doesn't understand "working families." This explicitly positions her as authentic.
    *   **Salience:** 0.7 - The personal story is a key rhetorical device used early in the speech to build ethos.
    *   **Evidence:** "This is personal for me. I am the product of the American middle class, I was born in Chicago, I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for 50 years." and "I’m the daughter of a small-business owner and the grand-daughter of a factory worker – and proud of both."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.9

*   **homogeneous_people_construction:**
    *   **Score:** 0.5 (Medium) - She frequently uses "we" and "us" (e.g., "we are all in this together," "We are stronger together") to construct a unified American identity, emphasizing shared goals and resilience. She aims to transcend divisions by focusing on common economic interests, but it doesn't explicitly erase class/regional/interest divisions.
    *   **Salience:** 0.6 - "Together" is a frequent keyword and concept.
    *   **Evidence:** "If we do it together, we can all rise together. Because, you know what I like to say, we are stronger together, and that’s why the fourth question is key."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.8

*   **nationalist_exclusion:**
    *   **Score:** 0.3 (Low) - She promotes American strength and competitiveness ("It's probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us!"), but this is framed economically rather than culturally or ethnically exclusive. She contrasts American economic prowess with other countries in terms of clean energy jobs, not cultural purity. She mentions "deporting millions of hard-working immigrants" as a *negative* of Trump's plan.
    *   **Salience:** 0.2 - Not a dominant theme.
    *   **Evidence:** "Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It’s probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us!"
    *   **Confidence:** 0.7

*   **economic_populist_appeals:**
    *   **Score:** 0.9 (High) - The entire speech is an economic populist appeal. She frames economic issues as a conflict between "working families" and "the top," "Wall Street," "corporations," promising to make the economy work for "everyone" and addressing "inequality." She attacks Trump's economic plans as beneficial only to the rich. This aligns perfectly with the definition.
    *   **Salience:** 1.0 - This is the central, overarching theme of the speech.
    *   **Evidence:** "My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top." and "Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich, should finally pay their fair share of taxes."
    *   **Confidence:** 1.0

---
**Approach 2: Context-Weighted Analysis**

*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing:**
    *   **Score:** 0.7 (Medium-High) - The speech is structured around a clear dichotomy between Clinton's vision (for the many) and Trump's vision (for the few). Her persistent contrast with Trump, especially on economic policy and tax plans, reinforces this "us vs. them" moral framing. The rhetorical context places her as the champion of "working families" against an elite (Trump, Wall Street, corporations).
    *   **Salience:** 0.8 - This framing underpins much of her policy discussion and attacks on Trump. It's a foundational rhetorical strategy.
    *   **Evidence:** "My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top." and "Donald Trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself. I want to invest it in veterans, our kids, our police officers, and so much more."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.9

*   **crisis_restoration_narrative:**
    *   **Score:** 0.6 (Medium) - The speech acknowledges significant economic challenges ("too much inequality," "it's just too hard to get ahead") that are framed as requiring urgent action, implying a "crisis." Her proposed policies are presented as "restoring" opportunity and a "basic bargain" that has been lost. The Detroit example (Midtown and Eastern Market "coming back") serves as a micro-narrative of restoration.
    *   **Salience:** 0.7 - The narrative of decline and promised restoration of economic opportunity is a central thread that justifies her policy proposals.
    *   **Evidence:** "Those challenges emerged long before the Great Recession, and they have persisted through our recovery. There is too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today." and "So here’s what I want. I want every American family to be able to tell the same story. If you work hard, you do your part, you should be able to give your children all the opportunities they deserve. That is the basic bargain of America."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.9

*   **popular_sovereignty_claims:**
    *   **Score:** 0.3 (Low) - While she frequently refers to "the American people" and what *they* want or need, this is primarily in the context of being responsive to public needs or empowering individuals through policies, not asserting direct popular will bypassing institutions. Her emphasis is on delivering results *through* government action and collaboration ("work with both parties").
    *   **Salience:** 0.2 - "The people" are the beneficiaries, not the direct political actor.
    *   **Evidence:** "I want you to have a say in your government." (Empowerment, not direct sovereignty)
    *   **Confidence:** 0.8

*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion:**
    *   **Score:** 0.1 (Absent-Minimal) - This dimension is very low. Clinton explicitly calls for unity and working across the aisle ("It’s how we created the Children’s Health Insurance Program," "get everyone at the table"). She critiques Trump's *ideas* and *character* ("insults and bullying") but not the legitimacy of political opposition itself. Her rhetoric actively counters anti-pluralism.
    *   **Salience:** 0.0 - Not present as a strategy.
    *   **Evidence:** "I know it’s hard to imagine, but there was a time when Democrats and Republicans actually worked together." (Positive framing of pluralism).
    *   **Confidence:** 0.9

*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption:**
    *   **Score:** 0.5 (Medium) - She states "powerful special interests... have led to gridlock in Congress" and describes corporate outsourcing as deliberately structured ("corporations should not abandon profitable operations here in the United States to move abroad, just to give shareholders a quicker return, CEOs a bigger bonus"). This hints at systemic issues and coordination among elites for self-interest, though not a full-blown "conspiracy."
    *   **Salience:** 0.6 - This accusation against "special interests" and "Wall Street" is a recurring rhetorical tactic to justify her economic plans.
    *   **Evidence:** "Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress." and "Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich, should finally pay their fair share of taxes."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.8

*   **authenticity_vs_political_class:**
    *   **Score:** 0.8 (High) - Her lengthy personal anecdote about her working-class background and family history, contrasted with Trump's business practices (stiffing small businesses), is a central rhetorical strategy to establish her as "one of us" and distinguish herself from the "political class" or "wealthy elite." The "product of the American middle class" phrasing directly signals authenticity.
    *   **Salience:** 0.8 - Positioned prominently early in the speech and revisited when attacking Trump, this theme is highly central.
    *   **Evidence:** "This is personal for me. I am the product of the American middle class, I was born in Chicago, I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for 50 years." and "I’m the daughter of a small-business owner and the grand-daughter of a factory worker – and proud of both."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.9

*   **homogeneous_people_construction:**
    *   **Score:** 0.6 (Medium-High) - The repeated refrain "We are stronger together," and emphasis on "working together" to achieve national goals, creates a strong sense of a unified, collective "American people." She includes different groups ("Democrats," "Republicans," "Independents," "business," "labor unions," "academics," "experts") under this umbrella, transcending internal political divisions by focusing on shared values and economic prosperity.
    *   **Salience:** 0.7 - "Together" is a consistent theme, especially towards the end, serving as a unifying call to action.
    *   **Evidence:** "If we can grow together, we can all rise together. Because, you know what I like to say, we are stronger together, and that’s why the fourth question is key." and "We are resilient, determined, hard-working. There is nothing America can’t do – if we do it together."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.9

*   **nationalist_exclusion:**
    *   **Score:** 0.2 (Minimal) - While she emphasizes American strength and competitiveness ("America isn’t afraid to compete"), this is within an economic framework, not a cultural exclusionary one. Her criticism of China is about unfair trade practices, not inherent cultural inferiority. She rejects Trump's "hide behind walls" approach, signaling an anti-exclusionary stance on immigration (by mentioning "deporting millions of hard-working immigrants" as negative).
    *   **Salience:** 0.1 - Very peripheral.
    *   **Evidence:** "Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It’s probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us!"
    *   **Confidence:** 0.8

*   **economic_populist_appeals:**
    *   **Score:** 0.9 (High) - The entire speech is an extended economic argument framed through a populist lens. The central conflict is economic inequality and the fight for "working families" against corporate greed and the wealthy elite. Her policy proposals are all framed as benefiting the "many" over the "few." This is the core message of the speech, strategically placed at the beginning and end, and woven throughout the comparisons with Trump.
    *   **Salience:** 1.0 - The most salient dimension, the speech is fundamentally an economic populist appeal.
    *   **Evidence:** "My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top." and "Donald Trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself. I want to invest it in veterans, our kids, our police officers, and so much more."
    *   **Confidence:** 1.0

---
**Approach 3: Pattern-Based Analysis**

*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing:**
    *   **Score:** 0.7 (Medium-High) - The "everyone vs. those at the top" framing is highly repetitive, appearing in her opening statement of purpose ("make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top"), throughout her critique of Trump's tax plan, and in her closing remarks. The consistent contrast with Trump's "trickle-down" ideas reinforces this binary.
    *   **Salience:** 0.8 - The "us vs. them" (working families vs. the rich/special interests) is a recurring motif that structures the entire speech.
    *   **Evidence:** "My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top." and "Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich, should finally pay their fair share of taxes." (Repeated calls for fair share).
    *   **Confidence:** 0.9

*   **crisis_restoration_narrative:**
    *   **Score:** 0.5 (Medium) - The pattern is "problem-solution." She repeatedly highlights economic problems ("too much inequality," "jobs disappearing," "factories closed") and contrasts them with promises of "restoration" ("comeback," "build the future," "get back to building"). The phrase "make America great again" (from Trump, but implicitly countered) suggests a decline, and her agenda is the restoration.
    *   **Salience:** 0.6 - This narrative arc (identifying problems, offering solutions) structures many of her policy points.
    *   **Evidence:** "There is too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today." (Problem repetition) and "We are builders and we need to get back to building!" (Restoration call).
    *   **Confidence:** 0.8

*   **popular_sovereignty_claims:**
    *   **Score:** 0.2 (Minimal) - Her appeals to "the American people" are consistently as beneficiaries or voters, not as an unmediated sovereign body. The rhetorical pattern is about *serving* the people, not direct rule by them.
    *   **Salience:** 0.1 - Minimal. The pattern is about policy, not direct popular mandate.
    *   **Evidence:** "I want every American family to be able to tell the same story." (Focus on individual benefit, not collective will as ultimate authority).
    *   **Confidence:** 0.7

*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion:**
    *   **Score:** 0.1 (Absent-Minimal) - The rhetorical pattern is one of contrast with Trump's *policies* and *character*, not a rejection of political opposition itself. She advocates for bipartisan work and getting "everyone at the table," which is contrary to anti-pluralism.
    *   **Salience:** 0.0 - No significant pattern of exclusion.
    *   **Evidence:** "I just don’t think insults and bullying is how we’re going to get things done." (Rejects means, not legitimacy of opponent).
    *   **Confidence:** 0.9

*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption:**
    *   **Score:** 0.4 (Low-Medium) - She uses phrases like "powerful special interests" and "lobbying for trade deals" that imply systematic influence. Her father's story and Trump's business practices are used as illustrative anecdotes of "the little guy" being taken advantage of by "the top." This repetitive pattern hints at a system rigged by elites.
    *   **Salience:** 0.5 - This is a recurrent explanatory framework for economic problems.
    *   **Evidence:** "Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress." and "Too many companies lobbied for trade deals so they could sell products abroad but then they instead moved abroad and sold back into the United States."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.7

*   **authenticity_vs_political_class:**
    *   **Score:** 0.8 (High) - The extensive personal narrative about her middle-class upbringing, factory worker grandfather, and small business owner father is a primary rhetorical pattern to establish her "authenticity." This is directly contrasted with Trump's elite status and business practices (stiffing small businesses), creating a powerful "us vs. him" authenticity dynamic.
    *   **Salience:** 0.8 - The personal story is heavily emphasized early on and directly linked to her policy motivations.
    *   **Evidence:** "This is personal for me. I am the product of the American middle class, I was born in Chicago, I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for 50 years." and "I’m the daughter of a small-business owner and the grand-daughter of a factory worker – and proud of both." (Repetitive self-identification).
    *   **Confidence:** 0.9

*   **homogeneous_people_construction:**
    *   **Score:** 0.6 (Medium-High) - The repeated phrase "we are stronger together" serves as a powerful unifying slogan. She uses "we" frequently to refer to all Americans, emphasizing shared destiny and collective action ("if we do it together, we can all rise together"). This pattern of collective identity transcends potential internal divisions.
    *   **Salience:** 0.7 - "Together" is a highly repeated word, signaling unity and collective identity as a central theme.
    *   **Evidence:** "We are resilient, determined, hard-working. There is nothing America can’t do – if we do it together." and "If we can grow together, we can all rise together. Because, you know what I like to say, we are stronger together, and that’s why the fourth question is key."
    *   **Confidence:** 0.9

*   **nationalist_exclusion:**
    *   **Score:** 0.3 (Low) - The speech highlights American exceptionalism and desire to lead economically ("I want it to be us! We invent the technology, we should make it and use it and export it"), but this is a pattern of economic nationalism, not cultural exclusion. Her critique of Trump's "hide behind walls" also actively rejects a common nationalist-exclusionary pattern.
    *   **Salience:** 0.2 - Not a dominant pattern, economic focus.
    *   **Evidence:** "Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It’s probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us!"
    *   **Confidence:** 0.7

*   **economic_populist_appeals:**
    *   **Score:** 0.9 (High) - This is the dominant and most consistent pattern. The speech is built on economic policy proposals framed as benefiting the working class and small businesses, while consistently attacking Trump's plans as enriching the wealthy. Phrases like "work for everyone, not just those at the top," "fair share," "economic justice" are repeated and central to nearly every argument.
    *   **Salience:** 1.0 - The most pervasive rhetorical pattern, defining the speech's core message.
    *   **Evidence:** "My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top." and "So many Americans have the talent and the will to succeed — whether they’re kids right out of high school or older people displaced by automation and outsourcing."
    *   **Confidence:** 1.0

**Best Evidence Selection (based on highest confidence or most representative):**

*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing:** "My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top." (From Approach 1 and 3, very representative)
*   **crisis_restoration_narrative:** "Those challenges emerged long before the Great Recession, and they have persisted through our recovery. There is too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today." (From Approach 2, captures the problem framing well)
*   **popular_sovereignty_claims:** "I want you to have a say in your government." (From Approach 2, most indicative of limited popular sovereignty claims)
*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion:** "I know it’s hard to imagine, but there was a time when Democrats and Republicans actually worked together." (From Approach 2, directly shows anti-anti-pluralist stance)
*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption:** "Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress." (From Approach 2, clearly states specific groups are the cause of systemic issues)
*   **authenticity_vs_political_class:** "This is personal for me. I am the product of the American middle class, I was born in Chicago, I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for 50 years." (From Approach 3, strong personal anecdote)
*   **homogeneous_people_construction:** "We are resilient, determined, hard-working. There is nothing America can’t do – if we do it together." (From Approach 3, encapsulates the unity and collective strength)
*   **nationalist_exclusion:** "Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It’s probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us!" (From Approach 3, clearly defines the economic rather than cultural competition)
*   **economic_populist_appeals:** "My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top." (From Approach 1, concise and directly related to the definition)

Confidence for evidence quotes is generally high given the directness of the quotes to the dimensions. I'll use 0.9 or 1.0 for the evidence confidence.
For context type, I will use "direct statement", "thematic framing", or "rhetorical positioning".
