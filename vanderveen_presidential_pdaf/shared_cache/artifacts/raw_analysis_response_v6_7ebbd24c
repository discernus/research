It consistently draws a Manichaean distinction between Trump's 'hate groups' and a unified 'Americans' under a crisis-restoration narrative. There is minimal to no presence of populist claims concerning popular sovereignty, authenticity vs. political class, or economic populist appeals from Clinton's perspective, as she positions herself as a defender of established democratic norms and inclusive values.",
