I'll analyze the Trump speech using three independent analytical approaches, then aggregate the results.

## APPROACH 1: Evidence-First Analysis
Focusing on direct textual evidence and explicit statements.

**Manichean People-Elite Framing (0.9)**: Clear moral dichotomy throughout - "corrupt political establishment" vs "American People," "failed and corrupt political establishment" vs "new government controlled by you." Direct corruption attributions: "The Clintons are criminals."

**Crisis-Restoration Narrative (0.8)**: Strong decline narrative - "crossroads in the history of our civilization," "struggle for the survival of our nation." Restoration promises: "take back our country," "Make America Great Again."

**Popular Sovereignty Claims (0.7)**: "We The People reclaim control over our government," "American people would rise above it," positioning people's will as ultimate authority.

**Anti-Pluralist Exclusion (0.6)**: Characterizes opposition as existential threat - "Clinton Machine" as criminal enterprise, media as "political special interest."

**Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption (0.9)**: Extensive conspiracy claims - "global power structure," "Clinton Machine meets in secret with international banks," coordinated media corruption.

**Authenticity vs Political Class (0.8)**: Strong outsider positioning - "I was an insider...now I am being punished for leaving their special club," "I'm the only one who can fix it."

**Homogeneous People Construction (0.7)**: Unified people identity - "our movement," "all of us, together, as a country," transcending internal divisions.

**Nationalist Exclusion (0.5)**: Some external threat emphasis - "global special interests," "globalization," but limited cultural/ethnic framing.

**Economic Populist Appeals (0.8)**: Strong economic elite framing - "global power structure" robbing working class, "handful of large corporations."

## APPROACH 2: Context-Weighted Analysis
Emphasizing rhetorical positioning and thematic centrality.

**Manichean People-Elite Framing (0.8)**: Central organizing theme of speech, repeated throughout with high rhetorical emphasis.

**Crisis-Restoration Narrative (0.9)**: Opening theme of "crossroads," maintains urgency throughout, closes with restoration promise.

**Popular Sovereignty Claims (0.8)**: Structurally positioned as core democratic claim, repeated emphasis on people's ultimate authority.

**Anti-Pluralist Exclusion (0.7)**: Systematic delegitimization of opposition throughout, framed as illegitimate.

**Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption (0.8)**: Detailed elaboration of coordinated elite action, central to argument structure.

**Authenticity vs Political Class (0.7)**: Important positioning but secondary to other themes.

**Homogeneous People Construction (0.6)**: Present but less emphasized than elite opposition framing.

**Nationalist Exclusion (0.4)**: Limited emphasis on cultural boundaries, more focused on economic themes.

**Economic Populist Appeals (0.7)**: Significant theme but integrated with broader elite conspiracy narrative.

## APPROACH 3: Pattern-Based Analysis
Looking for repetition patterns and strategic emphasis.

**Manichean People-Elite Framing (0.9)**: Repeated "establishment" vs "people" throughout, consistent moral framing pattern.

**Crisis-Restoration Narrative (0.8)**: "Crossroads" metaphor, repeated crisis language, restoration promises pattern.

**Popular Sovereignty Claims (0.6)**: Multiple instances but less repetitive than other dimensions.

**Anti-Pluralist Exclusion (0.8)**: Consistent pattern of opposition delegitimization, repeated "Clinton Machine" references.

**Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption (0.9)**: Extensive elaboration pattern, detailed conspiracy claims repeated.

**Authenticity vs Political Class (0.9)**: Strong insider/outsider pattern, repeated positioning.

**Homogeneous People Construction (0.8)**: "Our movement," "together," unity language patterns.

**Nationalist Exclusion (0.6)**: Some global threat patterns but less emphasized.

**Economic Populist Appeals (0.9)**: Strong working class vs elite patterns, repeated economic framing.
