Each analysis should score all nine dimensions (intensity, salience, confidence) and provide textual evidence.\n    *   **Approach 1: \"Evidence-First Analysis\"**: Prioritize explicit statements and clear indicators.\n    *   **Approach 2: \"Context-Weighted Analysis\"**: Emphasize rhetorical context, structural positioning, and thematic centrality.\n    *   **Approach 3: \"Pattern-Based Analysis\"**: Look for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis.\n3.  **Aggregate the results:**\n    *   Calculate the **median** raw_score and salience for each dimension across the three approaches.\n    *   Select the **best evidence quote** for each dimension from the three approaches (highest confidence or most representative).\n    *   The confidence score for the aggregated result will be the average of the confidence scores from the three approaches for that dimension. (No, the prompt says confidence is `[0.0-1.0 scoring confidence]` for the final aggregated result, suggesting an overall confidence in the *scoring* of that dimension, which is typically derived from the average or median of the individual approach confidences. Let's use the median for consistency with raw_score and salience, or average for general overall confidence. The prompt explicitly says `[MEDIAN of 3 approaches - 0.0-1.0 rhetorical prominence]` for salience, and `[MEDIAN of 3 approaches - 0.0-1.0 dimensional intensity]` for raw score. For confidence, it just says `[0.0-1.0 scoring confidence]`. I will use median for confidence too, to align with the other median calculations.)\n4.  **Format the output as a JSON** string precisely as specified, including the delimiters.\n\n**Framework Details (from decoded base64):**\n\n*   **Framework Name:** populist_discourse_analysis_framework\n*   **Framework Version:** 10.0.0\n*   **Dimensions:**\n    1.  **manichaean_people_elite_framing**: Moral dichotomy between pure, virtuous people and corrupt, self-serving elites.\n    2.  **crisis_restoration_narrative**: Decline-crisis-redemption temporal structuring where current crisis stems from elite betrayal.\n    3.  **popular_sovereignty_claims**: Direct people's will as ultimate political authority, bypassing representative institutions.\n    4.  **anti_pluralist_exclusion**: Rejection of legitimate opposition and institutional constraints on popular will.\n    5.  **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption**: Elite coordination against people's interests through hidden networks or institutional capture.\n    6.  **authenticity_vs_political_class**: Genuine representation vs. professional politician artifice.\n    7.  **homogeneous_people_construction**: Unified people identity transcending internal divisions (class, region, interest).\n    8.  **nationalist_exclusion**: Cultural/ethnic homogeneity and external threat emphasis defining populist community boundaries.\n    9.  **economic_populist_appeals**: Populist economic discourse regardless of ideological direction (redistributive left vs. protectionist right).\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n*   0.0-1.0 scale for intensity (raw_score), salience, and confidence.\n*   `raw_score`: Strength of evidence.\n*   `salience`: Rhetorical prominence (frequency, structural position, thematic centrality, rhetorical devices).\n*   `confidence`: Certainty of assessment.\n*   Specific textual evidence required.\n\nLet's break down the document and apply each approach independently.\n\n---\n**Document 1: trump/primary_season/trump_2016_03_15.txt**\nThis is a speech by Donald Trump after winning primaries in Florida, Illinois, and North Carolina in March 2016.\n\n**Initial Read-through & Keyword Spotting:**\n*   \"Thank you.

As a country, we don\u2019t win anymore.\" (Framing economic issues in terms of national failure and the need for new leadership). \"We\u2019re going to make our country rich again.\" (Promise of economic restoration).\n    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Dominant theme, linking economic issues to elite incompetence and national decline.)\n    *   salience: 0.9 (Highly central to the entire speech and his platform.)\n    *   confidence: 1.0 (Extremely confident, this is pervasive.)\n\n---\n**Approach 2: Context-Weighted Analysis**\n\nEmphasize rhetorical context, structural positioning, and thematic centrality.\n\n*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**: The speech opens with celebration, but quickly pivots to framing negative media commentary and \"incompetence at the highest level\" as obstacles. This adversarial framing recurs structurally, especially when discussing \"disgusting reporters\" at the end. The implied opposition of the \"people\" (voters) vs. \"these people\" (critics/politicians) is central.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Less about explicit moral condemnation, more about framing \"them\" as incompetent obstacles to \"us\".)\n    *   salience: 0.9 (The \"us vs. them\" framing provides a pervasive undercurrent, structuring many of his arguments.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (The consistent contrast permeates the speech's message.)\n\n*   **crisis_restoration_narrative**: This narrative is the backbone of the speech's justification for Trump's campaign. He starts by noting national decline (\"companies are leaving,\" \"we don't win anymore\") and uses specific events (Paris, LA shooting) as evidence of a deeper crisis (\"took on a whole new meaning\"). The constant repetition of \"we're going to win again,\" \"make our country great again,\" etc., especially at the end, structurally reinforces the restoration promise.\n    *   raw_score: 0.9 (The crisis is presented as severe and widespread.)\n    *   salience: 1.0 (It's the overarching rhetorical strategy, giving purpose to his campaign and policy promises.)\n    *   confidence: 1.0 (Absolutely central and pervasive.)\n\n*   **popular_sovereignty_claims**: His discussion of polling booth lines and \"people that never voted before\" is positioned as key evidence of a new, direct popular mandate, contrasting with the \"ridiculous\" old political math. This emphasis on mass mobilization (\"millions of people are coming in to vote\") is thematically central to his claim of legitimacy and power.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong claims of popular authority through direct voter action.)\n    *   salience: 0.8 (High prominence, structurally highlighted by anecdotes about long lines and new voters.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Clear contextual emphasis.)\n\n*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion**: The dismissal of negative advertising as \"mostly false, vicious, horrible\" and his inability to \"understand\" why his numbers went up despite it, is a rhetorical move to delegitimize any opposition. By framing critics as \"disgusting reporters, horrible people,\" he seeks to exclude their views from legitimate political discourse. This is thematically consistent with his \"winning\" narrative.\n    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Delegitimization is present but slightly less explicit than in Approach 1.)\n    *   salience: 0.7 (This delegitimization of opposition, particularly media, features prominently in several segments.)\n    *   confidence: 0.8 (The strategic dismissal of criticism is clear.)\n\n*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption**: While not explicitly using the word \"conspiracy,\" the framing of negative ads as a coordinated, well-funded, \"brutal\" campaign \"in waves one after another\" against him suggests a systemic, almost conspiratorial effort by \"them.\" This forms a thematic counter-narrative to his own popular surge, implying that \"they\" (unnamed forces) are working against the popular will.\n    *   raw_score: 0.7 (The systemic nature is strongly implied through the description of the attacks.)\n    *   salience: 0.7 (The extensive description of the negative ads gives this theme significant prominence, especially the anecdotes about the Doral golf tournament.)\n    *   confidence: 0.8 (The context strongly points to perceived coordinated action.)\n\n*   **authenticity_vs_political_class**: Trump positions himself as a deal-maker and someone who understands \"basic physics\" and \"mathematics\" when \"these people\" (politicians/media) don't. His personal anecdotes (family, Mar-a-Lago, \"came down the escalator\") are used to present a relatable, non-political persona. This contrasts implicitly with the \"gross incompetence at the highest level\" he attributes to traditional politicians. This self-presentation is pervasive.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Consistent self-framing as an authentic outsider.)\n    *   salience: 0.8 (Pervasive, intertwined with his criticism of elites and claims of competence.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Strong rhetorical strategy.)\n\n*   **homogeneous_people_construction**: The repeated anecdotes about massive voter turnout, including Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters, serves to construct a broad, undifferentiated \"people\" united by a desire for change. This rhetorical construction simplifies complex demographics into a single, powerful \"will of the people.\" Thematic centrality is high in reinforcing his mandate.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on unifying elements.)\n    *   salience: 0.7 (The stories of voter turnout are a key part of his victory narrative.)\n    *   confidence: 0.8 (Clear and consistently used.)\n\n*   **nationalist_exclusion**: The focus on \"borders,\" \"companies leaving our country,\" and \"we don't win anymore\" against specific foreign entities (China, Vietnam, Japan, Mexico, India) are structurally central to his policy positions. This rhetorical strategy clearly defines an in-group (USA/Americans) and an out-group (foreign competitors/threats), justifying protectionist and nationalistic policies.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong and explicit nationalist framing.)\n    *   salience: 0.8 (Central to his argument for economic change and national security.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Highly apparent.)\n\n*   **economic_populist_appeals**: This is perhaps the most contextually central theme. The \"crisis\" he identifies (companies leaving, bad trade deals) is primarily economic, and his \"restoration\" promises (making companies stay, good deals, \"make our country rich again\") are also economic. He consistently blames the current economic decline on the incompetence of the political establishment.\n    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Economic issues are presented as fundamental problems requiring populist solutions.)\n    *   salience: 1.0 (The entire rationale for his candidacy and vision is deeply rooted in economic grievances and proposed solutions.)\n    *   confidence: 1.0 (Pervasive and undeniably central.)\n\n---\n**Approach 3: Pattern-Based Analysis**\n\nLook for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis.\n\n*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**: Repetition of phrases like \"gross incompetence at the highest level,\" \"ridiculous,\" \"disgusting reporters, horrible people.\" Use of personal anecdotes to highlight difference: \"I have to explain to these people they don\u2019t understand...\" This pattern of dismissing opponents' intellect or morality recurs.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Consistent verbal attacks on elites.)\n    *   salience: 0.8 (The recurring insults and framing of critics as \"horrible\" or \"disgusting\" makes this highly salient.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Strong patterns of elite-blaming.)\n\n*   **crisis_restoration_narrative**: Heavy repetition of \"we don't win anymore\" (at least 4 times), \"make our country great again,\" \"start winning again.\" The narrative structure consistently moves from current failures (companies leaving, bad deals, weak military, neglected veterans, \"disasters\" like Paris) to future victory through his leadership. This cyclical pattern is a core rhetorical device.\n    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Repeated phrases and narrative structure confirm the intensity.)\n    *   salience: 1.0 (The most pronounced rhetorical pattern, central to the speech's message.)\n    *   confidence: 1.0 (Undeniable pattern.)\n\n*   **popular_sovereignty_claims**: Emphasis through vivid descriptions and numerical claims: \"Millions of people are coming in to vote,\" \"lines are four, five, six blocks long,\" \"people that never voted before.\" The \"53%\" poll anecdote is used to reframe traditional political analysis, asserting popular will as supreme. This pattern emphasizes popular uprising over institutional process.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on quantity and impact of popular support.)\n    *   salience: 0.7 (The concrete examples of voter turnout serve to highlight this.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Clear rhetorical patterns reinforce this.)\n\n*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion**: Repetition of \"vicious,\" \"horrible,\" \"mostly false\" to describe negative advertising and \"disgusting reporters.\" The rhetorical effect is to systematically invalidate dissenting voices or opposition tactics. The phrase \"What a disaster\" is applied to political attacks, equating opposition with catastrophe.\n    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Use of strong negative adjectives to describe opposition.)\n    *   salience: 0.6 (Prominent in his responses to criticism, creating a pattern of dismissal.)\n    *   confidence: 0.7 (The patterned dismissal is clear.)\n\n*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption**: The repeated descriptions of negative ads coming \"in waves one after another after another\" and being \"brutal\" and \"disaster\" creates a pattern of an overwhelming, coordinated, and illegitimate attack. While not explicitly naming a conspiracy, the consistent framing implies a concerted effort by \"them.\"\n    *   raw_score: 0.6 (Implied through consistent negative framing of opposition activities.)\n    *   salience: 0.6 (The extended anecdote about the negative ads and the golf tournament highlights this patterned attack.)\n    *   confidence: 0.7 (Pattern of describing organized, negative campaigns.)\n\n*   **authenticity_vs_political_class**: Self-referential statements like \"I'm working very hard,\" \"I'm not a politician,\" and focusing on his business background. Contrasting his ability to \"make a deal in 10 minutes\" with politicians who \"can't get along\" is a repeated rhetorical juxtaposition. The frequent use of \"I\" when talking about solutions positions him as the unique, authentic actor.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Consistent self-presentation as an authentic outsider.)\n    *   salience: 0.7 (Pervasive through personal anecdotes and direct comparisons.)\n    *   confidence: 0.8 (Clear rhetorical positioning.)\n\n*   **homogeneous_people_construction**: The inclusive language when describing voters (\"Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and... people that never voted before\") creates a unified image of \"the people.\" The collective \"we\" (\"We have so, so many great people\") reinforces this homogeneity, emphasizing shared identity over division.\n    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Consistent use of inclusive and unifying language for his supporters.)\n    *   salience: 0.6 (The descriptions of voter turnout provide strong examples.)\n    *   confidence: 0.7 (Clear patterns of unifying language.)\n\n*   **nationalist_exclusion**: Repetition of \"in the United States, not in China, Vietnam...\" and listing multiple countries (\"China, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India\"). The recurring theme of \"borders\" and \"protection in our country\" defines the in-group (\"our country\") against foreign out-groups. The \"we don't win anymore\" applies specifically to international relations.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong, consistent pattern of identifying foreign threats and emphasizing national protection.)\n    *   salience: 0.8 (Highly repetitive and central to his policy arguments.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Clear and consistent pattern.)\n\n*   **economic_populist_appeals**: High frequency of economic terms (\"companies leaving,\" \"trade deals,\" \"taxes,\" \"money back into the country,\" \"rich again\"). The repeated phrases \"we don't win anymore\" and \"make our country rich again\" are directly tied to economic grievances and solutions, forming a dominant rhetorical pattern.\n    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Very high frequency of economic themes.)\n    *   salience: 1.0 (The most frequent and dominant rhetorical pattern throughout the speech.)\n    *   confidence: 1.0 (Pervasive and undeniable.)\n\n---\n**Summary of Scores per Approach:**\n\n**Dimension Scores:**\n\n| Dimension                             | Approach 1 (Evidence-First) | Approach 2 (Context-Weighted) | Approach 3 (Pattern-Based) |\n| :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------- |\n| **manichaean_people_elite_framing**   | R: 0.9, S: 0.8, C: 0.9      | R: 0.8, S: 0.9, C: 0.9        | R: 0.8, S: 0.8, C: 0.9      |\n| **crisis_restoration_narrative**      | R: 0.9, S: 0.9, C: 1.0      | R: 0.9, S: 1.0, C: 1.0        | R: 0.9, S: 1.0, C: 1.0      |\n| **popular_sovereignty_claims**        | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.9      | R: 0.8, S: 0.8, C: 0.9        | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.9      |\n| **anti_pluralist_exclusion**          | R: 0.7, S: 0.6, C: 0.8      | R: 0.7, S: 0.7, C: 0.8        | R: 0.7, S: 0.6, C: 0.7      |\n| **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption** | R: 0.7, S: 0.6, C: 0.7      | R: 0.7, S: 0.7, C: 0.8        | R: 0.6, S: 0.6, C: 0.7      |\n| **authenticity_vs_political_class**   | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.8      | R: 0.8, S: 0.8, C: 0.9        | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.8      |\n| **homogeneous_people_construction**   | R: 0.7, S: 0.6, C: 0.8      | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.8        | R: 0.7, S: 0.6, C: 0.7      |\n| **nationalist_exclusion**             | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.9      | R: 0.8, S: 0.8, C: 0.9        | R: 0.8, S: 0.8, C: 0.9      |\n| **economic_populist_appeals**         | R: 0.9, S: 0.9, C: 1.0      | R: 0.9, S: 1.0, C: 1.0        | R: 0.9, S: 1.0, C: 1.0      |\n\n---\n**Calculate Medians and Select Best Evidence:**\n\nFor each dimension, list the scores from the three approaches (R, S, C) and pick the median.
