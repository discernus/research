<ctrl94>thought
The user wants me to perform a discourse analysis on a given document using a specific framework.
I need to:
1.  **Decode the base64 encoded framework and document.**
2.  **Perform three *independent* analyses** on the document. Each analysis should score all nine dimensions (intensity, salience, confidence) and provide textual evidence.
    *   **Approach 1: "Evidence-First Analysis"**: Prioritize explicit statements and clear indicators.
    *   **Approach 2: "Context-Weighted Analysis"**: Emphasize rhetorical context, structural positioning, and thematic centrality.
    *   **Approach 3: "Pattern-Based Analysis"**: Look for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis.
3.  **Aggregate the results:**
    *   Calculate the **median** raw_score and salience for each dimension across the three approaches.
    *   Select the **best evidence quote** for each dimension from the three approaches (highest confidence or most representative).
    *   The confidence score for the aggregated result will be the average of the confidence scores from the three approaches for that dimension. (No, the prompt says confidence is `[0.0-1.0 scoring confidence]` for the final aggregated result, suggesting an overall confidence in the *scoring* of that dimension, which is typically derived from the average or median of the individual approach confidences. Let's use the median for consistency with raw_score and salience, or average for general overall confidence. The prompt explicitly says `[MEDIAN of 3 approaches - 0.0-1.0 rhetorical prominence]` for salience, and `[MEDIAN of 3 approaches - 0.0-1.0 dimensional intensity]` for raw score. For confidence, it just says `[0.0-1.0 scoring confidence]`. I will use median for confidence too, to align with the other median calculations.)
4.  **Format the output as a JSON** string precisely as specified, including the delimiters.

**Framework Details (from decoded base64):**

*   **Framework Name:** populist_discourse_analysis_framework
*   **Framework Version:** 10.0.0
*   **Dimensions:**
    1.  **manichaean_people_elite_framing**: Moral dichotomy between pure, virtuous people and corrupt, self-serving elites.
    2.  **crisis_restoration_narrative**: Decline-crisis-redemption temporal structuring where current crisis stems from elite betrayal.
    3.  **popular_sovereignty_claims**: Direct people's will as ultimate political authority, bypassing representative institutions.
    4.  **anti_pluralist_exclusion**: Rejection of legitimate opposition and institutional constraints on popular will.
    5.  **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption**: Elite coordination against people's interests through hidden networks or institutional capture.
    6.  **authenticity_vs_political_class**: Genuine representation vs. professional politician artifice.
    7.  **homogeneous_people_construction**: Unified people identity transcending internal divisions (class, region, interest).
    8.  **nationalist_exclusion**: Cultural/ethnic homogeneity and external threat emphasis defining populist community boundaries.
    9.  **economic_populist_appeals**: Populist economic discourse regardless of ideological direction (redistributive left vs. protectionist right).

**Scoring Guidelines:**
*   0.0-1.0 scale for intensity (raw_score), salience, and confidence.
*   `raw_score`: Strength of evidence.
*   `salience`: Rhetorical prominence (frequency, structural position, thematic centrality, rhetorical devices).
*   `confidence`: Certainty of assessment.
*   Specific textual evidence required.

Let's break down the document and apply each approach independently.

**Document 1: trump/primary_season/trump_2016_03_15.txt**
This is a speech by Donald Trump after winning primaries in Florida, Illinois, and North Carolina in March 2016.

**Initial Read-through & Keyword Spotting:**
*   "Thank you. Thank you! Thank you very much everybody. This was an amazing evening. This was a great evening." - (Positive, celebratory)
*   "I heard very early in the morning — nine delegates. That’s a lot. And I just wanted to thank the governor, Ralph Torres, great guy, Chairman [James] Ada who was a fantastic man and that was a very nice start to the day. That I can tell you." - (Gratitude, name-dropping, positive framing of supporters)
*    "CNN was very nice. They came up with a poll. The poll said 49% to 14% and 15%."
*   "But Donald Trump doesn’t get over 50% because I’m at 43%, 45%. Actually now according to The Economist, I’m at 53%." - (Addressing critics, framing himself as exceeding expectations despite "rules", attacking media/analysts for not understanding) -> **manichaean, popular sovereignty**
*   "And I have to explain to these people they don’t understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it." - (Elites/critics are incompetent/misinformed) -> **manichaean**
*   "When I don’t get over 50%, we have four people. Right? We have four people. Do you understand that? So when I get 53% — and this one is an example, I had 53% and that’s with four people. That’s an achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50%. So someday, someday they’re going to understand, someday when we take it all, they’ll understand." - (Framing electoral success as a mandate, implying that detractors will eventually be proven wrong) -> **popular sovereignty**
*   "But it is really ridiculous." - (Criticism of the system/opponents)
*   "I want to thank my family." - (Personal touch)
*   "Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China, Vietnam and all of – And we’re not going to be losing our companies. You know, our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly, whether it’s Carrier air conditioning, whether it’s Ford, whether it’s Eaton. I was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp. they’re leaving and so many companies are leaving. And frankly, I’m disgusted with it and I’m tired of seeing it and there’s no reason for it. It’s just gross incompetence at the highest level." - (Companies leaving, criticism of leadership, "gross incompetence", "disgusted", "tired") -> **crisis_restoration, economic_populist, manichaean (incompetence of elites)**
*   "We should not allow it to happen. Pfzier, great company, pharmaceutical company, they’re going to Ireland. And there’s so many more. You have corporate inversions. You have people who can’t get their money back into the country because the politicians can’t get along. They can’t make a deal." - (More examples of economic crisis, blaming politicians for incompetence/gridlock) -> **crisis_restoration, elite_conspiracy (implied, "can't get along" leading to systemic issue), manichaean (politicians are incompetent)**
*   "Everybody agrees – Democrat and Republican – everybody agrees that the money should come back – trillion dollars outside of this country. Everybody agrees that the money should be here and the politicians for three years haven’t been able to make a deal. And we could make a deal. There’s an example of something that you could do if I sat down with a few of the senators, a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in 10 minutes if you know what you’re doing because everybody wants to do it." - (Highlights elite failure, positions self as competent deal-maker, implying bypass of traditional legislative process) -> **manichaean, popular_sovereignty, authenticity_vs_political_class**
*   "And companies are actually leaving our country to get their money, not only because our taxes are too high, which we’re going to lower by the way. But companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money that’s their money because there’s no way of bringing it in." - (Economic issues, tax policy) -> **economic_populist**
*   "This has been very exciting, this whole process. We started, I was one of 17 people – senators, governors. I’ve had such great support. Dr. Ben Carson the other day endorsed us. Great guy. Great guy. Wonderful man. And Chris Christie endorsed us. That was so incredible. And today Pam Bondi came up and endorsed us. She was great. She is a truly wonderful woman, of the job she’s done in Florida is incredible. You know, so many – we’ve had such incredible support." - (Support from various figures, reinforcing legitimacy)
*   "Paul Ryan called me the other day – tremendous call. I spoke with Mitch McConnell today. We had a great conversation. The fact is we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together." - (Party unity, typical political rhetoric)
*   "We have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world. Everybody’s writing about it all over Europe, all over the world they’re talking about it. Millions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today." - (Mass mobilization, popular surge) -> **popular_sovereignty, homogeneous_people**
*   "Many, many more people. I’m looking at the polling booths. I’m looking at the different polling booths all around the country where it’s up. And the lines are four, five, six blocks long. And the woman – one woman was there for 40 years. She’s been working the polls. And she said, “We’d have two people here. We’d have three people. Now look at the line.” And the line looked like it was, you know, long. It was really long. Five deep and long. And it’s just a different thing. We have a great opportunity and the people that are voting are Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and very, very importantly, people that never voted before." - (People's participation, cross-party appeal, new voters) -> **popular_sovereignty, authenticity_vs_political_class, homogeneous_people**
*   "I want to pay my respects by the way to Todd Palin, Sarah’s husband. Sarah was here. She was incredible. She was making a speech on my behalf and fantastic and everybody loves her. And what happened is he was in a very bad accident. He’s tough as nails. He’s going to be fine. But I just wanted to pay my respects by the way to Todd." - (Personal anecdotes, empathy)
*   "So, our theme when we started and Melania and I came down. Yeah, sit down everybody. Please. I mean, this is Mar-a-Lago. We give you seats. You don’t have to stand. I’m looking at all these people. Corey, good job, Corey. Good job. And Hope and our whole squad. Right? So when this began, Melania and I and I said, “Got to do it.” And she was so supportive and she’s been so supportive. It’s been amazing. And we have to do it." - (Authenticity, personal mission) -> **authenticity_vs_political_class**
*   "We came down the escalator and it was about trade and it was about borders." - (Core issues identified early, consistent message) -> **economic_populist, nationalist_exclusion**
*   "And what happened is pretty quickly after that and we were – we shot right up. I shot right to the top of the polls and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning without fail." - (Success, polls)
*   "Most people said I’ll never run. He’s just going to have fun. He’s having a good time. This isn’t necessarily – I mean, I’m having a good time. You know, I’m having a very nice time. But you know what? I’m working very hard and there is great anger. Believe me. There is great anger." - (Addressing skepticism, emphasizing "anger" among the populace) -> **manichaean, crisis_restoration, authenticity_vs_political_class**
*   "One of the broadcasters was saying, “Is there anger?” And I said—I was supposed to say, “No, there’s not. We love the way things are working. We love the deal you made with Iran. It’s wonderful. You give them $150 billion. We get nothing. We love all the deals. The trade deals are wonderful. You lose $500 billion a year with China. We lose $58 billion a year in terms of imbalance. It’s a total imbalance.” - (Mocking perceived elite complacency, highlighting negative outcomes of current policies) -> **manichaean, crisis_restoration, elite_conspiracy (implied, bad deals), economic_populist**
*   "We don’t make good deals anymore. We don’t win anymore. As a country, we don’t win anymore. And they asked, “Is there anger from your people?”" - (Lack of winning, national decline) -> **crisis_restoration**
*   "They’re not angry people but they want to see the country properly run. They want to see borders. They want to see good health care. They want to see things properly taken care of. They want our military rebuilt. Our military is in a very bad state. They want it rebuilt. Very, very importantly, and they want the Second Amendment by the way protected and protected strongly and that’s going to happen. And you know what they want so badly? They want our veterans taken care of. Our veterans are treated so badly." - (People's specific desires, national decline, veterans' issues) -> **crisis_restoration, popular_sovereignty, nationalist_exclusion (borders)**
*   "So, we started and something happened called Paris. Paris happened and Paris was a disaster. That was – there have been many disasters. But it was Paris. And then we had a case in Los Angeles where it was in California where the 14 young people were killed. And it just goes on and on and on. And what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning, not just borders, not just good trade deals." - (Terrorist attacks, mass shootings, shift in campaign focus, national decline) -> **crisis_restoration, nationalist_exclusion (implied, security)**
*   "We’re going to make the best trade deals you’ve ever seen. We’ve got such endorsements from Carl Icahn and the smartest people in business. And these people are going to be negotiating our deals and they’re the best in the world. We have the best business people in the world. We’re going to have such great deals. We’re going to do so good with trade. We’re going to do so good on the border." - (Promising solutions, leveraging business expertise, competence vs. incompetence) -> **authenticity_vs_political_class, economic_populist, nationalist_exclusion**
*   "But it took on a whole new meaning, and the meaning was very simple. We need protection in our country and that’s going to happen and all of a sudden the poll numbers shot up. And I’m just very proud to be a part of this. I think we’re going to go. We’re going to go on a lot of trips over the next month but I think we’re going to have a great victory. And I think more importantly than anything else we are going to start winning again. This country is going to start winning again." - (Protectionism, winning, national restoration) -> **crisis_restoration, nationalist_exclusion, economic_populist**
*   "We don’t win anymore. We don’t win with our military. We can’t beat ISIS. We’re going to knock the hell out of them. We don’t win at trade – China, everybody, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India, name the country. Anybody we deal, anybody we do business with beats us. We don’t win at trade. We’re going to win at trade. We’re going to make our country rich again. We’re going to make our country great again. And we need the rich in order to make the great, I’m sorry to tell you." - (Repeated "don't win", national decline, promising victory and restoration, "make America great again") -> **crisis_restoration, nationalist_exclusion, economic_populist**
*   "So, I’m going forward. We had a fantastic evening. I would have never thought this could have happened. I guess we’re waiting for one result which possibly will be very successful also. But to win the states that we’ve won and to win by the margins and especially, look, this is my second home, Florida. To win by that kind of a number is incredible. It’s record-setting." - (Triumph, record-setting)
*   "And I have to say that number one, I want to congratulate Marco Rubio on having run a really rough campaign. He’s tough. He’s smart. And he’s got a great future. He’s got a great future. But I have to say and nobody has ever, ever in the history of politics received the kind of negative advertising that I have. Record, record, record. By the way, mostly false. I wouldn’t say 100% but about 90%. Mostly false, vicious, horrible. They said it was $18 million the first week, meaning last week, and $25 million. It added up to over $40 million. And you explain it to me because I can’t – my numbers went up. I don’t understand it. Nobody understands it. My numbers went up. I mean, it’s been an interesting experience." - (Addressing negative campaigning, portraying himself as uniquely targeted but successful, "mostly false, vicious, horrible") -> **manichaean, elite_conspiracy (implied, coordinated attacks), authenticity_vs_political_class**
*   "Last week, Adam Scott won at the Trump National Doral. Won the big tournament, the world championship of golf. And Adam, who’s a great guy – I guess a lot of you folks saw that – but I’m watching—we have television screens all over. We’re down at this gorgeous green at Doral and everything is working beautifully and then a commercial comes on. The worst commercial and I’m with these wonderful people from Cadillac and all these top executives, and I’m saying, “Look over there! Look! Don’t watch it. Don’t. You don’t want to watch it.” I’m saying, “Isn’t the grass beautiful? Look! Look! Don’t watch.” And they came in waves one after another after another and it was brutal." - (Anecdote about negative ads, portraying them as ineffective and bothersome) -> **elite_conspiracy (implied, the ads are "brutal" and coordinated), manichaean**
*   "And then Adam comes in. He’s this handsome kid from Australia, one of the greatest golfers in the world, made an unbelievable shot on the 18th hole to win the tournament. He’s a great champion. And we’re giving the award. And just before we break for a commercial, “We’ll be right back with our great champion from Australia, Adam Scott” and here’s the commercial and I said, “No.” And it was two of them – two of them. Oh, what a day that was. What a disaster. What a disaster. Unbelievable." - (More on negative ads, repetition of "disaster") -> **elite_conspiracy, manichaean**
*   "So again, I just want to congratulate everybody. This is a really interesting process. It’s an amazing process. It’s very tough. But it is – by the end, if you get to the end, you can handle a lot of things including pressure because there’s nothing like it. Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people. It’s true. Some are nice. Some are nice. Some really disgusting people back there. And I just want to say we’re going to go forward and we’re going to win. But more importantly, we’re going to win for the country. We’re going to win, win, win, and we’re not stopping. We’re going to have great victories for our country. Thank you very much everybody! Thank you!" - (Describing the political process as tough due to "lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people", contrasting with "some are nice", promising to win for the country) -> **manichaean, elite_conspiracy (reporters/media), authenticity_vs_political_class, crisis_restoration**

Overall themes: winning, crisis, disgust with political establishment, people's will, self-portrayal as an outsider/dealmaker.

**Approach 1: Evidence-First Analysis**

Focus on explicit statements and clear indicators.

*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**: "And I have to explain to these people they don’t understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it." (Clear distinction of "these people" (critics/establishment) as not understanding the "basics" vs. his implicit understanding.) "It’s just gross incompetence at the highest level." (Blaming elite incompetence explicitly). "Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people." (Direct moral indictment of media/political opponents).
    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Very strong, explicit moral dichotomy and direct attacks on elites/media)
    *   salience: 0.8 (Frequent and prominent throughout the speech, particularly when discussing poll numbers, companies leaving, and media coverage.)
    *   confidence: 0.9 (Highly confident due to direct, unequivocal language.)

*   **crisis_restoration_narrative**: "Our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly... I’m disgusted with it and I’m tired of seeing it and there’s no reason for it." (Clear framing of national decline). "We don’t make good deals anymore. We don’t win anymore. As a country, we don’t win anymore." (Repeated emphasis on national failure). "Our military is in a very bad state... Our veterans are treated so badly." (Specific areas of decline). "something happened called Paris. Paris happened and Paris was a disaster." (Foreign and domestic crises as evidence of decline). "This country is going to start winning again." (Direct promise of restoration).
    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Overwhelming evidence of decline-crisis-redemption narrative.)
    *   salience: 0.9 (Central to the justification for his candidacy and future plans; highly repetitive.)
    *   confidence: 1.0 (Extremely confident, this is a core theme.)

*   **popular_sovereignty_claims**: "So when I get 53% — and this one is an example, I had 53% and that’s with four people. That’s an achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50%." (Suggesting his popular support overrides traditional expectations). "Millions of people are coming in to vote. ... And the lines are four, five, six blocks long. ... people that never voted before." (Emphasis on direct popular mobilization, bypassing traditional political processes). "They’re not angry people but they want to see the country properly run." (Framing "the people's" desires as a mandate).
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong claims of popular will overriding norms.)
    *   salience: 0.7 (Highlighted by turnout anecdotes and implications for political action.)
    *   confidence: 0.9 (Clear and direct textual support.)

*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion**: "They’re not angry people but they want to see the country properly run." (Implies that those who disagree are not "the people" or don't want proper governance). "Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people." (Dehumanizes and delegitimizes opponents/critics, rejecting their right to participate legitimately in discourse). "Mostly false, vicious, horrible. They said it was $18 million the first week... And you explain it to me because I can’t – my numbers went up. I don’t understand it. Nobody understands it. My numbers went up." (Dismisses negative advertising/criticism as illegitimate and ineffective, implying a rejection of legitimate opposition tactics).
    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Strong delegitimization of opposition and media.)
    *   salience: 0.6 (Occurs in several key sections, but not as pervasive as crisis/manichaean framing.)
    *   confidence: 0.8 (Solid evidence of rejecting opposition's legitimacy.)

*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption**: "You have people who can’t get their money back into the country because the politicians can’t get along. They can’t make a deal." (Blames systemic failure on politicians' inability to act, implying a collective deficiency). "Mostly false, vicious, horrible. They said it was $18 million the first week... and $25 million. It added up to over $40 million." (Suggests a coordinated, well-funded, and "vicious" campaign against him by unnamed "they," implying hidden networks). "And they came in waves one after another after another and it was brutal." (Describes negative ads as a coordinated attack, implying a systemic effort to undermine him).
    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Implied coordination and systemic nature of attacks, rather than isolated incidents.)
    *   salience: 0.6 (The negative advertising narrative is prominent, suggesting a coordinated effort.)
    *   confidence: 0.7 (Evidence is present but often relies on implication of coordination rather than explicit conspiracy claims.)

*   **authenticity_vs_political_class**: "And I have to explain to these people they don’t understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it." (Positions himself as having common sense/understanding compared to out-of-touch elites). "if I sat down with a few of the senators, a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in 10 minutes if you know what you’re doing because everybody wants to do it." (Contrasts his practical "deal-making" ability with politicians' gridlock). "I’m not a politician, I’m a real person" (Implicit in his rhetoric, "I’m disgusted with it and I’m tired of seeing it" - common man's frustration). "We came down the escalator and it was about trade and it was about borders." (Simple, direct mission statement, contrasting with complex political rhetoric).
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on his practical, non-political approach.)
    *   salience: 0.7 (This is a recurring self-presentation strategy.)
    *   confidence: 0.8 (Clear presentation of himself as different from the political class.)

*   **homogeneous_people_construction**: "Millions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today. Many, many more people. ... Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and very, very importantly, people that never voted before." (Constructs a broad, unified "people" transcending traditional party lines, united by the desire for change). "They’re not angry people but they want to see the country properly run." (Presents a unified "the people" with shared, simple goals.)
    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Evidence of unification across traditional divides.)
    *   salience: 0.6 (Prominent in his discussion of voter turnout.)
    *   confidence: 0.8 (Clear efforts to present a unified base.)

*   **nationalist_exclusion**: "Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China, Vietnam..." (Economic nationalism, defining in-group vs. out-group based on national economic interest). "They want to see borders." (Explicit call for national boundaries and protection). "We don’t win at trade – China, everybody, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India, name the country. Anybody we deal, anybody we do business with beats us." (Framing international economic relations as a zero-sum game where other nations are "beating us," implying external threat).
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on national boundaries, economic protectionism, and external threats.)
    *   salience: 0.7 (Core to his economic and security platform.)
    *   confidence: 0.9 (Explicit and clear.)

*   **economic_populist_appeals**: "Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China, Vietnam..." (Clear economic protectionism). "Our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly... I’m disgusted with it and I’m tired of seeing it and there’s no reason for it. It’s just gross incompetence at the highest level." (Blaming economic woes on elite failure). "We don’t make good deals anymore. We don’t win anymore. As a country, we don’t win anymore." (Framing economic issues in terms of national failure and the need for new leadership). "We’re going to make our country rich again." (Promise of economic restoration).
    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Dominant theme, linking economic issues to elite incompetence and national decline.)
    *   salience: 0.9 (Highly central to the entire speech and his platform.)
    *   confidence: 1.0 (Extremely confident, this is pervasive.)

---
**Approach 2: Context-Weighted Analysis**

Emphasize rhetorical context, structural positioning, and thematic centrality.

*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**: The speech opens with celebration, but quickly pivots to framing negative media commentary and "incompetence at the highest level" as obstacles. This adversarial framing recurs structurally, especially when discussing "disgusting reporters" at the end. The implied opposition of the "people" (voters) vs. "these people" (critics/politicians) is central.
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Less about explicit moral condemnation, more about framing "them" as incompetent obstacles to "us".)
    *   salience: 0.9 (The "us vs. them" framing provides a pervasive undercurrent, structuring many of his arguments.)
    *   confidence: 0.9 (The consistent contrast permeates the speech's message.)

*   **crisis_restoration_narrative**: This narrative is the backbone of the speech's justification for Trump's campaign. He starts by noting national decline ("companies are leaving," "we don't win anymore") and uses specific events (Paris, LA shooting) as evidence of a deeper crisis ("took on a whole new meaning"). The constant repetition of "we're going to win again," "make our country great again," etc., especially at the end, structurally reinforces the restoration promise.
    *   raw_score: 0.9 (The crisis is presented as severe and widespread.)
    *   salience: 1.0 (It's the overarching rhetorical strategy, giving purpose to his campaign and policy promises.)
    *   confidence: 1.0 (Absolutely central and pervasive.)

*   **popular_sovereignty_claims**: His discussion of polling booth lines and "people that never voted before" is positioned as key evidence of a new, direct popular mandate, contrasting with the "ridiculous" old political math. This emphasis on mass mobilization ("millions of people are coming in to vote") is thematically central to his claim of legitimacy and power.
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong claims of popular authority through direct voter action.)
    *   salience: 0.8 (High prominence, structurally highlighted by anecdotes about long lines and new voters.)
    *   confidence: 0.9 (Clear contextual emphasis.)

*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion**: The dismissal of negative advertising as "mostly false, vicious, horrible" and his inability to "understand" why his numbers went up despite it, is a rhetorical move to delegitimize any opposition. By framing critics as "disgusting reporters, horrible people," he seeks to exclude their views from legitimate political discourse. This is thematically consistent with his "winning" narrative.
    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Delegitimization is present but slightly less explicit than in Approach 1.)
    *   salience: 0.7 (This delegitimization of opposition, particularly media, features prominently in several segments.)
    *   confidence: 0.8 (The strategic dismissal of criticism is clear.)

*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption**: While not explicitly using the word "conspiracy," the framing of negative ads as a coordinated, well-funded, "brutal" campaign "in waves one after another" against him suggests a systemic, almost conspiratorial effort by "them." This forms a thematic counter-narrative to his own popular surge, implying that "they" (unnamed forces) are working against the popular will.
    *   raw_score: 0.7 (The systemic nature is strongly implied through the description of the attacks.)
    *   salience: 0.7 (The extensive description of the negative ads gives this theme significant prominence, especially the anecdotes about the Doral golf tournament.)
    *   confidence: 0.8 (The context strongly points to perceived coordinated action.)

*   **authenticity_vs_political_class**: Trump positions himself as a deal-maker and someone who understands "basic physics" and "mathematics" when "these people" (politicians/media) don't. His personal anecdotes (family, Mar-a-Lago, "came down the escalator") are used to present a relatable, non-political persona. This contrasts implicitly with the "gross incompetence at the highest level" he attributes to traditional politicians. This self-presentation is pervasive.
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Consistent self-framing as an authentic outsider.)
    *   salience: 0.8 (Pervasive, intertwined with his criticism of elites and claims of competence.)
    *   confidence: 0.9 (Strong rhetorical strategy.)

*   **homogeneous_people_construction**: The repeated anecdotes about massive voter turnout, including Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters, serves to construct a broad, undifferentiated "people" united by a desire for change. This rhetorical construction simplifies complex demographics into a single, powerful "will of the people." Thematic centrality is high in reinforcing his mandate.
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on unifying elements.)
    *   salience: 0.7 (The stories of voter turnout are a key part of his victory narrative.)
    *   confidence: 0.8 (Clear and consistently used.)

*   **nationalist_exclusion**: The focus on "borders," "companies leaving our country," and "we don't win anymore" against specific foreign entities (China, Vietnam, Japan, Mexico, India) are structurally central to his policy positions. This rhetorical strategy clearly defines an in-group (USA/Americans) and an out-group (foreign competitors/threats), justifying protectionist and nationalistic policies.
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong and explicit nationalist framing.)
    *   salience: 0.8 (Central to his argument for economic change and national security.)
    *   confidence: 0.9 (Highly apparent.)

*   **economic_populist_appeals**: This is perhaps the most contextually central theme. The "crisis" he identifies (companies leaving, bad trade deals) is primarily economic, and his "restoration" promises (making companies stay, good deals, "make our country rich again") are also economic. He consistently blames the current economic decline on the incompetence of the political establishment.
    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Economic issues are presented as fundamental problems requiring populist solutions.)
    *   salience: 1.0 (The entire rationale for his candidacy and vision is deeply rooted in economic grievances and proposed solutions.)
    *   confidence: 1.0 (Pervasive and undeniably central.)

**Approach 3: Pattern-Based Analysis**

Look for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis.

*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**: Repetition of phrases like "gross incompetence at the highest level," "ridiculous," "disgusting reporters, horrible people." Use of personal anecdotes to highlight difference: "I have to explain to these people they don’t understand..." This pattern of dismissing opponents' intellect or morality recurs.
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Consistent verbal attacks on elites.)
    *   salience: 0.8 (The recurring insults and framing of critics as "horrible" or "disgusting" makes this highly salient.)
    *   confidence: 0.9 (Strong patterns of elite-blaming.)

*   **crisis_restoration_narrative**: Heavy repetition of "we don't win anymore" (at least 4 times), "make our country great again," "start winning again." The narrative structure consistently moves from current failures (companies leaving, bad deals, weak military, neglected veterans, "disasters" like Paris) to future victory through his leadership. This cyclical pattern is a core rhetorical device.
    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Repeated phrases and narrative structure confirm the intensity.)
    *   salience: 1.0 (The most pronounced rhetorical pattern, central to the speech's message.)
    *   confidence: 1.0 (Undeniable pattern.)

*   **popular_sovereignty_claims**: Emphasis through vivid descriptions and numerical claims: "Millions of people are coming in to vote," "lines are four, five, six blocks long," "people that never voted before." The "53%" poll anecdote is used to reframe traditional political analysis, asserting popular will as supreme. This pattern emphasizes popular uprising over institutional process.
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on quantity and impact of popular support.)
    *   salience: 0.7 (The concrete examples of voter turnout serve to highlight this.)
    *   confidence: 0.9 (Clear rhetorical patterns reinforce this.)

*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion**: Repetition of "vicious," "horrible," "mostly false" to describe negative advertising and "disgusting reporters." The rhetorical effect is to systematically invalidate dissenting voices or opposition tactics. The phrase "What a disaster" is applied to political attacks, equating opposition with catastrophe.
    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Use of strong negative adjectives to describe opposition.)
    *   salience: 0.6 (Prominent in his responses to criticism, creating a pattern of dismissal.)
    *   confidence: 0.7 (The patterned dismissal is clear.)

*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption**: The repeated descriptions of negative ads coming "in waves one after another after another" and being "brutal" and "disaster" creates a pattern of an overwhelming, coordinated, and illegitimate attack. While not explicitly naming a conspiracy, the consistent framing implies a concerted effort by "them."
    *   raw_score: 0.6 (Implied through consistent negative framing of opposition activities.)
    *   salience: 0.6 (The extended anecdote about the negative ads and the golf tournament highlights this patterned attack.)
    *   confidence: 0.7 (Pattern of describing organized, negative campaigns.)

*   **authenticity_vs_political_class**: Self-referential statements like "I'm working very hard," "I'm not a politician," and focusing on his business background. Contrasting his ability to "make a deal in 10 minutes" with politicians who "can't get along" is a repeated rhetorical juxtaposition. The frequent use of "I" when talking about solutions positions him as the unique, authentic actor.
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Consistent self-presentation as an authentic outsider.)
    *   salience: 0.7 (Pervasive through personal anecdotes and direct comparisons.)
    *   confidence: 0.8 (Clear rhetorical positioning.)

*   **homogeneous_people_construction**: The inclusive language when describing voters ("Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and... people that never voted before") creates a unified image of "the people." The collective "we" ("We have so, so many great people") reinforces this homogeneity, emphasizing shared identity over division.
    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Consistent use of inclusive and unifying language for his supporters.)
    *   salience: 0.6 (The descriptions of voter turnout provide strong examples.)
    *   confidence: 0.7 (Clear patterns of unifying language.)

*   **nationalist_exclusion**: Repetition of "in the United States, not in China, Vietnam..." and listing multiple countries ("China, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India"). The recurring theme of "borders" and "protection in our country" defines the in-group ("our country") against foreign out-groups. The "we don't win anymore" applies specifically to international relations.
    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong, consistent pattern of identifying foreign threats and emphasizing national protection.)
    *   salience: 0.8 (Highly repetitive and central to his policy arguments.)
    *   confidence: 0.9 (Clear and consistent pattern.)

*   **economic_populist_appeals**: High frequency of economic terms ("companies leaving," "trade deals," "taxes," "money back into the country," "rich again"). The repeated phrases "we don't win anymore" and "make our country rich again" are directly tied to economic grievances and solutions, forming a dominant rhetorical pattern.
    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Very high frequency of economic themes.)
    *   salience: 1.0 (The most frequent and dominant rhetorical pattern throughout the speech.)
    *   confidence: 1.0 (Pervasive and undeniable.)
