  "raw_analysis_response": "I'll analyze the document using three independent analytical approaches as specified.\n\n**APPROACH 1: Evidence-First Analysis**\nFocusing on direct textual evidence and explicit statements:\n\n- **Manichean People-Elite Framing**: 0.8 (Strong binary framing: \"pure, virtuous people\" vs. \"corrupt, self-serving elites\" - explicit in Hillary Clinton email critique, \"criminals\" vs. protection rhetoric)\n- **Crisis-Restoration Narrative**: 0.7 (Clear decline language: \"depleted military,\" \"record-setting lows,\" with restoration promises to make military \"stronger than ever before\")\n- **Popular Sovereignty Claims**: 0.4 (Some direct democracy appeals but limited institutional bypass rhetoric)\n- **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**: 0.3 (Limited opposition rejection, mostly policy disagreement)\n- **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**: 0.6 (Clear corruption claims about Hillary Clinton, system manipulation)\n- **Authenticity vs Political Class**: 0.5 (Some outsider positioning but not central theme)\n- **Homogeneous People Construction**: 0.6 (Veterans as unified virtuous group, \"forgotten man and woman\")\n- **Nationalist Exclusion**: 0.5 (Immigration threat language, cultural boundary-drawing)\n- **Economic Populist Appeals**: 0.4 (Some economic grievance framing)\n\n**APPROACH 2: Context-Weighted Analysis**\nEmphasizing rhetorical context and structural positioning:\n\n- **Manichean People-Elite Framing**: 0.9 (Central structural theme throughout speech)\n- **Crisis-Restoration Narrative**: 0.8 (Opens and closes with crisis-restoration framing)\n- **Popular Sovereignty Claims**: 0.5 (Moderate emphasis on direct representation)\n- **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**: 0.4 (Some exclusionary rhetoric toward opponents)\n- **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**: 0.7 (Prominent corruption themes)\n- **Authenticity vs Political Class**: 0.7 (Strong positioning as outsider throughout)\n- **Homogeneous People Construction**: 0.8 (Veterans and \"forgotten people\" as central unified identity)\n- **Nationalist Exclusion**: 0.6 (Immigration and external threat emphasis)\n- **Economic Populist Appeals**: 0.3 (Limited economic populist framing)\n\n**APPROACH 3: Pattern-Based Analysis**\nLooking for repetition patterns and strategic emphasis:\n\n- **Manichean People-Elite Framing**: 0.7 (Repeated corruption vs. virtue patterns)\n- **Crisis-Restoration Narrative**: 0.6 (Consistent decline-restoration language pattern)\n- **Popular Sovereignty Claims**: 0.3 (Limited repetition of direct democracy themes)\n- **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**: 0.2 (Minimal exclusionary pattern repetition)\n- **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**: 0.5 (Moderate repetition of conspiracy themes)\n- **Authenticity vs Political Class**: 0.6 (Consistent outsider positioning pattern)\n- **Homogeneous People Construction**: 0.7 (Strong unity construction patterns)\n- **Nationalist Exclusion**: 0.4 (Some repeated boundary-drawing)\n- **Economic Populist Appeals**: 0.5 (Moderate economic grievance patterns)\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_ANALYSIS_JSON_v6>>>\n{\n  \"analysis_metadata\": {\n    \"framework_name\":
