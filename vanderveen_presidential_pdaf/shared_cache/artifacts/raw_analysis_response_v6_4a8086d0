The user wants me to act as an expert discourse analyst and apply a provided framework to a given document.
I need to perform three independent analyses, calculate median scores, select the best evidence, and format the output as a specific JSON structure.

**Framework Analysis Plan:**
1.  **Decode Framework and Documents:** Decode the base64 encoded framework and document.
2.  **Understand Dimensions:** Carefully review each of the nine dimensions and their scoring calibration guidelines, along with positive/negative examples.
    *   **Primary Populist Core Anchors:**
        1.  `manichaean_people_elite_framing`: Moral dichotomy between pure people and corrupt elites.
        2.  `crisis_restoration_narrative`: Decline-crisis-redemption temporal structuring.
        3.  `popular_sovereignty_claims`: Direct popular will as ultimate authority, bypassing institutions.
        4.  `anti_pluralist_exclusion`: Rejection of legitimate opposition and institutional constraints.
    *   **Populist Mechanism Anchors:**
        5.  `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption`: Elite coordination against people's interests through hidden networks or institutional capture.
        6.  `authenticity_vs_political_class`: Speaker's genuine representation vs. professional politician artifice.
        7.  `homogeneous_people_construction`: Unified people identity transcending internal divisions.
    *   **Boundary Distinction Anchors:**
        8.  `nationalist_exclusion`: Cultural/ethnic homogeneity and external threat emphasis defining community boundaries.
        9.  `economic_populist_appeals`: Populist economic discourse regardless of ideological direction (left/right).

3.  **Perform Three Independent Analyses per Document:**
    *   **Approach 1: Evidence-First Analysis:** Focus strictly on explicit statements and clear textual indicators. Score dimensions based on direct quotes.
    *   **Approach 2: Context-Weighted Analysis:** Consider the rhetorical context, structural positioning (e.g., introduction, conclusion, central themes), and thematic centrality of each dimension within the speech.
    *   **Approach 3: Pattern-Based Analysis:** Look for repetition of keywords, rhetorical devices (metaphors, analogies), and strategic emphasis through frequency or rhetorical intensity.

    For each approach, for each dimension:
    *   Assign a `raw_score` (0.0-1.0).
    *   Assign a `salience` score (0.0-1.0).
    *   Assign a `confidence` score (0.0-1.0).
    *   Extract the most relevant `evidence` quote. If no quote, use an empty string.

4.  **Aggregate Results:**
    *   For each dimension, calculate the median `raw_score`, `salience`, and `confidence` across the three approaches.
    *   For each dimension, select the "best" evidence quote (e.g., from the approach with the highest confidence for that dimension, or most representative).

5.  **Format Output:** Construct the final JSON object precisely as specified, including all metadata and delimiters.

**Document to Analyze:** `clinton/general_election/clinton_2016_08_31.txt` (Clinton's speech on American Exceptionalism)

**Pre-computation/Pre-analysis for myself (mental walkthrough):**

*   **Document Content Overview:** The speech is from Hillary Clinton, likely during her 2016 campaign. The title "American Exceptionalism" suggests a focus on American strength, global leadership, and national identity. It's probably less about traditional 'people vs. elite' populism and more about national unity, competence, and global role. There will likely be contrasts with an "opponent" (Trump) who might represent a different view of American strength or alliances.

*   **Expected Dimension Scores (Initial Hypothesis based on Title/Topic):**
    *   `manichaean_people_elite_framing`: Low, Clinton typically doesn't frame in this way.
    *   `crisis_restoration_narrative`: Moderate. There might be a sense of current challenges needing restoration, but probably not framed as a deep betrayal. She contrasts her vision with an opponent's "wrong" view, implying some crisis.
    *   `popular_sovereignty_claims`: Low. Focus more on institutional processes, leadership, and alliances rather than direct popular will bypassing institutions.
    *   `anti_pluralist_exclusion`: Low. Clinton emphasizes unity and working with both parties. She criticizes her opponent, but likely not to the point of denying their legitimacy entirely.
    *   `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption`: Very low. Not her typical rhetorical style.
    *   `authenticity_vs_political_class`: Low. She is a quintessential political insider. Will likely emphasize experience and competence.
    *   `homogeneous_people_construction`: High. Expect strong appeals to national unity, transcending divisions, especially when discussing the military.
    *   `nationalist_exclusion`: Moderate to High. "American Exceptionalism" is inherently nationalistic. She will likely emphasize American uniqueness and leadership, possibly contrasting with external threats (Russia, ISIS).
    *   `economic_populist_appeals`: Low. The speech seems focused on foreign policy/military, not domestic economic grievances.

Let's break down the three approaches for the document.

**Document: clinton/general_election/clinton_2016_08_31.txt**

**APPROACH 1: Evidence-First Analysis**

*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**:
    *   Score: 0.0, Salience: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0
    *   Evidence: ""
    *   Reasoning: No direct moral dichotomy between pure people and corrupt, self-serving elites. The criticism of her opponent is based on policy and temperament, not moral corruption of an elite class.

*   **crisis_restoration_narrative**:
    *   Score: 0.6, Salience: 0.6, Confidence: 0.8
    *   Evidence: "My opponent is wrong when he says America is no longer great. Consider the record of the past eight years. In 2009 our global economy was collapsing, Osama bin Laden was plotting, we had more than 180,000 troops fighting two wars, Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon, many of our allies were less supportive of American leadership than they had been in decades. Look where we are now. We have pulled the global economy out of free-fall thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people."
    *   Reasoning: She frames a clear "decline" ("no longer great", "global economy was collapsing", "allies less supportive") and then presents a "restoration" narrative ("Look where we are now. We have pulled the global economy out of free-fall"). This fits the decline-crisis-redemption arc, though it attributes restoration to the "American people" rather than solely herself.

*   **popular_sovereignty_claims**:
    *   Score: 0.1, Salience: 0.1, Confidence: 0.7
    *   Evidence: "I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans, independents, for people who vote for me, for people who don't, for all Americans. That is what I think we need. We need to unify our country and go forward into the future with confidence and optimism."
    *   Reasoning: While she mentions serving "all Americans" and unifying the country, it's framed within the traditional representative democratic process. There's no claim of direct popular will bypassing institutions.

*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion**:
    *   Score: 0.3, Salience: 0.4, Confidence: 0.7
    *   Evidence: "My opponent misses something important. When we say America is exceptional, it doesn’t mean that people from other places don’t feel deep national pride, just like we do. It means that we recognize America’s unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress, a champion for freedom and opportunity." and "The stakes this fall are as high as any election in our lifetimes. So I’m going to keep raising these issues, keep telling people where I stand, laying out plans for what I’d do if elected. This election shouldn’t be about ideology. It’s not just about differences over policy. It truly is about who has the experience and the temperament to serve as President and Commander-in-Chief."
    *   Reasoning: She criticizes her opponent's view of American exceptionalism and his fitness for office, labeling his views as "wrong" and "dangerous." She doesn't deny his legitimacy as an opponent, but she positions his stance as a fundamental misunderstanding ("misses something important") and contrasts it with a principled approach. This is weak exclusion, mostly policy/temperament critique.

*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruptio**n:
    *   Score: 0.0, Salience: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0
    *   Evidence: ""
    *   Reasoning: No evidence of claims of hidden elite coordination or systemic corruption.

*   **authenticity_vs_political_class**:
    *   Score: 0.1, Salience: 0.1, Confidence: 0.7
    *   Evidence: "I get criticized for having so many plans. People say, oh, there she goes with another plan about mental health, about veterans. Well I have this old fashioned idea if I’m asking for your vote for president I should tell you what I want to do as your president."
    *   Reasoning: She directly addresses a "criticism" about her having "so many plans" and presents it as an "old fashioned idea" of a responsible candidate, rather than a claim of being "outside" the political class. It's about competence, not anti-establishment authenticity.

*   **homogeneous_people_construction**:
    *   Score: 0.7, Salience: 0.7, Confidence: 0.9
    *   Evidence: "Everyone who works harder, dreams bigger and never, ever stops trying to make our country and the world a better place. And part of what makes America an exceptional nation, is that we are also an indispensable nation." and "We need to unify our country and go forward into the future with confidence and optimism." and "our armed forces which represents all races, religions, ethnicities and yes, immigrants from other countries all fighting for the red, white and blue."
    *   Reasoning: Strong emphasis on unity and collective identity ("all Americans," "unify our country," "our armed forces which represents all races, religions, ethnicities"). This transcends internal divisions in favor of a shared national purpose.

*   **nationalist_exclusion**:
    *   Score: 0.5, Salience: 0.6, Confidence: 0.8
    *   Evidence: "The United States is an exceptional nation. I believe we are still Lincoln’s last, best hope of Earth. We’re still Reagan’s shining city on a hill. We’re still Robert Kennedy’s great, unselfish, compassionate country." and "When America fails to lead, we leave a vacuum that either causes chaos or other countries or networks rush in to fill the void." and "No other country in the world has alliances like ours. Russia and China have nothing close."
    *   Reasoning: Strong claims of American exceptionalism and indispensability, directly contrasting US alliances with Russia and China. This sets a clear boundary for "our" nation's unique role and value compared to others, implicitly excluding them from this level of positive global influence.

*   **economic_populist_appeals**:
    *   Score: 0.0, Salience: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0
    *   Evidence: ""
    *   Reasoning: The speech has very little focus on economic issues, and what little there is (e.g., pulling economy out of free-fall) is framed as a national achievement, not a populist economic grievance against elites.

---

**APPROACH 2: Context-Weighted Analysis**

*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**:
    *   Score: 0.0, Salience: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0
    *   Evidence: ""
    *   Reasoning: The overarching theme is national unity and American leadership, not an internal moral struggle between people and elites. The antagonist is framed as an opponent with bad ideas, not a corrupt elite.

*   **crisis_restoration_narrative**:
    *   Score: 0.7, Salience: 0.8, Confidence: 0.9
    *   Evidence: "My opponent is wrong when he says America is no longer great. Consider the record of the past eight years. In 2009 our global economy was collapsing, Osama bin Laden was plotting, we had more than 180,000 troops fighting two wars, Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon, many of our allies were less supportive of American leadership than they had been in decades. Look where we are now. We have pulled the global economy out of free-fall thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people."
    *   Reasoning: This narrative forms a central rhetorical pillar, framing the challenges inherited from the past as a "crisis" and presenting the speaker's (and Obama's) tenure as a period of successful "restoration." It contrasts directly with the opponent's alleged claim that America is "no longer great," making the crisis-restoration arc a core argument for her competence and leadership. It's placed centrally in the speech's policy argument section.

*   **popular_sovereignty_claims**:
    *   Score: 0.1, Salience: 0.1, Confidence: 0.7
    *   Evidence: "I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans, independents, for people who vote for me, for people who don’t, for all Americans."
    *   Reasoning: While appealing broadly to "all Americans," the rhetoric strongly upholds existing democratic institutions and the role of a president within them. There's no suggestion of bypassing representation for direct popular will. It's a standard unity appeal.

*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion**:
    *   Score: 0.3, Salience: 0.5, Confidence: 0.8
    *   Evidence: "My opponent in this race has said very clearly that he thinks American exceptionalism is insulting to the rest of the world. In fact, when Vladimir Putin, of all people, criticized American exceptionalism, my opponent agreed with him, saying, and I quote, 'if you’re in Russia, you don’t want to hear that America is exceptional.' Well maybe you don’t want to hear it, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true." and "This election shouldn’t be about ideology. It’s not just about differences over policy. It truly is about who has the experience and the temperament to serve as President and Commander-in-Chief."
    *   Reasoning: The opponent's stance on American exceptionalism is repeatedly highlighted and framed as misguided or dangerous, associating him with Putin's criticism. The speech attempts to delegitimize the opponent's perspective by questioning his understanding of a core national value, implying his views are an existential threat to American identity and global leadership. This positioning is central to the speech's argumentative structure.

*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruptio**n:
    *   Score: 0.0, Salience: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0
    *   Evidence: ""
    *   Reasoning: No thematic focus or structural emphasis on hidden elite coordination or systemic corruption.

*   **authenticity_vs_political_class**:
    *   Score: 0.1, Salience: 0.1, Confidence: 0.7
    *   Evidence: "I get criticized for having so many plans. People say, oh, there she goes with another plan about mental health, about veterans. Well I have this old fashioned idea if I’m asking for your vote for president I should tell you what I want to do as your president."
    *   Reasoning: This is a passing reference, not a central theme. It's a deflection of a criticism rather than a strong assertion of "outsider" authenticity against a "political class."

*   **homogeneous_people_construction**:
    *   Score: 0.8, Salience: 0.8, Confidence: 0.9
    *   Evidence: "We need to unify our country and go forward into the future with confidence and optimism." and "our armed forces which represents all races, religions, ethnicities and yes, immigrants from other countries all fighting for the red, white and blue."
    *   Reasoning: The call for unity ("unify our country") and the description of the military as representing "all races, religions, ethnicities and yes, immigrants" are central to her vision of American strength and exceptionalism. This rhetorical construction of a unified "people" is a consistent theme throughout the speech, particularly in the sections discussing national identity and military service.

*   **nationalist_exclusion**:
    *   Score: 0.7, Salience: 0.9, Confidence: 0.9
    *   Evidence: "The United States is an exceptional nation. I believe we are still Lincoln’s last, best hope of Earth. We’re still Reagan’s shining city on a hill. We’re still Robert Kennedy’s great, unselfish, compassionate country." and "No other country in the world has alliances like ours. Russia and China have nothing close."
    *   Reasoning: American exceptionalism is the explicit title and dominant theme of the speech. It's not just pride; it's a claim of unique global leadership and moral superiority, directly contrasted with other nations (Russia, China) who "have nothing close." This is presented as fundamental to America's role in the world and forms the core of her foreign policy argument.

*   **economic_populist_appeals**:
    *   Score: 0.0, Salience: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0
    *   Evidence: ""
    *   Reasoning: The speech is not structured around economic grievance or conflict between economic classes. Economic mentions are about national recovery or military spending, not populist appeals.

**APPROACH 3: Pattern-Based Analysis**

*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**:
    *   Score: 0.0, Salience: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0
    *   Evidence: ""
    *   Reasoning: No recurring patterns of "us vs. them" with moral overtones between ordinary citizens and corrupt power holders.

*   **crisis_restoration_narrative**:
    *   Score: 0.6, Salience: 0.7, Confidence: 0.8
    *   Evidence: "My opponent is wrong when he says America is no longer great. Consider the record of the past eight years. In 2009 our global economy was collapsing, Osama bin Laden was plotting, we had more than 180,000 troops fighting two wars, Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon, many of our allies were less supportive of American leadership than they had been in decades. Look where we are now. We have pulled the global economy out of free-fall thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people."
    *   Reasoning: The "decline" and "restoration" pattern is evident through the comparison of 2009 ("collapsing," "plotting," "racing") to "Look where we are now," repeated multiple times (economy, troops, Iran deal, bin Laden). This structured temporal comparison forms a key persuasive pattern.

*   **popular_sovereignty_claims**:
    *   Score: 0.1, Salience: 0.1, Confidence: 0.7
    *   Evidence: "I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans, independents, for people who vote for me, for people who don’t, for all Americans."
    *   Reasoning: The phrase "for all Americans" is a common political trope, but it doesn't imply bypassing representative democracy. There's no patterned language suggesting direct popular will as the supreme authority.

*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion**:
    *   Score: 0.4, Salience: 0.6, Confidence: 0.8
    *   Evidence: "My opponent in this race has said very clearly that he thinks American exceptionalism is insulting to the rest of the world. In fact, when Vladimir Putin, of all people, criticized American exceptionalism, my opponent agreed with him, saying, and I quote, 'if you’re in Russia, you don’t want to hear that America is exceptional.' Well maybe you don’t want to hear it, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true." and "This election shouldn’t be about ideology. It’s not just about differences over policy. It truly is about who has the experience and the temperament to serve as President and Commander-in-Chief."
    *   Reasoning: The consistent framing of the opponent's views as "wrong," "dangerous," and even aligning with Putin ("of all people") demonstrates a pattern of delegitimizing his position. The repeated emphasis on his lack of "experience and temperament" also serves to exclude him as a legitimate alternative for leadership, even if not fully denying his right to participate.

*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruptio**n:
    *   Score: 0.0, Salience: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0
    *   Evidence: ""
    *   Reasoning: No linguistic patterns or devices suggesting a hidden, coordinated elite conspiracy.

*   **authenticity_vs_political_class**:
    *   Score: 0.1, Salience: 0.1, Confidence: 0.7
    *   Evidence: "I get criticized for having so many plans. People say, oh, there she goes with another plan about mental health, about veterans. Well I have this old fashioned idea if I’m asking for your vote for president I should tell you what I want to do as your president."
    *   Reasoning: A single instance of acknowledging criticism and reframing it as an "old-fashioned idea" doesn't establish a consistent pattern of "authenticity vs. political class" rhetoric.

*   **homogeneous_people_construction**:
    *   Score: 0.8, Salience: 0.8, Confidence: 0.9
    *   Evidence: "We need to unify our country and go forward into the future with confidence and optimism." and "our armed forces which represents all races, religions, ethnicities and yes, immigrants from other countries all fighting for the red, white and blue."
    *   Reasoning: Frequent use of "we," "our country," and emphasizing unity across internal divisions ("all races, religions, ethnicities and yes, immigrants") is a strong rhetorical pattern. This is particularly salient when discussing the military, a symbol of national unity.

*   **nationalist_exclusion**:
    *   Score: 0.7, Salience: 0.9, Confidence: 0.9
    *   Evidence: "The United States is an exceptional nation. I believe we are still Lincoln’s last, best hope of Earth. We’re still Reagan’s shining city on a hill. We’re still Robert Kennedy’s great, unselfish, compassionate country." and "No other country in the world has alliances like ours. Russia and China have nothing close."
    *   Reasoning: The repeated invocation of "American exceptionalism" (also in the speech title) and its historical figures (Lincoln, Reagan, RFK) establishes a strong pattern of national pride and uniqueness. The direct negative comparison with Russia and China further reinforces this boundary-drawing, emphasizing US supremacy.

*   **economic_populist_appeals**:
