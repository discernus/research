Score dimensions based on direct quotes.\n    *   **Approach 2: Context-Weighted Analysis:** Consider the rhetorical context, structural positioning (e.g., introduction, conclusion, central themes), and thematic centrality of each dimension within the speech.\n    *   **Approach 3: Pattern-Based Analysis:** Look for repetition of keywords, rhetorical devices (metaphors, analogies), and strategic emphasis through frequency or rhetorical intensity.\n\n    For each approach, for each dimension:\n    *   Assign a `raw_score` (0.0-1.0).\n    *   Assign a `salience` score (0.0-1.0).\n    *   Assign a `confidence` score (0.0-1.0).\n    *   Extract the most relevant `evidence` quote. If no quote, use an empty string.\n\n4.  **Aggregate Results:**\n    *   For each dimension, calculate the median `raw_score`, `salience`, and `confidence` across the three approaches.\n    *   For each dimension, select the \"best\" evidence quote (e.g., from the approach with the highest confidence for that dimension, or most representative).\n\n5.  **Format Output:** Construct the final JSON object precisely as specified, including all metadata and delimiters.\n\n**Document to Analyze:** `clinton/general_election/clinton_2016_08_31.txt` (Clinton's speech on American Exceptionalism)\n\n**Pre-computation/Pre-analysis for myself (mental walkthrough):**\n\n*   **Document Content Overview:** The speech is from Hillary Clinton, likely during her 2016 campaign. The title \"American Exceptionalism\" suggests a focus on American strength, global leadership, and national identity. It's probably less about traditional 'people vs. elite' populism and more about national unity, competence, and global role. There will likely be contrasts with an \"opponent\" (Trump) who might represent a different view of American strength or alliances.\n\n*   **Expected Dimension Scores (Initial Hypothesis based on Title/Topic):**\n    *   `manichaean_people_elite_framing`: Low, Clinton typically doesn't frame in this way.\n    *   `crisis_restoration_narrative`: Moderate. There might be a sense of current challenges needing restoration, but probably not framed as a deep betrayal. She contrasts her vision with an opponent's \"wrong\" view, implying some crisis.\n    *   `popular_sovereignty_claims`: Low. Focus more on institutional processes, leadership, and alliances rather than direct popular will bypassing institutions.\n    *   `anti_pluralist_exclusion`: Low. Clinton emphasizes unity and working with both parties. She criticizes her opponent, but likely not to the point of denying their legitimacy entirely.\n    *   `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption`: Very low. Not her typical rhetorical style.\n    *   `authenticity_vs_political_class`: Low. She is a quintessential political insider. Will likely emphasize experience and competence.\n    *   `homogeneous_people_construction`: High. Expect strong appeals to national unity, transcending divisions, especially when discussing the military.\n    *   `nationalist_exclusion`: Moderate to High. \"American Exceptionalism\" is inherently nationalistic. She will likely emphasize American uniqueness and leadership, possibly contrasting with external threats (Russia, ISIS).\n    *   `economic_populist_appeals`: Low. The speech seems focused on foreign policy/military, not domestic economic grievances.\n\nLet's break down the three approaches for the document.\n\n---\n\n**Document: clinton/general_election/clinton_2016_08_31.txt**\n\n**APPROACH 1: Evidence-First Analysis**\n\n*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**:\n    *   Score: 0.0, Salience: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0\n    *   Evidence: \"\"\n    *   Reasoning: No direct moral dichotomy between pure people and corrupt, self-serving elites.

Look where we are now. We have pulled the global economy out of free-fall thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people.\"\n    *   Reasoning: She frames a clear \"decline\" (\"no longer great\", \"global economy was collapsing\", \"allies less supportive\") and then presents a \"restoration\" narrative (\"Look where we are now.
