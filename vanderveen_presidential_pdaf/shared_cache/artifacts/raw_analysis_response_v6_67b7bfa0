I'll analyze the Hillary Clinton economic speech using three independent analytical approaches and then aggregate the results using median scores.

**APPROACH 1 - Evidence-First Analysis**: Focusing on direct textual evidence and explicit statements

**APPROACH 2 - Context-Weighted Analysis**: Emphasizing rhetorical context, structural positioning, and thematic centrality

**APPROACH 3 - Pattern-Based Analysis**: Looking for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis

After conducting all three independent analyses, I'll calculate median scores and select the best evidence.
