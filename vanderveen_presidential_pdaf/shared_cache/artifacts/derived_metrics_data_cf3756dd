She clearly contrasts her policies and values (for \"everyday Americans,\" \"working families\") with Trump and \"powerful special interests,\" \"the super-rich,\" \"Wall Street,\" which implies a dichotomy. However, it's less about \"pure people\" vs. \"corrupt elite\" morally, and more about \"those who work for everyone\" vs. \"those who work for themselves.\"\n    *   **Salience:** 0.7 - This framing is a consistent theme throughout the speech, especially in her direct comparisons with Trump.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.\" (Strong \"us vs them\" framing) and \"Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n*   **crisis_restoration_narrative:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.5 (Medium) - She acknowledges challenges (\"economic challenges,\" \"too much inequality\") and past failures (\"promised now ring hollow\"). She offers a path to restoration (\"build the kind of progress that America deserves to see,\" \"get back to doing that\") but it's more about improving existing systems rather than a catastrophic decline requiring radical redemption.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.6 - It's a recurring sub-theme, setting up her solutions.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"Those challenges emerged long before the Great Recession, and they have persisted through our recovery. There is too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today.\" (Crisis acknowledgement) and \"America's best days are still ahead of us if we make up our minds to actually go out and make that happen.\" (Restoration promise).\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n*   **popular_sovereignty_claims:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.2 (Minimal) - She uses phrases like \"the American people,\" but it's generally in the context of voters making a choice or beneficiaries of policy, not as a direct, unmediated political authority bypassing institutions. She emphasizes working with both parties and within the system.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.1 - Not a central theme.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"I hope the American people will ask of both candidates.\" (Voter choice, not supreme will)\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.2 (Minimal) - She strongly criticizes Trump but doesn't delegitimize him as an \"enemy of the people\" or suggest his views are illegitimate. She attributes gridlock to \"special interests\" and \"ideology\" rather than systemic opposition being inherently bad. She calls for working \"with both parties\" and finding \"common ground.\"\n    *   **Salience:** 0.1 - Minimal focus.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"I just don't think insults and bullying is how we're going to get things done.\" (Critiques style, not legitimacy of opponent) and \"I know it\u2019s hard to imagine, but there was a time when Democrats and Republicans actually worked together.\" (Advocates pluralism).\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.4 (Low-Medium) - She mentions \"powerful special interests\" and corporations benefiting from tax loopholes, implying some coordinated action. She critiques Trump for \"stiffing small businesses\" and not paying his fair share, painting him as part of a system that benefits the rich. However, it doesn't rise to the level of \"hidden networks\" or \"institutional capture\" conspiracies.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.5 - It's a recurring critique against Trump's economic policies.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress.\" and \"Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich, should finally pay their fair share of taxes.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n*   **authenticity_vs_political_class:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.7 (Medium-High) - She uses personal anecdotes (\"I am the product of the American middle class,\" \"my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill for 50 years,\" \"my Dad was able to go to college\") to establish her connection to \"everyday Americans\" and differentiate herself from Trump, who she claims doesn't understand \"working families.\" This explicitly positions her as authentic.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.7 - The personal story is a key rhetorical device used early in the speech to build ethos.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"This is personal for me. I am the product of the American middle class, I was born in Chicago, I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for 50 years.\" and \"I\u2019m the daughter of a small-business owner and the grand-daughter of a factory worker \u2013 and proud of both.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n*   **homogeneous_people_construction:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.5 (Medium) - She frequently uses \"we\" and \"us\" (e.g., \"we are all in this together,\" \"We are stronger together\") to construct a unified American identity, emphasizing shared goals and resilience. She aims to transcend divisions by focusing on common economic interests, but it doesn't explicitly erase class/regional/interest divisions.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.6 - \"Together\" is a frequent keyword and concept.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"If we do it together, we can all rise together. Because, you know what I like to say, we are stronger together, and that\u2019s why the fourth question is key.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n*   **nationalist_exclusion:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.3 (Low) - She promotes American strength and competitiveness (\"It's probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us!\"), but this is framed economically rather than culturally or ethnically exclusive. She contrasts American economic prowess with other countries in terms of clean energy jobs, not cultural purity. She mentions \"deporting millions of hard-working immigrants\" as a *negative* of Trump's plan.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.2 - Not a dominant theme.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It\u2019s probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us!\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n*   **economic_populist_appeals:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.9 (High) - The entire speech is an economic populist appeal. She frames economic issues as a conflict between \"working families\" and \"the top,\" \"Wall Street,\" \"corporations,\" promising to make the economy work for \"everyone\" and addressing \"inequality.\" She attacks Trump's economic plans as beneficial only to the rich. This aligns perfectly with the definition.\n    *   **Salience:** 1.0 - This is the central, overarching theme of the speech.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.\" and \"Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich, should finally pay their fair share of taxes.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n---\n**Approach 2: Context-Weighted Analysis**\n\n*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.7 (Medium-High) - The speech is structured around a clear dichotomy between Clinton's vision (for the many) and Trump's vision (for the few). Her persistent contrast with Trump, especially on economic policy and tax plans, reinforces this \"us vs. them\" moral framing. The rhetorical context places her as the champion of \"working families\" against an elite (Trump, Wall Street, corporations).\n    *   **Salience:** 0.8 - This framing underpins much of her policy discussion and attacks on Trump. It's a foundational rhetorical strategy.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.\" and \"Donald Trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself. I want to invest it in veterans, our kids, our police officers, and so much more.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n*   **crisis_restoration_narrative:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.6 (Medium) - The speech acknowledges significant economic challenges (\"too much inequality,\" \"it's just too hard to get ahead\") that are framed as requiring urgent action, implying a \"crisis.\" Her proposed policies are presented as \"restoring\" opportunity and a \"basic bargain\" that has been lost. The Detroit example (Midtown and Eastern Market \"coming back\") serves as a micro-narrative of restoration.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.7 - The narrative of decline and promised restoration of economic opportunity is a central thread that justifies her policy proposals.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"Those challenges emerged long before the Great Recession, and they have persisted through our recovery. There is too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today.\" and \"So here\u2019s what I want. I want every American family to be able to tell the same story. If you work hard, you do your part, you should be able to give your children all the opportunities they deserve. That is the basic bargain of America.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n*   **popular_sovereignty_claims:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.3 (Low) - While she frequently refers to \"the American people\" and what *they* want or need, this is primarily in the context of being responsive to public needs or empowering individuals through policies, not asserting direct popular will bypassing institutions. Her emphasis is on delivering results *through* government action and collaboration (\"work with both parties\").\n    *   **Salience:** 0.2 - \"The people\" are the beneficiaries, not the direct political actor.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"I want you to have a say in your government.\" (Empowerment, not direct sovereignty)\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.1 (Absent-Minimal) - This dimension is very low. Clinton explicitly calls for unity and working across the aisle (\"It\u2019s how we created the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program,\" \"get everyone at the table\"). She critiques Trump's *ideas* and *character* (\"insults and bullying\") but not the legitimacy of political opposition itself. Her rhetoric actively counters anti-pluralism.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.0 - Not present as a strategy.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"I know it\u2019s hard to imagine, but there was a time when Democrats and Republicans actually worked together.\" (Positive framing of pluralism).\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.5 (Medium) - She states \"powerful special interests... have led to gridlock in Congress\" and describes corporate outsourcing as deliberately structured (\"corporations should not abandon profitable operations here in the United States to move abroad, just to give shareholders a quicker return, CEOs a bigger bonus\"). This hints at systemic issues and coordination among elites for self-interest, though not a full-blown \"conspiracy.\"\n    *   **Salience:** 0.6 - This accusation against \"special interests\" and \"Wall Street\" is a recurring rhetorical tactic to justify her economic plans.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress.\" and \"Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich, should finally pay their fair share of taxes.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n*   **authenticity_vs_political_class:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.8 (High) - Her lengthy personal anecdote about her working-class background and family history, contrasted with Trump's business practices (stiffing small businesses), is a central rhetorical strategy to establish her as \"one of us\" and distinguish herself from the \"political class\" or \"wealthy elite.\" The \"product of the American middle class\" phrasing directly signals authenticity.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.8 - Positioned prominently early in the speech and revisited when attacking Trump, this theme is highly central.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"This is personal for me. I am the product of the American middle class, I was born in Chicago, I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for 50 years.\" and \"I\u2019m the daughter of a small-business owner and the grand-daughter of a factory worker \u2013 and proud of both.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n*   **homogeneous_people_construction:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.6 (Medium-High) - The repeated refrain \"We are stronger together,\" and emphasis on \"working together\" to achieve national goals, creates a strong sense of a unified, collective \"American people.\" She includes different groups (\"Democrats,\" \"Republicans,\" \"Independents,\" \"business,\" \"labor unions,\" \"academics,\" \"experts\") under this umbrella, transcending internal political divisions by focusing on shared values and economic prosperity.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.7 - \"Together\" is a consistent theme, especially towards the end, serving as a unifying call to action.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"If we can grow together, we can all rise together. Because, you know what I like to say, we are stronger together, and that\u2019s why the fourth question is key.\" and \"We are resilient, determined, hard-working. There is nothing America can\u2019t do \u2013 if we do it together.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n*   **nationalist_exclusion:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.2 (Minimal) - While she emphasizes American strength and competitiveness (\"America isn\u2019t afraid to compete\"), this is within an economic framework, not a cultural exclusionary one. Her criticism of China is about unfair trade practices, not inherent cultural inferiority. She rejects Trump's \"hide behind walls\" approach, signaling an anti-exclusionary stance on immigration (by mentioning \"deporting millions of hard-working immigrants\" as negative).\n    *   **Salience:** 0.1 - Very peripheral.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It\u2019s probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us!\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n*   **economic_populist_appeals:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.9 (High) - The entire speech is an extended economic argument framed through a populist lens. The central conflict is economic inequality and the fight for \"working families\" against corporate greed and the wealthy elite. Her policy proposals are all framed as benefiting the \"many\" over the \"few.\" This is the core message of the speech, strategically placed at the beginning and end, and woven throughout the comparisons with Trump.\n    *   **Salience:** 1.0 - The most salient dimension, the speech is fundamentally an economic populist appeal.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.\" and \"Donald Trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself. I want to invest it in veterans, our kids, our police officers, and so much more.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n---\n**Approach 3: Pattern-Based Analysis**\n\n*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.7 (Medium-High) - The \"everyone vs. those at the top\" framing is highly repetitive, appearing in her opening statement of purpose (\"make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top\"), throughout her critique of Trump's tax plan, and in her closing remarks. The consistent contrast with Trump's \"trickle-down\" ideas reinforces this binary.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.8 - The \"us vs. them\" (working families vs. the rich/special interests) is a recurring motif that structures the entire speech.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.\" and \"Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich, should finally pay their fair share of taxes.\" (Repeated calls for fair share).\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n*   **crisis_restoration_narrative:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.5 (Medium) - The pattern is \"problem-solution.\" She repeatedly highlights economic problems (\"too much inequality,\" \"jobs disappearing,\" \"factories closed\") and contrasts them with promises of \"restoration\" (\"comeback,\" \"build the future,\" \"get back to building\"). The phrase \"make America great again\" (from Trump, but implicitly countered) suggests a decline, and her agenda is the restoration.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.6 - This narrative arc (identifying problems, offering solutions) structures many of her policy points.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"There is too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today.\" (Problem repetition) and \"We are builders and we need to get back to building!\" (Restoration call).\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n*   **popular_sovereignty_claims:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.2 (Minimal) - Her appeals to \"the American people\" are consistently as beneficiaries or voters, not as an unmediated sovereign body. The rhetorical pattern is about *serving* the people, not direct rule by them.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.1 - Minimal. The pattern is about policy, not direct popular mandate.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"I want every American family to be able to tell the same story.\" (Focus on individual benefit, not collective will as ultimate authority).\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.1 (Absent-Minimal) - The rhetorical pattern is one of contrast with Trump's *policies* and *character*, not a rejection of political opposition itself. She advocates for bipartisan work and getting \"everyone at the table,\" which is contrary to anti-pluralism.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.0 - No significant pattern of exclusion.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"I just don\u2019t think insults and bullying is how we\u2019re going to get things done.\" (Rejects means, not legitimacy of opponent).\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.4 (Low-Medium) - She uses phrases like \"powerful special interests\" and \"lobbying for trade deals\" that imply systematic influence. Her father's story and Trump's business practices are used as illustrative anecdotes of \"the little guy\" being taken advantage of by \"the top.\" This repetitive pattern hints at a system rigged by elites.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.5 - This is a recurrent explanatory framework for economic problems.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress.\" and \"Too many companies lobbied for trade deals so they could sell products abroad but then they instead moved abroad and sold back into the United States.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n*   **authenticity_vs_political_class:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.8 (High) - The extensive personal narrative about her middle-class upbringing, factory worker grandfather, and small business owner father is a primary rhetorical pattern to establish her \"authenticity.\" This is directly contrasted with Trump's elite status and business practices (stiffing small businesses), creating a powerful \"us vs. him\" authenticity dynamic.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.8 - The personal story is heavily emphasized early on and directly linked to her policy motivations.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"This is personal for me. I am the product of the American middle class, I was born in Chicago, I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for 50 years.\" and \"I\u2019m the daughter of a small-business owner and the grand-daughter of a factory worker \u2013 and proud of both.\" (Repetitive self-identification).\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n*   **homogeneous_people_construction:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.6 (Medium-High) - The repeated phrase \"we are stronger together\" serves as a powerful unifying slogan. She uses \"we\" frequently to refer to all Americans, emphasizing shared destiny and collective action (\"if we do it together, we can all rise together\"). This pattern of collective identity transcends potential internal divisions.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.7 - \"Together\" is a highly repeated word, signaling unity and collective identity as a central theme.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"We are resilient, determined, hard-working. There is nothing America can\u2019t do \u2013 if we do it together.\" and \"If we can grow together, we can all rise together. Because, you know what I like to say, we are stronger together, and that\u2019s why the fourth question is key.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n*   **nationalist_exclusion:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.3 (Low) - The speech highlights American exceptionalism and desire to lead economically (\"I want it to be us! We invent the technology, we should make it and use it and export it\"), but this is a pattern of economic nationalism, not cultural exclusion. Her critique of Trump's \"hide behind walls\" also actively rejects a common nationalist-exclusionary pattern.\n    *   **Salience:** 0.2 - Not a dominant pattern, economic focus.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It\u2019s probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us!\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n*   **economic_populist_appeals:**\n    *   **Score:** 0.9 (High) - This is the dominant and most consistent pattern. The speech is built on economic policy proposals framed as benefiting the working class and small businesses, while consistently attacking Trump's plans as enriching the wealthy. Phrases like \"work for everyone, not just those at the top,\" \"fair share,\" \"economic justice\" are repeated and central to nearly every argument.\n    *   **Salience:** 1.0 - The most pervasive rhetorical pattern, defining the speech's core message.\n    *   **Evidence:** \"My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.\" and \"So many Americans have the talent and the will to succeed \u2014 whether they\u2019re kids right out of high school or older people displaced by automation and outsourcing.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n---\n**Aggregation Step**\n\nNow, calculate medians and select best evidence.\n\n**Dimension Scores from each approach:**\n\n| Dimension                             | Approach 1 (Evid-First) | Approach 2 (Context-Weighted) | Approach 3 (Pattern-Based) | Median Raw Score | Median Salience | Median Confidence |\n| :------------------------------------ | :---------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------- | :--------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- |\n| `manichaean_people_elite_framing`     | R:0.6, S:0.7, C:0.8     | R:0.7, S:0.8, C:0.9             | R:0.7, S:0.8, C:0.9        | 0.7              | 0.8             | 0.9               |\n| `crisis_restoration_narrative`        | R:0.5, S:0.6, C:0.8     | R:0.6, S:0.7, C:0.9             | R:0.5, S:0.6, C:0.8        | 0.5              | 0.6             | 0.8               |\n| `popular_sovereignty_claims`          | R:0.2, S:0.1, C:0.7     | R:0.3, S:0.2, C:0.8             | R:0.2, S:0.1, C:0.7        | 0.2              | 0.1             | 0.7               |\n| `anti_pluralist_exclusion`            | R:0.2, S:0.1, C:0.8     | R:0.1, S:0.0, C:0.9             | R:0.1, S:0.0, C:0.9        | 0.1              | 0.0             | 0.9               |\n| `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption`| R:0.4, S:0.5, C:0.7     | R:0.5, S:0.6, C:0.8             | R:0.4, S:0.5, C:0.7        | 0.4              | 0.5             | 0.7               |\n| `authenticity_vs_political_class`     | R:0.7, S:0.7, C:0.9     | R:0.8, S:0.8, C:0.9             | R:0.8, S:0.8, C:0.9        | 0.8              | 0.8             | 0.9               |\n| `homogeneous_people_construction`     | R:0.5, S:0.6, C:0.8     | R:0.6, S:0.7, C:0.9             | R:0.6, S:0.7, C:0.9        | 0.6              | 0.7             | 0.9               |\n| `nationalist_exclusion`               | R:0.3, S:0.2, C:0.7     | R:0.2, S:0.1, C:0.8             | R:0.3, S:0.2, C:0.7        | 0.3              | 0.2             | 0.7               |\n| `economic_populist_appeals`           | R:0.9, S:1.0, C:1.0     | R:0.9, S:1.0, C:1.0             | R:0.9, S:1.0, C:1.0        | 0.9              | 1.0             | 1.0               |\n\n**Best Evidence Selection (based on highest confidence or most representative):**\n\n*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing:** \"My mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.\" (From Approach 1 and 3, very representative)\n*   **crisis_restoration_narrative:** \"Those challenges emerged long before the Great Recession, and they have persisted through our recovery.

Score dimensions based on direct quotes.\n    *   **Approach 2: Context-Weighted Analysis:** Consider the rhetorical context, structural positioning (e.g., introduction, conclusion, central themes), and thematic centrality of each dimension within the speech.\n    *   **Approach 3: Pattern-Based Analysis:** Look for repetition of keywords, rhetorical devices (metaphors, analogies), and strategic emphasis through frequency or rhetorical intensity.\n\n    For each approach, for each dimension:\n    *   Assign a `raw_score` (0.0-1.0).\n    *   Assign a `salience` score (0.0-1.0).\n    *   Assign a `confidence` score (0.0-1.0).\n    *   Extract the most relevant `evidence` quote.

The title \"American Exceptionalism\" suggests a focus on American strength, global leadership, and national identity. It's probably less about traditional 'people vs. elite' populism and more about national unity, competence, and global role. There will likely be contrasts with an \"opponent\" (Trump) who might represent a different view of American strength or alliances.\n\n*   **Expected Dimension Scores (Initial Hypothesis based on Title/Topic):**\n    *   `manichaean_people_elite_framing`: Low, Clinton typically doesn't frame in this way.\n    *   `crisis_restoration_narrative`: Moderate. There might be a sense of current challenges needing restoration, but probably not framed as a deep betrayal. She contrasts her vision with an opponent's \"wrong\" view, implying some crisis.\n    *   `popular_sovereignty_claims`: Low. Focus more on institutional processes, leadership, and alliances rather than direct popular will bypassing institutions.\n    *   `anti_pluralist_exclusion`: Low. Clinton emphasizes unity and working with both parties. She criticizes her opponent, but likely not to the point of denying their legitimacy entirely.\n    *   `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption`: Very low. Not her typical rhetorical style.\n    *   `authenticity_vs_political_class`: Low. She is a quintessential political insider. Will likely emphasize experience and competence.\n    *   `homogeneous_people_construction`: High. Expect strong appeals to national unity, transcending divisions, especially when discussing the military.\n    *   `nationalist_exclusion`: Moderate to High. \"American Exceptionalism\" is inherently nationalistic. She will likely emphasize American uniqueness and leadership, possibly contrasting with external threats (Russia, ISIS).\n    *   `economic_populist_appeals`: Low. The speech seems focused on foreign policy/military, not domestic economic grievances.\n\nLet's break down the three approaches for the document.\n\n---\n\n**Document: clinton/general_election/clinton_2016_08_31.txt**\n\n**APPROACH 1: Evidence-First Analysis**\n\n*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**:\n    *   Score: 0.0, Salience: 0.0, Confidence: 1.0\n    *   Evidence: \"\"\n    *   Reasoning: No direct moral dichotomy between pure people and corrupt, self-serving elites.

Each analysis should score all nine dimensions (intensity, salience, confidence) and provide textual evidence.\n    *   **Approach 1: \"Evidence-First Analysis\"**: Prioritize explicit statements and clear indicators.\n    *   **Approach 2: \"Context-Weighted Analysis\"**: Emphasize rhetorical context, structural positioning, and thematic centrality.\n    *   **Approach 3: \"Pattern-Based Analysis\"**: Look for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis.\n3.  **Aggregate the results:**\n    *   Calculate the **median** raw_score and salience for each dimension across the three approaches.\n    *   Select the **best evidence quote** for each dimension from the three approaches (highest confidence or most representative).\n    *   The confidence score for the aggregated result will be the average of the confidence scores from the three approaches for that dimension. (No, the prompt says confidence is `[0.0-1.0 scoring confidence]` for the final aggregated result, suggesting an overall confidence in the *scoring* of that dimension, which is typically derived from the average or median of the individual approach confidences. Let's use the median for consistency with raw_score and salience, or average for general overall confidence.

The constant repetition of \"we're going to win again,\" \"make our country great again,\" etc., especially at the end, structurally reinforces the restoration promise.\n    *   raw_score: 0.9 (The crisis is presented as severe and widespread.)\n    *   salience: 1.0 (It's the overarching rhetorical strategy, giving purpose to his campaign and policy promises.)\n    *   confidence: 1.0 (Absolutely central and pervasive.)\n\n*   **popular_sovereignty_claims**: His discussion of polling booth lines and \"people that never voted before\" is positioned as key evidence of a new, direct popular mandate, contrasting with the \"ridiculous\" old political math. This emphasis on mass mobilization (\"millions of people are coming in to vote\") is thematically central to his claim of legitimacy and power.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong claims of popular authority through direct voter action.)\n    *   salience: 0.8 (High prominence, structurally highlighted by anecdotes about long lines and new voters.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Clear contextual emphasis.)\n\n*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion**: The dismissal of negative advertising as \"mostly false, vicious, horrible\" and his inability to \"understand\" why his numbers went up despite it, is a rhetorical move to delegitimize any opposition. By framing critics as \"disgusting reporters, horrible people,\" he seeks to exclude their views from legitimate political discourse. This is thematically consistent with his \"winning\" narrative.\n    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Delegitimization is present but slightly less explicit than in Approach 1.)\n    *   salience: 0.7 (This delegitimization of opposition, particularly media, features prominently in several segments.)\n    *   confidence: 0.8 (The strategic dismissal of criticism is clear.)\n\n*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption**: While not explicitly using the word \"conspiracy,\" the framing of negative ads as a coordinated, well-funded, \"brutal\" campaign \"in waves one after another\" against him suggests a systemic, almost conspiratorial effort by \"them.\" This forms a thematic counter-narrative to his own popular surge, implying that \"they\" (unnamed forces) are working against the popular will.\n    *   raw_score: 0.7 (The systemic nature is strongly implied through the description of the attacks.)\n    *   salience: 0.7 (The extensive description of the negative ads gives this theme significant prominence, especially the anecdotes about the Doral golf tournament.)\n    *   confidence: 0.8 (The context strongly points to perceived coordinated action.)\n\n*   **authenticity_vs_political_class**: Trump positions himself as a deal-maker and someone who understands \"basic physics\" and \"mathematics\" when \"these people\" (politicians/media) don't. His personal anecdotes (family, Mar-a-Lago, \"came down the escalator\") are used to present a relatable, non-political persona. This contrasts implicitly with the \"gross incompetence at the highest level\" he attributes to traditional politicians. This self-presentation is pervasive.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Consistent self-framing as an authentic outsider.)\n    *   salience: 0.8 (Pervasive, intertwined with his criticism of elites and claims of competence.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Strong rhetorical strategy.)\n\n*   **homogeneous_people_construction**: The repeated anecdotes about massive voter turnout, including Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters, serves to construct a broad, undifferentiated \"people\" united by a desire for change. This rhetorical construction simplifies complex demographics into a single, powerful \"will of the people.\" Thematic centrality is high in reinforcing his mandate.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on unifying elements.)\n    *   salience: 0.7 (The stories of voter turnout are a key part of his victory narrative.)\n    *   confidence: 0.8 (Clear and consistently used.)\n\n*   **nationalist_exclusion**: The focus on \"borders,\" \"companies leaving our country,\" and \"we don't win anymore\" against specific foreign entities (China, Vietnam, Japan, Mexico, India) are structurally central to his policy positions. This rhetorical strategy clearly defines an in-group (USA/Americans) and an out-group (foreign competitors/threats), justifying protectionist and nationalistic policies.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong and explicit nationalist framing.)\n    *   salience: 0.8 (Central to his argument for economic change and national security.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Highly apparent.)\n\n*   **economic_populist_appeals**: This is perhaps the most contextually central theme. The \"crisis\" he identifies (companies leaving, bad trade deals) is primarily economic, and his \"restoration\" promises (making companies stay, good deals, \"make our country rich again\") are also economic. He consistently blames the current economic decline on the incompetence of the political establishment.\n    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Economic issues are presented as fundamental problems requiring populist solutions.)\n    *   salience: 1.0 (The entire rationale for his candidacy and vision is deeply rooted in economic grievances and proposed solutions.)\n    *   confidence: 1.0 (Pervasive and undeniably central.)\n\n---\n**Approach 3: Pattern-Based Analysis**\n\nLook for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis.\n\n*   **manichaean_people_elite_framing**: Repetition of phrases like \"gross incompetence at the highest level,\" \"ridiculous,\" \"disgusting reporters, horrible people.\" Use of personal anecdotes to highlight difference: \"I have to explain to these people they don\u2019t understand...\" This pattern of dismissing opponents' intellect or morality recurs.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Consistent verbal attacks on elites.)\n    *   salience: 0.8 (The recurring insults and framing of critics as \"horrible\" or \"disgusting\" makes this highly salient.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Strong patterns of elite-blaming.)\n\n*   **crisis_restoration_narrative**: Heavy repetition of \"we don't win anymore\" (at least 4 times), \"make our country great again,\" \"start winning again.\" The narrative structure consistently moves from current failures (companies leaving, bad deals, weak military, neglected veterans, \"disasters\" like Paris) to future victory through his leadership. This cyclical pattern is a core rhetorical device.\n    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Repeated phrases and narrative structure confirm the intensity.)\n    *   salience: 1.0 (The most pronounced rhetorical pattern, central to the speech's message.)\n    *   confidence: 1.0 (Undeniable pattern.)\n\n*   **popular_sovereignty_claims**: Emphasis through vivid descriptions and numerical claims: \"Millions of people are coming in to vote,\" \"lines are four, five, six blocks long,\" \"people that never voted before.\" The \"53%\" poll anecdote is used to reframe traditional political analysis, asserting popular will as supreme. This pattern emphasizes popular uprising over institutional process.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on quantity and impact of popular support.)\n    *   salience: 0.7 (The concrete examples of voter turnout serve to highlight this.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Clear rhetorical patterns reinforce this.)\n\n*   **anti_pluralist_exclusion**: Repetition of \"vicious,\" \"horrible,\" \"mostly false\" to describe negative advertising and \"disgusting reporters.\" The rhetorical effect is to systematically invalidate dissenting voices or opposition tactics. The phrase \"What a disaster\" is applied to political attacks, equating opposition with catastrophe.\n    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Use of strong negative adjectives to describe opposition.)\n    *   salience: 0.6 (Prominent in his responses to criticism, creating a pattern of dismissal.)\n    *   confidence: 0.7 (The patterned dismissal is clear.)\n\n*   **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption**: The repeated descriptions of negative ads coming \"in waves one after another after another\" and being \"brutal\" and \"disaster\" creates a pattern of an overwhelming, coordinated, and illegitimate attack. While not explicitly naming a conspiracy, the consistent framing implies a concerted effort by \"them.\"\n    *   raw_score: 0.6 (Implied through consistent negative framing of opposition activities.)\n    *   salience: 0.6 (The extended anecdote about the negative ads and the golf tournament highlights this patterned attack.)\n    *   confidence: 0.7 (Pattern of describing organized, negative campaigns.)\n\n*   **authenticity_vs_political_class**: Self-referential statements like \"I'm working very hard,\" \"I'm not a politician,\" and focusing on his business background. Contrasting his ability to \"make a deal in 10 minutes\" with politicians who \"can't get along\" is a repeated rhetorical juxtaposition. The frequent use of \"I\" when talking about solutions positions him as the unique, authentic actor.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Consistent self-presentation as an authentic outsider.)\n    *   salience: 0.7 (Pervasive through personal anecdotes and direct comparisons.)\n    *   confidence: 0.8 (Clear rhetorical positioning.)\n\n*   **homogeneous_people_construction**: The inclusive language when describing voters (\"Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and... people that never voted before\") creates a unified image of \"the people.\" The collective \"we\" (\"We have so, so many great people\") reinforces this homogeneity, emphasizing shared identity over division.\n    *   raw_score: 0.7 (Consistent use of inclusive and unifying language for his supporters.)\n    *   salience: 0.6 (The descriptions of voter turnout provide strong examples.)\n    *   confidence: 0.7 (Clear patterns of unifying language.)\n\n*   **nationalist_exclusion**: Repetition of \"in the United States, not in China, Vietnam...\" and listing multiple countries (\"China, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India\"). The recurring theme of \"borders\" and \"protection in our country\" defines the in-group (\"our country\") against foreign out-groups. The \"we don't win anymore\" applies specifically to international relations.\n    *   raw_score: 0.8 (Strong, consistent pattern of identifying foreign threats and emphasizing national protection.)\n    *   salience: 0.8 (Highly repetitive and central to his policy arguments.)\n    *   confidence: 0.9 (Clear and consistent pattern.)\n\n*   **economic_populist_appeals**: High frequency of economic terms (\"companies leaving,\" \"trade deals,\" \"taxes,\" \"money back into the country,\" \"rich again\"). The repeated phrases \"we don't win anymore\" and \"make our country rich again\" are directly tied to economic grievances and solutions, forming a dominant rhetorical pattern.\n    *   raw_score: 0.9 (Very high frequency of economic themes.)\n    *   salience: 1.0 (The most frequent and dominant rhetorical pattern throughout the speech.)\n    *   confidence: 1.0 (Pervasive and undeniable.)\n\n---\n**Summary of Scores per Approach:**\n\n**Dimension Scores:**\n\n| Dimension                             | Approach 1 (Evidence-First) | Approach 2 (Context-Weighted) | Approach 3 (Pattern-Based) |\n| :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------- |\n| **manichaean_people_elite_framing**   | R: 0.9, S: 0.8, C: 0.9      | R: 0.8, S: 0.9, C: 0.9        | R: 0.8, S: 0.8, C: 0.9      |\n| **crisis_restoration_narrative**      | R: 0.9, S: 0.9, C: 1.0      | R: 0.9, S: 1.0, C: 1.0        | R: 0.9, S: 1.0, C: 1.0      |\n| **popular_sovereignty_claims**        | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.9      | R: 0.8, S: 0.8, C: 0.9        | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.9      |\n| **anti_pluralist_exclusion**          | R: 0.7, S: 0.6, C: 0.8      | R: 0.7, S: 0.7, C: 0.8        | R: 0.7, S: 0.6, C: 0.7      |\n| **elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption** | R: 0.7, S: 0.6, C: 0.7      | R: 0.7, S: 0.7, C: 0.8        | R: 0.6, S: 0.6, C: 0.7      |\n| **authenticity_vs_political_class**   | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.8      | R: 0.8, S: 0.8, C: 0.9        | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.8      |\n| **homogeneous_people_construction**   | R: 0.7, S: 0.6, C: 0.8      | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.8        | R: 0.7, S: 0.6, C: 0.7      |\n| **nationalist_exclusion**             | R: 0.8, S: 0.7, C: 0.9      | R: 0.8, S: 0.8, C: 0.9        | R: 0.8, S: 0.8, C: 0.9      |\n| **economic_populist_appeals**         | R: 0.9, S: 0.9, C: 1.0      | R: 0.9, S: 1.0, C: 1.0        | R: 0.9, S: 1.0, C: 1.0      |\n\n---\n**Calculate Medians and Select Best Evidence:**\n\nFor each dimension, list the scores from the three approaches (R, S, C) and pick the median.
