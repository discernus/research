      "impact": "While the current system may parse this structure, it is non-compliant with the v10.0 specification and may cause failures in stricter or future versions of the platform. It relies on undocumented or deprecated behavior.",
      "fix": "Refactor the `required_calculations` object into a `derived_metrics` list. Each metric (including intermediate calculations like `emotional_cohesion_component`) should be an item in this list with `name`, `description`, and `formula` keys, as documented in the v10.0 Framework Specification.",

      "description": "The formulas for the final cohesion indices (`descriptive_cohesion_index`, `motivational_cohesion_index`, `full_cohesion_index`) are not self-contained. They reference other derived metrics as variables (e.g., `emotional_cohesion_component`), which requires the execution engine to correctly resolve a dependency graph.",
      "impact": "This could lead to calculation errors if the execution order is not guaranteed or if the formula engine does not support variable substitution from other derived metrics. It reduces the robustness and portability of the framework.",
      "fix": "For final indices, provide the fully expanded, self-contained formula that directly references the base dimensional scores (e.g., `((hope.raw_score * hope.salience) - (fear.raw_score * fear.salience)) + ...`) instead of relying on intermediate component names.",
