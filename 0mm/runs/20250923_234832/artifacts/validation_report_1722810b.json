      "description": "The framework's machine-readable appendix uses the top-level key `required_calculations` to define all derived metrics. The Framework Specification v10.0, which this framework declares compliance with, specifies that optional derived metrics should be defined under a key named `derived_metrics`. While the logic within `required_calculations` is sound and internally consistent with the `output_schema`, a strict parser adhering to the v10.0 specification might not recognize the `required_calculations` key, leading it to ignore these essential definitions.",
      "impact": "If the system's parser strictly expects a `derived_metrics` key, it may fail to process the 21 metric definitions provided. This would result in the `derived_metrics` section of the final analysis output being empty, and the experiment would fail to produce the composite indices (e.g., `full_cohesion_index`) central to its research questions.",
      "fix": "To ensure compliance and prevent potential parsing failures, rename the top-level key `required_calculations` to `derived_metrics` and restructure its contents into a flat list of metric objects. Each object in the list should contain `name`, `description`, and `formula` keys. For example, `required_calculations.tension_indices.identity_tension` would become an object in the `derived_metrics` list with `name: \"identity_tension\"`.",
