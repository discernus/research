Any law that degrades human personality is unjust.]\",\n  \"[individual_dignity: Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an \\\"I it\\\" relationship for an \\\"I thou\\\" relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things.]\",\n  \"[individual_dignity: all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality.]\",\n  \"[fear: But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters;]\",\n  \"[fear: when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society;]\",\n  \"[fear: ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky... plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of 'nobodiness'--then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait.]\",\n  \"[hope: radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.]\",\n  \"[hope: I have no despair about the future.
