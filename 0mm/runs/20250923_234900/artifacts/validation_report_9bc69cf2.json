      "description": "The 'default' analysis variant prompt in `framework.md` incorrectly instructs the LLM to return `derived_metrics`, which are designed to be computed by the Discernus calculation engine post-analysis, not by the LLM itself. The prompt states: \"The derived_metrics are calculated automatically based on your dimensional scores, but you must include both sections in your JSON output.\" This instruction is contradictory and misassigns the calculation task to the language model.",
      "impact": "This instruction may confuse the LLM, leading it to hallucinate incorrect values for the derived metrics, perform the calculations with errors, or fail to respond correctly. This bypasses the platform's validated calculation engine and makes the derived metric results unreliable.",
      "fix": "Modify the `analysis_prompt` for the 'default' variant in `framework.md`. Remove the section \"MANDATORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS: You must provide both dimensional_scores AND derived_metrics in your response. The derived_metrics are calculated automatically based on your dimensional scores, but you must include both sections in your JSON output.\" The LLM's task should be strictly limited to producing the `dimensional_scores`. The system orchestrator is responsible for calculating the `derived_metrics` based on the framework's formulas.",
