Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation.]\",\n  \"[FEAR: But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters;]\",\n  \"[FEAR: millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood.
