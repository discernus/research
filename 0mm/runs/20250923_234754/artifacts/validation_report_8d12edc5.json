      "description": "The 'default' analysis variant prompt in `framework.md` requires the LLM to output `derived_metrics`, while simultaneously stating they are 'calculated automatically'. The output schema also mandates these complex calculated fields be returned as numbers by the LLM. This creates a significant risk of the LLM attempting to perform multi-step calculations in-line with its qualitative analysis, which can lead to inaccuracies or task failure.",
      "impact": "Execution may fail if the LLM cannot satisfy the complex output schema. If it does produce the derived metrics, the values may be inaccurate as they bypass the system's validated calculation engine, compromising the integrity of the results. The requested model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) may be capable of this, but it is not a robust or reliable workflow.",
      "fix": "Modify the `analysis_variants.default.analysis_prompt` to instruct the LLM to focus exclusively on producing the `dimensional_scores`. The system orchestrator should be responsible for all `derived_metrics` calculations after receiving the raw scores. The LLM output validation should only apply to the `dimensional_scores` block, with the full schema being validated after the system performs the required calculations.",
