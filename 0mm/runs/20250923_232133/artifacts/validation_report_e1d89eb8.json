      "description": "The 'default' analysis variant prompt in 'framework.md' instructs the LLM to include a 'derived_metrics' section in its output, while also stating these metrics are calculated automatically. This instruction is contradictory and could confuse the analysis agent.",
      "impact": "The LLM might attempt to hallucinate values for the 'derived_metrics' block, leading to incorrect or non-reproducible results. The expected workflow is for the LLM to provide only 'dimensional_scores', with the system performing the derived calculations afterwards based on the 'required_calculations' section.",
      "fix": "In 'framework.md', modify the 'analysis_prompt' for the 'default' variant. Remove the sentence: 'MANDATORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS: You must provide both dimensional_scores AND derived_metrics in your response. The derived_metrics are calculated automatically based on your dimensional scores, but you must include both sections in your JSON output.' The prompt should only require the LLM to produce the 'dimensional_scores' object.",

    "The experiment is well-structured for a comparative case analysis (N=2), correctly focusing on descriptive comparison rather than inferential statistics, which would be inappropriate for this sample size. The setup is coherent and compliant with platform standards.",
    "The use of the 'speaker' field in the corpus manifest as a grouping variable for the comparative analysis is a good practice and aligns with the v10.0 experiment specification requirements."
