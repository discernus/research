      "description": "The framework's machine-readable appendix defines calculations under a custom `required_calculations` key with a nested structure. The Framework v10.0 specification dictates these should be defined under a `derived_metrics` key as a flat list of objects, each with `name`, `description`, and `formula` keys.",
      "impact": "While the nested structure is well-organized, it deviates from the v10.0 standard. Execution environments that strictly parse for the `derived_metrics` key and list structure may fail to identify and perform the calculations. This will not cause a crash but may result in missing derived metrics in the final output if the execution engine is not flexible.",
      "fix": "To ensure full compliance with the v10.0 specification, refactor the `required_calculations` nested object into a flat list under the key `derived_metrics`. The calculation order can be preserved by defining components first in the list. For example: `derived_metrics:\n  - name: \"identity_tension\"\n    description: \"...\"\n    formula: \"min(tribal_dominance.raw_score, individual_dignity.raw_score) * abs(tribal_dominance.salience - individual_dignity.salience)\"\n  - name: \"emotional_tension\"\n    description: \"...\"\n    formula: \"...\"`",

    "The overall experiment design is exceptionally coherent. The alignment between the research questions, the N=2 corpus, the choice of a comparative case study methodology, and the detailed framework specification is a model of best practice."
