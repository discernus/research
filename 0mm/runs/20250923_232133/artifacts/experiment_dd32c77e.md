# Civil Rights Rhetoric Comparison: Malcolm X vs. Martin Luther King Jr.

## Experiment Overview

This experiment conducts a comparative case analysis of the rhetorical strategies of two iconic civil rights leaders using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 to examine how different approaches to social change manifest in discourse patterns related to cohesion and democratic health.

## Research Questions

### Primary Research Question

How do the rhetorical strategies of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. differ in their approach to social cohesion and democratic discourse, as revealed through comparative case analysis using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework?

### Secondary Research Questions

1. **Identity Framing**: What evidence exists for different approaches to tribal dominance versus individual dignity appeals in each leader's discourse?
2. **Emotional Climate**: What patterns emerge in fear-based versus hope-based messaging between the two approaches?
3. **Success Orientation**: How do the leaders differ in their framing of envy versus mudita toward others' achievements?
4. **Relational Climate**: What evidence exists for different enmity versus amity positioning in their discourse?
5. **Goal Orientation**: How do their objectives differ in terms of fragmentative versus cohesive goals?
6. **Strategic Coherence**: What evidence exists for different levels of rhetorical consistency and coherence between the approaches?

## Comparative Expectations

### E1: Identity Dimension Analysis

Malcolm X's discourse is expected to show more evidence of tribal dominance appeals, emphasizing black nationalism and group solidarity, while MLK's discourse is expected to show more evidence of individual dignity appeals, emphasizing universal human worth and inclusive recognition.

### E2: Emotional Climate Analysis

Malcolm X's discourse is expected to demonstrate more evidence of fear-based messaging (crisis mentality, existential threats) while MLK's discourse is expected to show more evidence of hope-based messaging (progress orientation, optimistic vision).

### E3: Success Orientation Analysis

Malcolm X's discourse is expected to show more evidence of envy patterns (resentment toward white success, zero-sum thinking) while MLK's discourse is expected to demonstrate more evidence of mudita (celebration of others' achievements, abundance mindset).

### E4: Relational Climate Analysis

Malcolm X's discourse is expected to show more evidence of enmity positioning (hostility, adversarial framing) while MLK's discourse is expected to show more evidence of amity appeals (friendship appeals, cooperative framing).

### E5: Goal Orientation Analysis

Malcolm X's discourse is expected to demonstrate more evidence of fragmentative goals (divisive objectives, separation emphasis) while MLK's discourse is expected to show more evidence of cohesive goals (integrative objectives, unity building).

### E6: Cohesion Index Analysis

MLK's discourse is expected to produce higher cohesion indices across all three levels (descriptive, motivational, and full cohesion) compared to Malcolm X's approach, based on the framework's analytical criteria.

## Methodology

### Framework

- **Framework**: Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4
- **Analysis Variant**: Default variant (complete v10.4 implementation with salience and tension analysis)
- **Model Requirements**: Gemini 2.5 Pro for sophisticated dual-track analysis

### Analytical Approach

1. **Comprehensive Dimensional Analysis**: All ten dimensions across five opposing pairs will be analyzed using the CFF v10.4 framework
2. **Salience-Weighted Scoring**: Both intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience (0.0-1.0) will be measured for each dimension
3. **Tension Analysis**: Strategic contradictions will be calculated using the framework's tension formulas
4. **Cohesion Index Calculation**: Three levels of cohesion indices will be computed with salience weighting
5. **Comparative Case Analysis**: Descriptive comparison of the two approaches across all framework dimensions

### Expected Outcomes

- **Dimensional Scores**: Individual dimensional scores, tension indices, and cohesion indices for both texts
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Evidence-based assessment of rhetorical strategies and their implications
- **Comparative Analysis**: Descriptive comparison of the two approaches across all framework dimensions
- **Case Study Insights**: Detailed examination of how each leader's rhetorical approach manifests across the framework dimensions

## Significance

This experiment addresses a critical question in civil rights history: how do different rhetorical approaches to social change manifest in discourse patterns related to community cohesion and democratic discourse? The findings will contribute to understanding:

1. **Historical Analysis**: Comparative case study of two major civil rights philosophies
2. **Discourse Theory**: How rhetorical strategies manifest in patterns related to social cohesion and democratic health
3. **Strategic Communication**: Implications for contemporary social movements and political discourse

## Definition of Done

The experiment will be considered complete when:

1. Both speeches have been analyzed using the CFF v10.4 framework
2. All dimensional scores, salience weights, and derived metrics have been calculated
3. Comparative case analysis between the two texts has been performed
4. A comprehensive synthesis report has been generated with findings, implications, and limitations
5. Evidence-based assessment of rhetorical strategies has been documented
6. All artifacts have been properly stored with full provenance
