Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we're getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over.]\",\n  \"[CRISIS_RESTORATION_TEMPORAL_NARRATIVE: As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.]\",\n  \"[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams.]\",\n  \"[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Americans love their country, and they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.]\",\n  \"[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this Chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream.]\",\n  \"[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people.]\",\n  \"[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Tonight I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country.]\",\n  \"[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield, including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released.]\",\n  \"[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth.]\",\n  \"[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem.]\",\n  \"[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.]\",\n  \"[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.]\",\n  \"[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I asked C.J., \\\"What's the secret?\\\" He said, \\\"We're just tougher than they are.\\\" And I like that answer.]\",\n  \"[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.]\",\n  \"[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: make America great again for all Americans.]\",\n  \"[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.]\",\n  \"[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: The people dreamed this country, the people built this country, and it's the people who are making America great again.]\",\n  \"[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.]\",\n  \"[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep our communities safe.]\",\n  \"[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people. It's time to begin moving toward a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.]\",\n  \"[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. And something I'm very proud of: African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.]\",\n  \"[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans.]\",\n  \"[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it's very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially.
