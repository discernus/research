# Populist Discourse Case Study Analysis: Presidential Speech Patterns Across Time and Context

## Abstract

This experiment analyzes populist discourse patterns in presidential speeches using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. The analysis employs a case study approach examining speech patterns across different contexts spanning 2017-2025. The corpus includes 6 presidential speeches representing different speech types and time periods, enabling comprehensive case study analysis of populist discourse evolution and contextual variation.

## Research Questions

1. What patterns exist in populist discourse dimensions across presidential speeches?
2. What relationships exist between temporal factors and populist discourse measures?
3. How do populist discourse patterns vary across different speech contexts?
4. What patterns exist between populist anchor dimensions and strategic tension measures?

## Expected Outcomes

This experiment will produce empirical findings on temporal discourse effects, strategic coherence patterns, anchor relationship patterns, and speech context effects. The analysis will include case study analysis of temporal patterns, multi-evaluation reliability, populist dimension clustering, strategic tension analysis, speech context analysis, and reliability analysis.

## Methodology

### Framework
**Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0** provides:
- 9-dimensional populist anchor analysis across core, mechanism, and boundary dimensions
- Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) for strategic coherence measurement
- JSON-first architecture with enhanced synthesis integration
- Strategic tension mathematics for contradiction quantification

### Corpus Design
6 presidential speeches spanning 2017-2025:

**Early Presidential Period (2017)**:
- Inaugural Address (foundational presidential rhetoric)
- Joint Session Address (early policy vision)

**Mid-Presidential Period (2018-2020)**:
- State of the Union 2018 (annual presidential communication)
- State of the Union 2019 (annual presidential communication)
- State of the Union 2020 (annual presidential communication)

**Recent Presidential Period (2025)**:
- State of the Union 2025 (recent presidential communication)

**Temporal Balance**: 6 speeches across 3 time periods, enabling temporal pattern analysis and speech context comparison.

### Enhanced Statistical Analysis
- **Temporal pattern analysis**: Case study analysis of dimension patterns across time periods
- **Multi-evaluation reliability**: 3 independent assessments per document (N=18 total evaluations)
- **Populist dimension clustering**: Anchor profile similarities within/across speeches
- **Strategic tension analysis**: Relationships between PSCI and populist intensity measures
- **Speech context analysis**: Comparative analysis of speech types and contexts
- **Reliability analysis**: PSCI consistency patterns across speeches and evaluations

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Statistical Analysis Results**: Quantified patterns in populist discourse dimensions across experimental factors
2. **Temporal Pattern Analysis**: Statistical tests for populist discourse patterns across time periods
3. **Strategic Tension Analysis**: Relationships between PSCI and populist anchor dimensions
4. **Context Comparison Analysis**: Statistical differences between speech contexts and types
5. **Factorial Design Validation**: Technical validation of populist discourse analysis capabilities

## Significance

This experiment provides systematic computational analysis of populist discourse patterns using factorial experimental design in presidential rhetoric. The temporal structure will produce empirical findings on:

1. **Temporal discourse effects**: Whether populist dimensions show systematic changes across time periods
2. **Strategic coherence patterns**: Whether PSCI measures correlate with temporal or contextual factors  
3. **Anchor relationship patterns**: Whether populist discourse dimensions show systematic correlational structures
4. **Speech context effects**: Whether different speech contexts produce distinct populist discourse patterns

The factorial design provides comprehensive validation of populist discourse analysis while testing the platform's ability to detect complex statistical relationships in political communication patterns across multiple time periods and speech contexts.
