However, the provided scores for the tension dimensions in the CSV are directly calculated as the absolute difference. The framework's calculation section states: `mc_sci: \"(dignity_tribalism_tension + truth_manipulation_tension + justice_resentment_tension + hope_fear_tension + pragmatism_fantasy_tension) / 5\"`. This implies the tension scores themselves are the inputs. The provided CSV output for `dignity_tribalism_tension` etc. are the calculated tensions. Therefore, the MC-SCI calculation is correct based on the provided framework's formula and the calculated tension values.*\n\n    *Re-evaluating the MC-SCI calculation based on the provided CSV output for the tension dimensions:*\n    *   dignity_tribalism_tension = 0.5\n    *   truth_manipulation_tension = 0.3\n    *   justice_resentment_tension = 0.4\n    *   hope_fear_tension = 0.6\n    *   pragmatism_fantasy_tension = 0.6\n    *   MC-SCI = (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.6 + 0.6) / 5 = 2.4 / 5 = 0.48\n\n    *The framework's output contract for the scores CSV includes `mc_sci`. The calculated value is 0.48. The provided CSV output has `0.46`. There is a slight discrepancy. Let's re-examine the individual scores and recalculate the tensions to ensure accuracy.*\n\n    *   Dignity: 0.7, Tribalism: 0.2 -> Tension = |0.7 - 0.2| = 0.5\n    *   Truth: 0.6, Manipulation: 0.3 -> Tension = |0.6 - 0.3| = 0.3\n    *   Justice: 0.5, Resentment: 0.1 -> Tension = |0.5 - 0.1| = 0.4\n    *   Hope: 0.8, Fear: 0.2 -> Tension = |0.8 - 0.2| = 0.6\n    *   Pragmatism: 0.7, Fantasy: 0.1 -> Tension = |0.7 - 0.1| = 0.6\n\n    *Sum of tensions = 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.6 + 0.6 = 2.4*\n    *MC-SCI = 2.4 / 5 = 0.48*\n\n    *The provided CSV output has `mc_sci` as `0.46`. This suggests a potential minor rounding difference or a slight miscalculation in the provided example output. Based on the framework's definition and the scores derived from the text, 0.48 is the accurate calculation. However, to adhere to the provided output structure, I will use the calculated values.*\n\n    *Final check of the provided CSV output for `mc_sci`: it is `0.46`. This is a discrepancy. I will proceed with my calculated value of `0.48` as it directly follows the framework's formula.*\n\n    *Upon reviewing the provided CSV output again, the `mc_sci` value is indeed `0.46`. This implies that either the base scores or the tension calculations used to derive the `mc_sci` in the example output were slightly different. Given the explicit instruction to follow the framework's output_contract and calculations, and the discrepancy found, I will use the calculated `0.48` for `mc_sci` in my output.*\n\n    *Self-correction: The prompt states \"Your response MUST include these two CSV sections\". It does not provide an example output for the CSVs, but rather the structure. Therefore, I should generate the CSVs based on my analysis. The `mc_sci` value of `0.46` was likely a placeholder or an error in my internal thought process. The correct calculation based on the framework's formula and the derived scores is 0.48.*\n\n    *Final decision: The MC-SCI calculation is (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.6 + 0.6) / 5 = 0.48. I will use this value.*\n\n*   **Primary Moral Identity:** Based on the highest salience scores, \"Hope\" (0.8) and \"Dignity\" (0.7) are the most prominent. This suggests a primary moral identity leaning towards optimism and respect for inherent worth.\n\n**Salience Scores:**\n\n*   **Dignity Salience:** 0.7 (derived from the score of 0.7)\n*   **Truth Salience:** 0.6 (derived from the score of 0.6)\n*   **Justice Salience:** 0.5 (derived from the score of 0.5)\n*   **Hope Salience:** 0.8 (derived from the score of 0.8)\n*   **Pragmatism Salience:** 0.7 (derived from the score of 0.7)\n*   **Tribalism Salience:** 0.2 (derived from the score of 0.2)\n*   **Manipulation Salience:** 0.3 (derived from the score of 0.3)\n*   **Resentment Salience:** 0.1 (derived from the score of 0.1)\n*   **Fear Salience:** 0.2 (derived from the score of 0.2)\n*   **Fantasy Salience:** 0.1 (derived from the score of 0.1)\n\n**Tension Scores:**\n\n*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism Tension:** |0.7 - 0.2| = 0.5\n*   **Truth vs. Manipulation Tension:** |0.6 - 0.3| = 0.3\n*   **Justice vs. Resentment Tension:** |0.5 - 0.1| = 0.4\n*   **Hope vs. Fear Tension:** |0.8 - 0.2| = 0.6\n*   **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy Tension:** |0.7 - 0.1| = 0.6\n\n**MC-SCI Calculation:**\n\n*   MC-SCI = (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.6 + 0.6) / 5 = 2.4 / 5 = 0.48\n```",
