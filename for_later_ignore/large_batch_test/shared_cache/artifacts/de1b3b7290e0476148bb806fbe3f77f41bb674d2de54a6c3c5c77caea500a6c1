The character exhibits a strong inclination towards optimism and a belief in fundamental human worth and fairness. The lower scores in tribalism, resentment, fear, and fantasy suggest a character that, while acknowledging challenges, strives for a more principled and forward-looking approach. The pragmatism score indicates a practical, results-oriented mindset in pursuing these ideals.",
