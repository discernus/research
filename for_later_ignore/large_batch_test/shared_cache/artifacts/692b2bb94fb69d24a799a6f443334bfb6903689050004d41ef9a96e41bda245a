The analysis below assesses the text based on the Character Assessment Framework (CAF) v5.0.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism Tension:**\n    *   Dignity Score: 0.8 (based on quotes 1, 2, 22)\n    *   Tribalism Score: 0.2 (based on quotes 11, 12)\n    *   Tension = |Dignity Score - Tribalism Score| = |0.8 - 0.2| = 0.6\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* The framework defines this tension as the absolute difference between the Dignity and Tribalism scores.\n\n*   **Truth vs. Manipulation Tension:**\n    *   Truth Score: 0.7 (based on quotes 3, 4)\n    *   Manipulation Score: 0.1 (based on quotes 13, 23)\n    *   Tension = |Truth Score - Manipulation Score| = |0.7 - 0.1| = 0.6\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* The framework defines this tension as the absolute difference between the Truth and Manipulation scores.\n\n*   **Justice vs. Resentment Tension:**\n    *   Justice Score: 0.7 (based on quotes 5, 6)\n    *   Resentment Score: 0.1 (based on quotes 15, 16)\n    *   Tension = |Justice Score - Resentment Score| = |0.7 - 0.1| = 0.6\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* The framework defines this tension as the absolute difference between the Justice and Resentment scores.\n\n*   **Hope vs. Fear Tension:**\n    *   Hope Score: 0.9 (based on quotes 7, 8)\n    *   Fear Score: 0.1 (based on quotes 17, 18)\n    *   Tension = |Hope Score - Fear Score| = |0.9 - 0.1| = 0.8\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* The framework defines this tension as the absolute difference between the Hope and Fear scores.\n\n*   **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy Tension:**\n    *   Pragmatism Score: 0.8 (based on quotes 9, 10)\n    *   Fantasy Score: 0.2 (based on quotes 19, 20)\n    *   Tension = |Pragmatism Score - Fantasy Score| = |0.8 - 0.2| = 0.6\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* The framework defines this tension as the absolute difference between the Pragmatism and Fantasy scores.\n\n*   **Moral Character-Strategic Coherence (MC-SCI):**\n    *   Dignity-Tribalism Tension: 0.6\n    *   Truth-Manipulation Tension: 0.6\n    *   Justice-Resentment Tension: 0.6\n    *   Hope-Fear Tension: 0.8\n    *   Pragmatism-Fantasy Tension: 0.6\n    *   MC-SCI = (0.6 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.8 + 0.6) / 5 = 3.2 / 5 = 0.64\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* The MC-SCI is calculated as the average of the five tension scores.\n\n**Summary of Scores:**\n\nThe address exhibits strong themes of dignity, truth, justice, hope, and pragmatism, with lower scores for tribalism, manipulation, resentment, fear, and fantasy. The overall tone is optimistic and forward-looking, emphasizing unity and opportunity. The MC-SCI score of 0.64 indicates a moderate level of coherence between the moral and strategic dimensions of the character presented. The address acknowledges past divisions (tribalism, resentment) but frames them as challenges to be overcome through unity and progress. The pragmatic elements are present in the discussion of government reform, while aspirational elements (fantasy) are also evident in the vision for education and societal advancement.",
