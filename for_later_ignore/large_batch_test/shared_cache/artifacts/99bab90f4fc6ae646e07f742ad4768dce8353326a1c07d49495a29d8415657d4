If you test a child on basic math and reading skills and you're teaching to the test, you're teaching math and reading. And that's the whole idea.

A waitress supporting two children on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earns above the $25,000. Her overtime, her hardest hours, are taxed at nearly 50 percent. This sends a terrible message: \"You'll never get ahead.\" But America's message must be different. We must honor hard work, never punish it. With tax relief, overtime will no longer be over-taxed-time for the waitresses. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage of reductions.
