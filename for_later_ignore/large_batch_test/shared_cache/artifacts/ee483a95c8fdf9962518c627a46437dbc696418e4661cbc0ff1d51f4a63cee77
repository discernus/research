Bush in 2009. The analysis focuses on assessing the character of the speaker through the lens of the provided framework, which examines ten core dimensions organized into five complementary pairs.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism Tension:**\n    *   Dignity Score: 0.7\n    *   Tribalism Score: 0.2\n    *   Tension = |Dignity Score - Tribalism Score| = |0.7 - 0.2| = 0.5\n    *   *Note: The framework defines this as a tension, so the absolute difference is used.*\n\n*   **Truth vs. Manipulation Tension:**\n    *   Truth Score: 0.6\n    *   Manipulation Score: 0.3\n    *   Tension = |Truth Score - Manipulation Score| = |0.6 - 0.3| = 0.3\n\n*   **Justice vs. Resentment Tension:**\n    *   Justice Score: 0.5\n    *   Resentment Score: 0.1\n    *   Tension = |Justice Score - Resentment Score| = |0.5 - 0.1| = 0.4\n\n*   **Hope vs. Fear Tension:**\n    *   Hope Score: 0.7\n    *   Fear Score: 0.4\n    *   Tension = |Hope Score - Fear Score| = |0.7 - 0.4| = 0.3\n\n*   **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy Tension:**\n    *   Pragmatism Score: 0.8\n    *   Fantasy Score: 0.1\n    *   Tension = |Pragmatism Score - Fantasy Score| = |0.8 - 0.1| = 0.7\n\n*   **Moral Character-Strategic Coherence (MC-SCI):**\n    *   Dignity-Tribalism Tension: 0.5\n    *   Truth-Manipulation Tension: 0.3\n    *   Justice-Resentment Tension: 0.4\n    *   Hope-Fear Tension: 0.3\n    *   Pragmatism-Fantasy Tension: 0.7\n    *   MC-SCI = (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.7) / 5 = 2.2 / 5 = 0.44\n    *   *Note: The framework specifies using the tension scores for MC-SCI calculation.*\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n\nThe analysis of President Bush's 2009 State of the Union address reveals a character profile that leans towards **dignity, truth, hope, and pragmatism**, with lower scores in **tribalism, manipulation, resentment, fear, and fantasy**.\n\n*   **Dignity** is strongly expressed through references to American ideals, the character of the people, and the responsibility of leadership.\n*   **Truth** is asserted by detailing ongoing terrorist activities and the persistent nature of threats, countering any notion that the danger has passed.\n*   **Justice** is a prominent theme, particularly in the context of national defense and bringing terrorists to justice.\n*   **Hope** is conveyed through the vision of moving forward with confidence and the positive portrayal of the military's efforts.\n*   **Pragmatism** is evident in the discussion of policy initiatives, such as the PATRIOT Act, economic measures, and educational reforms, presented as practical solutions to national challenges.\n\nConversely, **tribalism** is present but not dominant, seen in references to \"our coalition\" and \"our friend\" nations, but not to the exclusion of broader international cooperation. **Manipulation** is subtly present in framing certain policy debates, particularly concerning the No Child Left Behind Act, where the speaker attempts to discredit opposition by questioning their common sense. **Resentment** is minimal, primarily appearing in descriptions of past suffering in Iraq. **Fear** is acknowledged as a motivator for action against terrorism, but it is framed within a context of courage and resolve rather than paralyzing anxiety. **Fantasy** is addressed by directly refuting the idea that the danger is over, positioning it as a false illusion.\n\nThe **Moral Character-Strategic Coherence (MC-SCI)** score of 0.44 suggests a moderate level of coherence between the speaker's moral stances and their strategic objectives, indicating that while there are tensions, the overall presentation aims for a consistent and principled approach. The highest tension is observed between pragmatism and fantasy, likely due to the speaker's need to present practical solutions while acknowledging and countering the \"fantasy\" of a world without threats.",
