    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the document's central theme of an American 'oligarchy'. This framing drives high scores in Institutional Subversion and Systemic Replacement, as the text portrays the existing political and economic systems as fundamentally corrupt and captured by a wealthy elite, rather than merely flawed or in need of minor reform. Conversely, dimensions related to continuity, respect, and legitimacy receive low scores as they are rhetorically absent or actively undermined."
