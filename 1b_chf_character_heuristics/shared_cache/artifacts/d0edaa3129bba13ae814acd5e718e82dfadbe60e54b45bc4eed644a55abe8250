The analysis focuses on his explicit reasoning, which maps clearly to the framework's dimensions concerning constitutional procedure, institutional roles, and systemic preservation. The high scores in both 'health' and 'pathology' dimensions reflect that the speaker is using the language of constitutional health (procedure, respect) to condemn what he views as a constitutional pathology (subversion)."
