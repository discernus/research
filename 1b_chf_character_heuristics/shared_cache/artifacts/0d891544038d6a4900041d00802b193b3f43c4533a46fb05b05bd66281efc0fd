    "analysis_notes": "The document is a highly focused populist critique of perceived economic and political control by a wealthy elite ('oligarchs'). The analysis reflects the intense and central theme of institutional subversion and a strong, if less detailed, call for systemic change away from this 'oligarchic' model. The positive or 'health' dimensions of the framework are present only as rhetorical counterpoints or historical ideals, thus receiving very low scores."
