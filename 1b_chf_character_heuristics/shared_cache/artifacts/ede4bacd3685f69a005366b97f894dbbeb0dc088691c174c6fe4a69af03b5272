The speech strongly advocates for civil rights and highlights the failures of existing legislative processes to address systemic injustices, leaning towards more direct action and societal upheaval. The framework's dimensions are applied to assess the rhetorical emphasis on procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity versus their subversions."
