Bush. The analysis framework (CAF v5.0) assesses character through ten core dimensions organized into five complementary pairs. Each dimension is scored on a scale of 0.0 (absent) to 1.0 (dominant), with a salience score indicating how central the dimension is to the character's presentation. Tension scores are calculated between opposing dimensions. The overall Moral Character-Strategic Coherence (MC-SCI) index is computed as the average of the five tension scores.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism Tension:**\n    *   Dignity Score: 0.8\n    *   Tribalism Score: 0.2\n    *   Tension = |Dignity Score - Tribalism Score| = |0.8 - 0.2| = 0.6\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* `0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6`\n\n*   **Truth vs. Manipulation Tension:**\n    *   Truth Score: 0.7\n    *   Manipulation Score: 0.1\n    *   Tension = |Truth Score - Manipulation Score| = |0.7 - 0.1| = 0.6\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* `0.7 - 0.1 = 0.6`\n\n*   **Justice vs. Resentment Tension:**\n    *   Justice Score: 0.6\n    *   Resentment Score: 0.1\n    *   Tension = |Justice Score - Resentment Score| = |0.6 - 0.1| = 0.5\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* `0.6 - 0.1 = 0.5`\n\n*   **Hope vs. Fear Tension:**\n    *   Hope Score: 0.8\n    *   Fear Score: 0.2\n    *   Tension = |Hope Score - Fear Score| = |0.8 - 0.2| = 0.6\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* `0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6`\n\n*   **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy Tension:**\n    *   Pragmatism Score: 0.7\n    *   Fantasy Score: 0.1\n    *   Tension = |Pragmatism Score - Fantasy Score| = |0.7 - 0.1| = 0.6\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* `0.7 - 0.1 = 0.6`\n\n*   **Moral Character-Strategic Coherence (MC-SCI) Index:**\n    *   MC-SCI = (Dignity-Tribalism Tension + Truth-Manipulation Tension + Justice-Resentment Tension + Hope-Fear Tension + Pragmatism-Fantasy Tension) / 5\n    *   MC-SCI = (0.6 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.6) / 5 = 2.9 / 5 = 0.58\n    *   *Mathematical Work:* `(0.6 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.6) / 5 = 2.9 / 5 = 0.58`\n\n**Summary of Scores:**\n\n*   **Dignity:** 0.8 (High) - Emphasized through references to inherent rights, value, and the image of the Maker.\n*   **Truth:** 0.7 (High) - Demonstrated by acknowledging obligations and the commitment to fulfilling them.\n*   **Justice:** 0.6 (Moderate) - Highlighted by the significance of liberty and the pursuit of justice for all.\n*   **Hope:** 0.8 (High) - Central theme, focusing on the expansion of freedom and a positive outlook for the future.\n*   **Pragmatism:** 0.7 (High) - Evident in the policy to support democratic movements and the acknowledgment of necessary actions.\n*   **Tribalism:** 0.2 (Low) - Minimal focus on in-group/out-group distinctions, with a broader appeal to global freedom.\n*   **Manipulation:** 0.1 (Very Low) - The speech aims for transparency and directness rather than deceptive tactics.\n*   **Resentment:** 0.1 (Very Low) - While acknowledging historical conflicts and threats, the focus is on overcoming them, not dwelling on resentment.\n*   **Fear:** 0.2 (Low) - Acknowledges threats but frames them within a context of resolve and the pursuit of freedom, rather than succumbing to fear.\n*   **Fantasy:** 0.1 (Very Low) - Grounded in principles and policy, with a focus on achievable goals rather than unrealistic aspirations.\n\n**Primary Moral Identity:** Based on the highest salience scores (Dignity and Hope), the primary moral identity leans towards a **Humanitarian Idealist** or **Freedom Advocate**.\n\n**Salience Ranking:**\n1.  Dignity (0.8)\n2.  Hope (0.8)\n3.  Truth (0.7)\n4.  Pragmatism (0.7)\n5.  Justice (0.6)\n6.  Tribalism (0.2)\n7.  Fear (0.2)\n8.  Manipulation (0.1)\n9.  Resentment (0.1)\n10. Fantasy (0.1)\n\nThe speech strongly emphasizes universal human dignity and the aspirational goal of spreading freedom, framing these as the core drivers of American policy and identity. While acknowledging threats and the need for action, the overall tone is optimistic and forward-looking, prioritizing the pursuit of justice and liberty over fear or resentment. The pragmatic approach is evident in the stated policy goals, but these are consistently linked to the higher ideals of freedom and human rights.",
