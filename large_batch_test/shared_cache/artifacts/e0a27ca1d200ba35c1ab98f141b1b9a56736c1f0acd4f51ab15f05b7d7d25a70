The framework evaluates character through ten core dimensions organized into five complementary pairs: Dignity vs. Tribalism, Truth vs. Manipulation, Justice vs. Resentment, Hope vs. Fear, and Pragmatism vs. Fantasy. For each dimension, an intensity score (0.0-1.0) and a salience score (0.0-1.0) were assigned based on the prevalence and prominence of the expressed sentiment in the text. Tension scores were calculated for each pair, representing the absolute difference between the intensity scores of the opposing dimensions. The overall Moral Character-Stochastic Coherence Index (MC-SCI) was computed as the average of the five tension scores.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism:**\n    *   Dignity Intensity: 0.8 (Strong emphasis on unity, respect, and shared values)\n    *   Tribalism Intensity: 0.2 (Minimal expression of 'us vs. them' mentality, focus on inclusivity)\n    *   Dignity-Tribalism Tension: |0.8 - 0.2| = 0.6\n\n*   **Truth vs. Manipulation:**\n    *   Truth Intensity: 0.7 (Acknowledgement of challenges and realities, commitment to facts)\n    *   Manipulation Intensity: 0.3 (Some rhetorical framing, but not overtly deceptive)\n    *   Truth-Manipulation Tension: |0.7 - 0.3| = 0.45\n\n*   **Justice vs. Resentment:**\n    *   Justice Intensity: 0.75 (Strong call for racial justice and addressing systemic issues)\n    *   Resentment Intensity: 0.1 (Minimal expression of bitterness or ill will towards specific groups)\n    *   Justice-Resentment Tension: |0.75 - 0.1| = 0.65\n\n*   **Hope vs. Fear:**\n    *   Hope Intensity: 0.85 (Overwhelmingly optimistic outlook, focus on renewal and future)\n    *   Fear Intensity: 0.2 (Acknowledgement of challenges and threats, but framed within a context of overcoming them)\n    *   Hope-Fear Tension: |0.85 - 0.2| = 0.65\n\n*   **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy:**\n    *   Pragmatism Intensity: 0.6 (Focus on actionable steps and realistic goals, acknowledging difficulties)\n    *   Fantasy Intensity: 0.1 (Minimal reliance on unrealistic expectations or purely idealistic notions)\n    *   Pragmatism-Fantasy Tension: |0.6 - 0.1| = 0.5\n\n*   **Moral Character-Stochastic Coherence Index (MC-SCI):**\n    *   MC-SCI = (Dignity-Tribalism Tension + Truth-Manipulation Tension + Justice-Resentment Tension + Hope-Fear Tension + Pragmatism-Fantasy Tension) / 5\n    *   MC-SCI = (0.6 + 0.45 + 0.65 + 0.65 + 0.5) / 5\n    *   MC-SCI = 2.85 / 5\n    *   MC-SCI = 0.57\n\n**Salience Scores:**\n\n*   Dignity Salience: 0.8 (High prominence of themes related to dignity and respect)\n*   Truth Salience: 0.7 (Significant emphasis on acknowledging and speaking truth)\n*   Justice Salience: 0.75 (Strong focus on justice and its pursuit)\n*   Hope Salience: 0.85 (Very high prominence of hopeful and optimistic messaging)\n*   Pragmatism Salience: 0.6 (Moderate but clear focus on practical actions and goals)\n*   Tribalism Salience: 0.2 (Low salience, as the speech actively works against it)\n*   Manipulation Salience: 0.3 (Low salience, rhetoric is present but not the dominant mode)\n*   Resentment Salience: 0.1 (Very low salience, minimal expression of bitterness)\n*   Fear Salience: 0.2 (Low salience, fears are acknowledged but framed as surmountable)\n*   Fantasy Salience: 0.1 (Very low salience, grounded in reality)\n\n**Primary Moral Identity:**\n\nBased on the highest salience scores, the primary moral identity of the speaker in this address leans towards **Hope** and **Dignity**, with a strong undercurrent of **Justice**. The emphasis on unity, renewal, and overcoming challenges with optimism suggests a character driven by positive aspirations and a belief in collective good.\n\n**Summary of Scores:**\n\n| Dimension                     | Intensity | Salience |\n| :---------------------------- | :-------- | :------- |\n| Dignity                       | 0.8       | 0.8      |\n| Truth                         | 0.7       | 0.7      |\n| Justice                       | 0.75      | 0.75     |\n| Hope                          | 0.85      | 0.85     |\n| Pragmatism                    | 0.6       | 0.6      |\n| Tribalism                     | 0.2       | 0.2      |\n| Manipulation                  | 0.3       | 0.3      |\n| Resentment                    | 0.1       | 0.1      |\n| Fear                          | 0.2       | 0.2      |\n| Fantasy                       | 0.1       | 0.1      |\n\n**Tension Scores:**\n\n| Tension Pair                      | Score |\n| :-------------------------------- | :---- |\n| Dignity-Tribalism Tension         | 0.6   |\n| Truth-Manipulation Tension        | 0.45  |\n| Justice-Resentment Tension        | 0.65  |\n| Hope-Fear Tension                 | 0.65  |\n| Pragmatism-Fantasy Tension        | 0.5   |\n\n**MC-SCI:** 0.57",
