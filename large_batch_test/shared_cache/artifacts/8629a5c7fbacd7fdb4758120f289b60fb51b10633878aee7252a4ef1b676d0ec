If you haven't been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has: a friend, a neighbor, a member of your family.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,dignity,2,\"But while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken, United States of America will emerge stronger than before.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,truth,3,\"The fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight, nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank. We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy, yet we import more oil today than ever before.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,truth,4,\"Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for. And though all these challenges went unsolved, we still manage to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our Government, than ever before.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,justice,5,\"In other words, we have lived through an era where too often short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity, where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election. A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,justice,6,\"Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time, on some other day. Well, that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of our future is here.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,hope,7,\"Now is the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity. Now is the time to jump-start job creation, restart lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,hope,8,\"So the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track. But it is just the first step. Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,pragmatism,9,\"My budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue. It reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited, a trillion-dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession. Given these realities, everyone in this chamber, Democrats and Republicans, will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars. And that includes me. But that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term challenges.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,pragmatism,10,\"For history tells a different story. History reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation, this Nation has responded with bold action and big ideas. In the midst of Civil War, we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry. From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age. In the wake of war and depression, the G.I. bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle class in history. And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nationwide highway system, an American on the Moon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,tribalism,11,\"I know there are some in this Chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work, and I understand that skepticism. Here in Washington, we've all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending. And with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,tribalism,12,\"I know that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and the results that followed. So were the American taxpayers; so was I. So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,manipulation,13,\"We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy, yet we import more oil today than ever before.

And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, I ask Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch, as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country, Senator Edward Kennedy.\",speech\na1dafe346a64,fear,17,\"The fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight, nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank.
