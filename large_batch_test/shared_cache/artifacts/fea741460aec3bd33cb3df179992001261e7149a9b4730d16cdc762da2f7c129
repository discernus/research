The speaker projects a worldview where American democracy, though tested, can deliver tangible benefits and overcome crises through unified, practical action. The dominant dimensions are Hope and Pragmatism, evidenced by a focus on specific, large-scale investment plans (American Jobs Plan, American Families Plan) and a consistently forward-looking, positive framing. The core tension is between this hopeful, unifying vision and the acknowledged threats of domestic division, autocratic competition, and systemic injustice. The Moral Character-Strategic Coherence Index (MC-SCI) is moderate-to-high, indicating a consistent character presentation that strongly favors virtuous dimensions over their counterparts.\",\n  \"document_analyses\": {\n    \"Biden_SOTU_2022.txt\": {\n      \"worldview\": \"The speaker operates from a worldview of pragmatic optimism, believing that American democracy's strength lies in its ability to deliver tangible, equitable results for its people. He sees the nation at an inflection point, capable of overcoming significant crises (pandemic, economic downturn, political division) through collective action, government investment, and a return to core values of fairness and unity. This worldview positions America in a global competition against autocracy, where success is defined by proving that democratic governance is more effective and just.\",\n      \"scores\": {\n        \"Dignity\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.7\n        },\n        \"Tribalism\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.3,\n          \"salience\": 0.4\n        },\n        \"Truth\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.6\n        },\n        \"Manipulation\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.2\n        },\n        \"Justice\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"Resentment\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.2,\n          \"salience\": 0.3\n        },\n        \"Hope\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"Fear\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.4,\n          \"salience\": 0.5\n        },\n        \"Pragmatism\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"Fantasy\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": {\n        \"Dignity\": [\n          \"Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?\",\n          \"To all the transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want you to know your President has your back.\"\n        ],\n        \"Tribalism\": [\n          \"We can\u2019t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.\",\n          \"I can report to the Nation: America is on the move again...

Fear is acknowledged as a motivator for action but is consistently contrasted with and subordinated to Hope. Tribalism is actively countered with calls for bipartisan unity, though a form of national-level tribalism exists in the framing of competition with China. Resentment, Manipulation, and Fantasy are minimally present, as the tone is about fairness rather than punishment, the proposals are direct, and the plans are grounded in data and specific actions.\",\n      \"salience_ranking\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Hope\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.9,\n          \"rank\": 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Pragmatism\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.9,\n          \"rank\": 2\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Justice\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.8,\n          \"rank\": 3\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Dignity\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.7,\n          \"rank\": 4\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Truth\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.6,\n          \"rank\": 5\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Fear\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.5,\n          \"rank\": 6\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Tribalism\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.4,\n          \"rank\": 7\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Resentment\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.3,\n          \"rank\": 8\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Manipulation\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.2,\n          \"rank\": 9\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Fantasy\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.1,\n          \"rank\": 10\n        }\n      ],\n      \"character_priorities\": \"The speaker's primary moral identity is that of a pragmatic unifier and hopeful builder.
