The results, including a narrative summary, detailed calculations, and the required CSV data sections, are presented below.\n\n**Artifact ID:** 0cf4f4573185...\n\n### **Character Assessment Narrative**\n\nThe 1998 State of the Union address by President Bill Clinton presents a character profile dominated by the virtues of Hope, Pragmatism, and Justice. The speech is structured as a comprehensive, data-driven plan to address the nation's economic challenges, particularly the federal deficit, while investing in future opportunities.\n\nThe primary moral identity projected is that of a pragmatic and hopeful leader calling for unity and shared sacrifice. The dimension of **Pragmatism** is exceptionally high in both intensity and salience, evidenced by the detailed, four-part economic plan, the emphasis on using conservative CBO budget estimates, and the focus on funding programs that \"really work.\" This is paired with a powerful message of **Hope**, which frames the proposed sacrifices not as a burden, but as an investment in a \"much greater one tomorrow\" and a way to secure the \"American dream for ourselves and for future generations.\"\n\nThe principle of **Justice** serves as a core moral justification for the plan's structure. Clinton repeatedly argues for fairness, ensuring that the \"burdens are borne\" by those who can most afford them and that the system rewards the dignity of work for all Americans. This is contrasted with a near-total absence of **Resentment**; the speech explicitly avoids assigning blame for past problems, instead calling for shared responsibility.\n\nSimilarly, the address is a strong appeal for **Dignity** and against **Tribalism**. Clinton advocates for policies that lift up \"working poor Americans\" and calls for an end to \"partisan bickering,\" framing the challenges as ones \"we are all in this together\" to solve. The commitment to **Truth** over **Manipulation** is another salient theme, highlighted by the repeated insistence on using \"honest\" and \"credible\" numbers to build trust and avoid the \"rhetoric of the past.\"\n\nThe overall character presentation is highly coherent, with the virtuous dimensions strongly expressed and their opposing vices almost entirely absent. This results in high tension scores across most pairs and a strong Moral Character-Strategic Coherence Index (MC-SCI), indicating a consistent and well-integrated message.\n\n### **Calculations**\n\n**1. Tension Scores**\nThe tension score for each dimension pair is calculated as the absolute difference between the virtue's intensity score and the vice's intensity score: `Tension = |Virtue_Score - Vice_Score|`.\n\n*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism Tension:**\n    *   Dignity Intensity: 0.8\n    *   Tribalism Intensity: 0.1\n    *   Calculation: `|0.8 - 0.1| = 0.7`\n\n*   **Truth vs. Manipulation Tension:**\n    *   Truth Intensity: 0.8\n    *   Manipulation Intensity: 0.1\n    *   Calculation: `|0.8 - 0.1| = 0.7`\n\n*   **Justice vs. Resentment Tension:**\n    *   Justice Intensity: 0.9\n    *   Resentment Intensity: 0.1\n    *   Calculation: `|0.9 - 0.1| = 0.8`\n\n*   **Hope vs. Fear Tension:**\n    *   Hope Intensity: 0.9\n    *   Fear Intensity: 0.4\n    *   Calculation: `|0.9 - 0.4| = 0.5`\n\n*   **Pragmatism vs. Fantasy Tension:**\n    *   Pragmatism Intensity: 0.9\n    *   Fantasy Intensity: 0.1\n    *   Calculation: `|0.9 - 0.1| = 0.8`\n\n**2. Moral Character-Strategic Coherence Index (MC-SCI)**\nThe MC-SCI is the average of the five tension scores.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   `(0.7 + 0.7 + 0.8 + 0.5 + 0.8) / 5`\n    *   `3.5 / 5 = 0.70`\n\nThe MC-SCI of 0.70 falls into the \"Good\" range, indicating a high degree of coherence between the articulated moral framework (the virtues) and the strategic approach, with minimal expression of opposing vices.\n\n```\n<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\naid,dignity,truth,justice,hope,pragmatism,tribalism,manipulation,resentment,fear,fantasy,dignity_salience,truth_salience,justice_salience,hope_salience,pragmatism_salience,tribalism_salience,manipulation_salience,resentment_salience,fear_salience,fantasy_salience,dignity_tribalism_tension,truth_manipulation_tension,justice_resentment_tension,hope_fear_tension,pragmatism_fantasy_tension,mc_sci\n0cf4f4573185...,0.8,0.8,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.4,0.1,0.8,0.8,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.7,0.2,0.2,0.5,0.2,0.7,0.7,0.8,0.5,0.8,0.7\n<<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>\n\n<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>\naid,dimension,quote_id,quote_text,context_type\n0cf4f4573185...,Dignity,1,\"If we believe in restoring the values that make America special, we must believe that there is dignity in all work, and there must be dignity for all workers.\",direct_quote\n0cf4f4573185...,Dignity,2,\"By expanding the refundable earned-income tax credit, we will make history.
