# Character Assessment Framework v5.0

**Version**: v5.0  
**Status**: Active  
**Major Change**: Embedded CSV Architecture for Synthesis Scalability

---

## Overview

CAF assesses character through systematic evaluation of ten core dimensions organized in five complementary pairs. Each pair represents fundamental tension in human character and decision-making.

**Purpose**: Objective character measurement through evidence-based analysis of moral priorities and behavioral patterns.

**Applications**: Leadership assessment, discourse analysis, character development evaluation.

---

## Character Dimensions

#### Dignity vs Tribalism
- **Dignity (0.0-1.0)**: Respect for inherent worth of all people, regardless of differences
- **Tribalism (0.0-1.0)**: Favoring one's own group at expense of outsiders

#### Truth vs Manipulation  
- **Truth (0.0-1.0)**: Commitment to honesty, accuracy, transparency in communication
- **Manipulation (0.0-1.0)**: Deliberately distorting information to achieve desired outcomes

#### Justice vs Resentment
- **Justice (0.0-1.0)**: Fairness, impartiality, proportionality in treatment and judgment  
- **Resentment (0.0-1.0)**: Bitterness toward those perceived as more fortunate or successful

#### Hope vs Fear
- **Hope (0.0-1.0)**: Optimism about future and confidence in positive possibilities
- **Fear (0.0-1.0)**: Anxiety about future and focus on potential threats or losses

#### Pragmatism vs Fantasy
- **Pragmatism (0.0-1.0)**: Practical, realistic approach to solving problems and achieving goals
- **Fantasy (0.0-1.0)**: Unrealistic expectations disconnected from practical realities

## Scoring Protocol

**Intensity Scale**: 0.0 (absent) to 1.0 (dominant expression)  
**Salience Scale**: 0.0 (peripheral) to 1.0 (central to character presentation)

**Requirements**:
- Score all ten dimensions for intensity and salience
- Provide 1-2 strongest quotes per dimension  
- Calculate tension scores for each pair
- Compute Moral Character-Strategic Coherence Index (MC-SCI)

---

## Character Calculations

**Tension Scores**: |Virtue Score - Vice Score| for each pair
**MC-SCI**: Overall character coherence measure across all dimensions
**Character Profile**: Primary moral identity based on highest-salience dimensions
