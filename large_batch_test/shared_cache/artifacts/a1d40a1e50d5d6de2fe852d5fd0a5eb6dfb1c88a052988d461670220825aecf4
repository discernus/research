There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection. More than 4 million require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims are receiving the medicine they need.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,resentment,31,\"Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, 'We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell people, 'You've got AIDS. We can't help you. Go home and die.' In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,resentment,32,\"AIDS can be prevented. Antiretroviral drugs can extend life for many years. And the cost of those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to under $300 a year, which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp. Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,fear,33,\"We have confronted and will continue to confront HIV/AIDS in our own country. And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa. This comprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new AIDS infections, treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS and for children orphaned by AIDS. I ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next 5 years, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,fear,34,\"This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature. And this Nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating manmade evil of international terrorism.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,fantasy,35,\"There are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on terror. There's never a day when I do not learn of another threat or receive reports of operations in progress or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers. The war goes on, and we are winning.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,fantasy,36,\"To date, we've arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of Al Qaida. They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September 11th attacks, the chief of Al Qaida operations in the Pakistan Gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in east Africa and the U.S. Cole, and an Al Qaida operative chief from Southeast Asia, a former director of Al Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan, a key Al Qaida operative in Europe, a major Al Qaida leader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way: They are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,dignity_tribalism_tension,37,\"Our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq.

To the contrary, he is deceiving. From intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,truth_manipulation_tension,39,\"The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He's clearly has much to hide.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,truth_manipulation_tension,40,\"Our intelligence in Iraq indicates that Saddam Hussein's regime is rebuilding its chemical and biological weapons programs, that he is actively trying to acquire nuclear weapons, and that he has not accounted for or destroyed his existing weapons of mass destruction.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,justice_resentment_tension,41,\"The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not settle for any countdown to terror that is merely a countdown to be followed by the destruction of our people.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,justice_resentment_tension,42,\"The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. We will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If the Iraqi regime does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm it.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,hope_fear_tension,43,\"We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means, sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military, and we will prevail.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,hope_fear_tension,44,\"And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,pragmatism_fantasy_tension,45,\"Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season. In 2 years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril, from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes. And we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the right country.\",speech\n46510c1431e6,pragmatism_fantasy_tension,46,\"Americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world and to ourselves. America is a strong nation and honorable in the use of our strength. We exercise power without conquest, and we sacrifice for the liberty of strangers.\",speech\n<<<END_DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>\n```",
