    "The experiment's stated research question, \"Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion than populist styles?\", requires a statistical comparison between documents grouped by the `style` metadata field. The corpus contains only one document (mccain_2008_concession) with `style: \"institutional\"`, while the 'populist' group contains three. A group size of n=1 is insufficient for the required inferential testing.",
    "The experiment definition contains conflicting research questions. The initial specification block asks \"Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion than populist styles?\", while the scholarly narrative within the main experiment file asks \"What are the baseline cohesion and tension scores for the documents in the sample corpus?\".",
    "The framework's scholarly document section refers to it as \"Cohesive Flourishing Framework (v10.0)\", but its machine-readable appendix specifies `framework_version: \"10.2\"."
