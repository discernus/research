    "The experiment specification lists two research questions in the introductory section, but lists three research questions in the formal '## Research Questions' section. This creates an inconsistency in the human-readable research plan.",
    "The experiment's third research question seeks to compare 'populist conservative and progressive styles.' However, the corpus contains only one document (N=1) for the 'populist_conservative' style ('king_2017_house_floor'). According to Discernus v10.0 statistical execution standards, groups with N<2 must be treated as baselines and are excluded from inferential statistical tests like ANOVA or t-tests.",
    "In the framework's machine-readable appendix, the 'description' for the 'populist_strategic_contradiction_index' derived metric states it is 'calculated as the average of the three core tension scores'. This language imprecisely implies a dependency on other derived metrics. The formula itself correctly and robustly calculates the value directly from base dimensions, but the description does not reflect this superior implementation detail."
