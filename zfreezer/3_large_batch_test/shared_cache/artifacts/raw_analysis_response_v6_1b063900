The emphasis on authenticity versus the political class, coupled with the construction of a homogeneous people, suggests a strategy to consolidate a distinct 'us' against a corrupt 'them'.\n\nKey strategic tensions identified include the democratic-authoritarian tension (high popular sovereignty claims vs. potential anti-pluralist exclusion) and the internal-external focus tension (homogeneous people construction vs. nationalist exclusion).\n\nThe overall discourse profile is 'High-Intensity Populism', indicating a significant reliance on core populist appeals to mobilize support and delegitimize opposition."
