The framework's sequential analysis approach was applied, focusing on core anchors, then mechanisms, and finally boundary distinctions. High confidence in the dimensional scoring due to clear textual indicators aligning with the framework's definitions. Salience and confidence were assessed based on the centrality of the populist theme within the document's rhetoric."
