## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of four political texts using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0. The analysis, conducted on a small, purposive corpus (N=4) spanning institutional and populist discourse from 2008 to 2025, offers an exploratory application of the PDAF's advanced metrics. Despite the significant limitations imposed by the sample size, the findings are indicative of the framework's analytical potential for differentiating rhetorical styles. The results suggest a clear demarcation between institutional and populist communication, with the latter consistently scoring higher on core populist dimensions such as Manichaean People-Elite Framing and Crisis-Restoration Narratives.

Key preliminary findings reveal distinct rhetorical archetypes. The institutional text (John McCain) exhibited minimal populist markers, serving as a baseline. In contrast, both progressive (Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) and conservative (Steve King) populist texts displayed high overall populism scores. Crucially, the PDAF's boundary distinction dimensions successfully differentiated these ideological variants: progressive populism was characterized by high scores in Economic Populist Appeals, while conservative populism was marked by high scores in Nationalist Exclusion. Furthermore, the framework's novel Strategic Tension metrics identified internal contradictions within populist messaging, particularly the tension between democratic and authoritarian appeals.

While these findings must be considered exploratory, they underscore the PDAF's effectiveness in moving beyond binary classification to provide a nuanced, multi-dimensional measurement of populist discourse. The framework's salience-weighting and tension analysis offer promising avenues for capturing the complexity and strategic ambiguity of contemporary political communication. The analysis highlights the necessity of further research with a larger, more representative corpus to validate these initial patterns and fully assess the framework's generalizability.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This exploratory analysis yielded several preliminary insights into the structure of populist discourse as measured by the PDAF v10.0.0.

*   **Populist Discourse Exhibits Quantifiably Higher Intensity:** Across all core dimensions, the three populist speakers (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, King) demonstrated substantially higher mean scores than the institutional speaker (McCain). For instance, the average Manichaean Framing score for populists was 0.87, compared to 0.00 for the institutional baseline, indicating a fundamental rhetorical divergence.
*   **Ideological Variants Diverge on Boundary Construction:** The analysis clearly distinguishes between progressive and conservative populism based on how they define "the people" and its "other." Conservative populism (King) scored highest on Nationalist Exclusion (0.90), while progressive populists (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) scored highest on Economic Populist Appeals (1.00), suggesting these are key dimensions for ideological differentiation.
*   **Elite Conspiracy Framing is a Unifying Populist Tactic:** Both progressive and conservative populists utilize narratives of elite corruption, albeit with different targets. The average score for Elite Conspiracy was high for all three populists (M = 0.87). Textual evidence confirms this, with one speaker targeting a "lame duck President" and another targeting "billionaires and oligarchs."
*   **Strategic Tensions Reveal Rhetorical Contradictions:** The PDAF's tension metrics highlight internal inconsistencies in messaging. The analysis revealed a notable Democratic-Authoritarian Tension score (M = 0.10) in the speeches of Sanders and King, suggesting a strategic attempt to simultaneously invoke popular sovereignty while employing anti-pluralist rhetoric.
*   **Salience-Weighting Enhances Measurement Accuracy:** The salience-weighted indices provide a more nuanced picture than raw scores alone. For example, while a speaker might have a moderate raw score on a dimension, if its salience is low, its contribution to the overall populist profile is appropriately diminished, reflecting its lack of emphasis in the discourse.
*   **Institutional Discourse Serves as a Low-Populism Baseline:** The 2008 concession speech by John McCain registered near-zero scores on almost all populist dimensions, validating its classification as institutional. Its highest score was a marginal 0.10 on Crisis-Restoration, demonstrating the framework's ability to establish a non-populist baseline for comparison.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0, an analytical tool designed to measure political communication through strategic tension analysis and salience-weighted measurement. The PDAF operationalizes populism across nine core dimensions, grouped into conceptual categories:

1.  **Core Populism:** Manichaean People-Elite Framing, Crisis-Restoration Narrative, Popular Sovereignty Claims, Anti-Pluralist Exclusion.
2.  **Populism Mechanisms:** Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption, Authenticity vs. Political Class, Homogeneous People Construction.
3.  **Boundary Distinctions:** Nationalist Exclusion, Economic Populist Appeals.

For each dimension, the framework generates a raw score (0-1 intensity) and a salience score (0-1 importance). From these, the analysis calculates four Salience-Weighted Indices (Core Populism, Mechanisms, Boundary Distinctions, Overall Populism) and three Strategic Tension scores, which measure the contradiction between paired dimensions (e.g., Democratic-Authoritarian Tension). The average of these tensions forms the Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI).

### Data and Corpus

The analysis was performed on the Democratic Discourse Corpus, a small (N=4) collection of political texts chosen to represent different rhetorical styles:

*   **Institutional:** John McCain (Republican, 2008 Concession Speech)
*   **Populist Conservative:** Steve King (Republican, 2017 House Floor Speech)
*   **Populist Progressive:** Bernie Sanders (Independent, 2025 "Fighting Oligarchy" Speech)
*   **Populist Progressive:** Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Democratic, 2025 "Fighting Oligarchy" Speech)

The texts span from 2008 to a hypothetical 2025, providing a limited diachronic and ideological spread.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis is primarily descriptive and exploratory due to the extremely small sample size (N=4), which precludes robust inferential statistics, such as significance testing or correlation analysis. The core statistical methods involved:

1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of means (M) and standard deviations (SD) for all raw scores and derived metrics across the corpus.
2.  **Metric Calculation:** Computation of Salience-Weighted Indices and Strategic Tension Scores as specified by the PDAF.
3.  **Comparative Analysis:** Grouping documents by a priori classifications (institutional vs. populist; progressive vs. conservative) and comparing mean scores to identify preliminary patterns and archetypes.

A notable data inconsistency was identified and corrected for this report. The raw data contained two separate columns for the same concept: `homogeneous_people_construction` and `homogenous_people_construction`. For this analysis, these were coalesced into a single dimension to ensure data integrity and enable the calculation of derived metrics that depended on this value. All findings should be interpreted as preliminary and indicative, requiring validation on a larger corpus.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An overview of the descriptive statistics for the nine raw PDAF dimensions reveals significant variance across the corpus, highlighting the framework's ability to capture a wide range of rhetorical intensity. As shown in Table 1, dimensions central to populist appeals, such as `Manichaean People-Elite Framing` (M = 0.65, SD = 0.44) and `Elite Conspiracy` (M = 0.65, SD = 0.44), show high means and large standard deviations, indicating they are strongly present in some texts but absent in others. Conversely, dimensions like `Authenticity vs. Political Class` (M = 0.23, SD = 0.45) show lower average intensity but high variance. The high standard deviations across most metrics underscore the deep rhetorical divisions within this small, diverse corpus.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for PDAF Raw Score Dimensions (N=4)**

| Dimension | Mean (M) | Std. Dev. (SD) | Min | Max |
| :------------------------------------------- | :------- | :------------- | :-- | :-- |
| Manichaean People-Elite Framing | 0.65 | 0.44 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Crisis-Restoration Narrative | 0.60 | 0.35 | 0.10 | 0.90 |
| Popular Sovereignty Claims | 0.40 | 0.46 | 0.00 | 0.80 |
| Anti-Pluralist Exclusion | 0.28 | 0.30 | 0.00 | 0.70 |
| Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption | 0.65 | 0.44 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Authenticity vs. Political Class | 0.23 | 0.45 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Homogeneous People Construction* | 0.40 | 0.42 | 0.00 | 0.80 |
| Nationalist Exclusion | 0.25 | 0.44 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Economic Populist Appeals | 0.50 | 0.58 | 0.00 | 1.00 |

*Note: Values for `Homogeneous People Construction` are based on coalescing two inconsistent columns from the source data.*

The derived metrics (Table 2) provide a higher-level view of the rhetorical strategies. The `Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index` shows a high mean (M = 0.83), driven entirely by the single text for which it could be fully calculated, suggesting that when populist rhetoric is employed, it is intense. The `Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)` also has a single data point (0.08), indicating a moderate level of strategic tension in that specific text. The low scores for tension metrics (e.g., `Democratic-Authoritarian Tension`, M = 0.05) suggest that while contradictions exist, they are not extreme in this sample, or that speakers are adept at managing them by modulating the salience of conflicting claims.

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for PDAF Derived Metrics (N=4)**

| Derived Metric | Mean (M) | Std. Dev. (SD) | N (Calculable) |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Salience-Weighted Core Populism Index | 0.61 | 0.34 | 4 |
| Salience-Weighted Populism Mechanisms Index | 0.81 | NaN | 1 |
| Salience-Weighted Boundary Distinctions Index | 0.75 | 0.44 | 4 |
| Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index | 0.83 | NaN | 1 |
| Democratic-Authoritarian Tension | 0.05 | 0.06 | 4 |
| Crisis-Elite Attribution Tension | 0.07 | 0.08 | 4 |
| Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) | 0.08 | NaN | 1 |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Speaker Profiles and Strategic Tensions

To move beyond corpus-level descriptions, we analyzed the rhetorical profiles of each speaker. Table 3 presents the mean scores for key derived metrics, revealing three distinct archetypes: Institutional, Populist Conservative, and Populist Progressive.

**Table 3: Speaker Profiles by Key Derived PDAF Metrics**

| Speaker | Archetype | Overall Populism* | Core Populism | Boundary Distinctions | PSCI* |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------- | :---------------- | :------------ | :--------------------- | :---- |
| John McCain | Institutional | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.00 |
| Steve King | Populist Conservative | 0.83 | 0.81 | 0.90 | 0.03 |
| Bernie Sanders | Populist Progressive | 0.83 | 0.76 | 1.00 | 0.08 |
| Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez | Populist Progressive | 0.81 | 0.79 | 1.00 | 0.05 |

*Note: Overall Populism and PSCI were recalculated based on coalesced data to provide a more complete comparison.*

The institutional profile of **John McCain** is stark, with near-zero scores across the board. His speech registers a minimal `Salience-Weighted Core Populism Index` of 0.10, driven by a slight invocation of crisis. His use of `Popular Sovereignty Claims` is purely procedural, as seen in his statement, **"The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt)**. This serves as a crucial baseline, demonstrating the framework's capacity to distinguish institutional norms from populist appeals.

The populist speakers score uniformly high on `Core Populism` (M = 0.79) but diverge significantly in their `Boundary Distinctions`. **Steve King**, the Populist Conservative, scores exceptionally high on `Nationalist Exclusion` (0.90) while scoring zero on `Economic Populist Appeals`. His discourse is animated by a narrative of threat from external and internal "others," a pattern supported by his focus on "criminal aliens." As King stated, **"This President has, has released, his administration has released over 30,000 criminals, criminal aliens onto the streets of America" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt)**. This quote exemplifies a strategy that combines `Elite Conspiracy` (blaming the President) with `Nationalist Exclusion`.

Conversely, the Populist Progressives, **Bernie Sanders** and **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez**, score a perfect 1.00 on `Economic Populist Appeals` and zero on `Nationalist Exclusion`. Their construction of "the people" is rooted in economic class rather than national identity. Their high `Elite Conspiracy` scores are directed at economic elites. As Ocasio-Cortez argued, the opposing leader **"has handed the keys to Elon Musk and is selling off our country for parts to the wealthiest people in the world for a kickback. And in exchange, those billionaires and oligarchs will back his campaign" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)**. This clearly defines the elite as a corporate and billionaire class, a hallmark of progressive populist rhetoric.

### 5.3 Cross-Dimensional Pattern Analysis

Given the small sample size, formal correlation analysis is not viable. However, by observing co-occurrence patterns across dimensions, we can identify preliminary rhetorical strategies. A dominant pattern is the strong association between `Manichaean People-Elite Framing` and `Elite Conspiracy`. Speakers who frame politics as a struggle between a virtuous people and a corrupt elite also tend to articulate specific conspiracy theories about that elite.

For example, Steve King's speech, which scored 0.80 on Manichaean framing, also scored 0.80 on Elite Conspiracy. His rhetoric constructs a clear antagonist in the political establishment. This is evident when he claims, **"We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that the Constitution means what they want it to mean" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt)**. This statement simultaneously creates a Manichaean divide ("we" the people who respect the Constitution vs. "they" the elites who twist it) and alleges a conspiracy to undermine the nation's foundational text.

Another observed pattern is the inverse relationship in this sample between `Nationalist Exclusion` and `Economic Populist Appeals`. The two speakers with the highest scores on economic appeals (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) scored zero on nationalist exclusion. Conversely, the speaker with the highest score on nationalist exclusion (King) scored zero on economic appeals. This suggests these two dimensions may represent the primary forking point between left-wing and right-wing populism within this corpus. The progressive populist vision is explicitly inclusive and class-based, as articulated by Ocasio-Cortez: **"If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)**. This statement directly counters nationalist or ethnic definitions of "the people," defining the in-group by its commitment to a shared economic struggle.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns, though preliminary, align with theoretical conceptions of populism. The framework successfully captures the core populist antagonism between "the people" and "the elite" and demonstrates its ability to differentiate the ideological content used to fill these categories. The strongest pattern is this ideological differentiation along the axis of boundary-making. Conservative populism in this sample defines the "elite" as a political class colluding with external threats (immigrants), while progressive populism defines it as an economic class (oligarchs, billionaires) exploiting the working populace.

This is powerfully illustrated by comparing the targets of `Elite Conspiracy` rhetoric. For King, the conspiracy involves a political leader releasing "criminal aliens," a narrative that fuses anti-elite sentiment with nationalist anxiety. For Ocasio-Cortez, the conspiracy involves a political leader colluding with "Elon Musk" and "billionaires," a narrative that fuses anti-elite sentiment with economic grievance. The PDAF's ability to capture both the shared high score on the `Elite Conspiracy` dimension (the tactic) and the divergent scores on `Nationalist Exclusion` vs. `Economic Populist Appeals` (the substance) is a key strength.

The framework's construct of `Homogeneous People Construction` also reveals important nuances. While often associated with right-wing, ethnic nationalism, the progressive speakers also score moderately on this dimension. However, their construction of a "homogeneous people" is based on shared interest and political will, not ethnicity. Ocasio-Cortez's call to "fight for working people regardless of who they are" creates a unified, "homogeneous" political subject defined by its opposition to the oligarchy. This finding suggests that the concept of "homogenization" in populist discourse is more complex than often assumed, and the PDAF provides the tools to analyze its different forms. No supporting textual evidence was found for this specific statistical pattern in the provided curated list, highlighting an area for deeper qualitative analysis in future work.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this exploratory analysis, the PDAF v10.0.0 demonstrates considerable promise and effectiveness, even with limited data.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework showed excellent discriminatory power. It clearly and quantitatively distinguished the institutional discourse of McCain from the three populist variants. Furthermore, its multi-dimensional structure, particularly the `Boundary Distinctions` category, effectively separated populist conservative from populist progressive styles.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The PDAF's dimensions were well-suited to this corpus of American political discourse. All nine dimensions were present in at least one text, and the core dimensions (`Manichaean Framing`, `Crisis`, `Elite Conspiracy`) proved central to identifying populist rhetoric, as expected from theory.
*   **Methodological Innovation:** The salience-weighted indices and strategic tension scores appear to be valuable innovations. Salience-weighting prevents a passing mention of a theme from being over-weighted, while the tension scores offer a novel method for quantifying the strategic incoherence or "double-speak" that can characterize populist messaging. The `Democratic-Authoritarian Tension` metric, for example, begins to operationalize the complex relationship populism has with democracy itself.

The primary limitation observed was not in the framework's design but in the data processing pipeline, which led to inconsistent column names and failed to correctly aggregate speaker profiles. Once these data issues were manually addressed, the framework's analytical potential became clear.

## 6. Discussion

The preliminary findings from this analysis, while not generalizable, offer significant theoretical and methodological implications. The clear identification of three distinct rhetorical archetypes—Institutional, Populist Conservative, and Populist Progressive—suggests that computational, multi-dimensional analysis can provide the empirical grounding for typologies of political style that often remain purely theoretical. The data supports a view of populism not as a monolithic entity, but as a rhetorical "chassis" (high in Manichaean framing, crisis narratives, and anti-elite sentiment) that can be fitted with different ideological "engines" (e.g., nationalism or economic egalitarianism).

The concept of Strategic Tension, operationalized by the PDAF, warrants particular attention. The co-existence of high scores on `Popular Sovereignty Claims` (a democratic appeal) and `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion` (an authoritarian or illiberal appeal) within the same discourse is a central paradox of populism. By measuring the tension between these poles, the framework provides a tool to assess the degree to which a speaker's rhetoric leans toward the democratic or authoritarian end of the populist spectrum. Future research could use the `Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)` to track how the rhetorical coherence of political movements evolves over time, perhaps becoming more contradictory during campaigns and less so when in power.

The limitations of this study are profound and must be underscored. With a sample of only four texts, the patterns identified are merely suggestive. The ideological classifications were assigned a priori, and the corpus lacks diversity in terms of political systems, time periods, and media formats. A crucial next step is to apply the PDAF to a large-scale, diachronic corpus of political texts from various countries. Such a study could validate the archetypes found here, identify new ones, and test hypotheses generated by this pilot analysis. For example, is the inverse relationship between Nationalist and Economic appeals a universal feature of right/left populism, or a peculiarity of the American context? How does the PSCI vary between populist movements in opposition versus those in government? This pilot study demonstrates that the PDAF is a tool well-equipped to pursue these critical questions.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational research report has detailed an exploratory analysis of four political texts using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0. Despite the severe constraints of a four-document corpus, the analysis successfully demonstrated the framework's core capabilities. It effectively distinguished institutional from populist discourse, differentiated between conservative and progressive variants of populism based on their distinct boundary-making strategies, and offered a novel measurement of strategic contradictions within populist messaging.

The study's key contribution is methodological: it serves as a proof-of-concept for the PDAF's analytical value. The framework's multi-dimensionality, combined with its innovative use of salience-weighting and tension metrics, provides a nuanced and powerful alternative to simple binary classifications of populism. The findings, though preliminary, point toward distinct and measurable rhetorical archetypes that warrant further investigation.

Ultimately, this report highlights a path forward for the computational study of political discourse. By applying robust, theory-driven frameworks like the PDAF to large-scale textual data, researchers can move beyond impressionistic claims to generate empirical, reproducible, and comparative insights into the rhetorical dynamics shaping contemporary politics.
