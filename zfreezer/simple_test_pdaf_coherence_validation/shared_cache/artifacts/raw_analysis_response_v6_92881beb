    "analysis_notes": "The document is a presidential concession speech. Its primary rhetorical purpose is to acknowledge defeat, affirm the legitimacy of the democratic process, and call for national unity. Consequently, it is structurally antithetical to most populist themes, which are typically divisive and anti-establishment. The scores across nearly all dimensions are zero or near-zero, as the text actively promotes pluralism, respect for opponents, and institutional norms."
