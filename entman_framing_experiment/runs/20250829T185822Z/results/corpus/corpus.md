## Corpus Design Rationale

This corpus is designed to provide maximum analytical leverage for the Entman Framing Functions Framework:

1. **Function Variation**: Documents represent different combinations and emphasis patterns of the four framing functions
2. **Strategic Diversity**: Different organizational contexts (political, corporate, NGO) to test framework robustness
3. **Function Independence**: Several documents emphasize specific functions while minimizing others to test independence hypothesis
4. **Message Completeness**: Range from single-function focus to comprehensive four-function deployment
5. **Strategic Complexity**: Documents with varying levels of strategic framing sophistication

## Expected Framework Exercise

The corpus will test the framework's ability to:
- Distinguish between independent framing functions
- Measure the independence of function deployment
- Assess strategic communication patterns
- Validate Entman's systematic framing analysis approach

This corpus design ensures comprehensive testing of the framework's analytical capabilities while maintaining the coherence necessary for meaningful research outcomes.
