## Research Question

How do strategic communicators deploy the four independent framing functions (Problem Definition, Causal Attribution, Moral Evaluation, Treatment Recommendation) and to what extent do these functions operate independently as predicted by Entman's theory?

## Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis (H1): Framing Function Independence
The four framing functions will operate as independent analytical dimensions, with communications showing varying emphasis across functions without necessary correlation.

**Falsifiable Prediction**: Statistical analysis will reveal low correlations between framing functions, supporting Entman's independence hypothesis.

### Secondary Hypothesis (H2): Strategic Function Deployment
Different types of strategic communications will emphasize different framing functions based on their communication goals and audience targeting.

**Falsifiable Prediction**: Campaign communications will emphasize different functions than policy advocacy, which will differ from crisis communications.

### Tertiary Hypothesis (H3): Message Completeness Variation
Communications will show varying levels of completeness across the four framing functions, revealing strategic choices about which functions to emphasize or omit.

**Falsifiable Prediction**: High-completeness messages will show balanced scores across all functions, while strategic messages will show selective function emphasis.

## Experimental Design

### Framework Application
The Entman Framing Functions Framework v10.0 will analyze discourse across four independent dimensions:
1. **Problem Definition**: Issue identification, crisis framing, scope setting
2. **Causal Attribution**: Responsibility assignment, blame attribution, causal explanation
3. **Moral Evaluation**: Value invocation, moral judgment, ethical framework
4. **Treatment Recommendation**: Solution advocacy, policy options, action imperatives

### Analysis Methodology
- **Dual-Track Scoring**: Function intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience assessment (0.0-1.0)
- **Independence Testing**: Empirical validation of Entman's framing function independence hypothesis
- **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: Classification of communication approaches based on function emphasis

### Expected Outcomes
- Quantification of framing function deployment across strategic communications
- Testing of framing function independence hypothesis
- Identification of strategic communication patterns
- Validation of systematic framing analysis methodology

## Corpus Rationale

The selected corpus will include diverse strategic communications that are likely to deploy framing functions:
- Political campaign messages with varying strategic goals
- Corporate communications addressing different stakeholder concerns
- Crisis management statements with different communication objectives
- Policy advocacy communications targeting different audiences

This corpus design will provide sufficient variation to test the framework's ability to distinguish between independent framing functions while maintaining analytical coherence.

## Success Criteria

1. **Framework-Corpus Fit**: The framework should demonstrate strong fit with the selected corpus, indicating appropriate analytical domain alignment.

2. **Function Independence**: Statistical analysis should reveal low correlations between framing functions, supporting Entman's independence hypothesis.

3. **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: The framework should identify distinct communication profiles based on framing function emphasis patterns.

4. **Message Completeness Assessment**: The framework should successfully measure how comprehensively communications address the complete framing spectrum.

## Methodological Notes

This experiment will use the Discernus platform's 3-run median aggregation system to reduce interpretive variance and improve analytical rigor. The framework's focus on independent analytical dimensions makes it particularly suitable for testing variance reduction in strategic communication analysis.

The experiment will provide empirical validation of Entman's framing theory while demonstrating the utility of systematic communication analysis in political and strategic communication research.
