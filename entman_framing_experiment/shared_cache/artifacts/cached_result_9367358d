      "description": "The experiment's hypotheses (H1, H2) require statistical analyses, including correlation and group comparisons, which are not valid for the provided corpus size of N=4. Hypothesis 2 requires comparing communication types (e.g., 'campaign', 'policy', 'crisis'), but the corpus manifest provides only one document per group (n=1). The experiment specification v10.0 prohibits inferential testing on groups smaller than n=2 and recommends N>=10 for even descriptive statistical analysis.",
      "impact": "The experiment will fail coherence validation because the primary and secondary hypotheses cannot be tested as designed. The requested statistical analyses are underpowered and cannot be executed on single-observation groups, preventing the experiment from achieving its stated goals.",
      "fix": "Align the corpus size with the experimental goals. Either expand the corpus manifest to include a sufficient number of documents (e.g., N>10, with at least n=3 per group to be compared) or revise the experiment's hypotheses to focus on qualitative, case-study analysis appropriate for a small-N corpus.",

While the machine-readable manifest is authoritative for execution, this discrepancy creates significant confusion about the experiment's scope.",
      "impact": "This internal contradiction within `corpus.md` indicates a serious documentation or configuration error. It is the likely source of the blocking sample size issue, suggesting the experiment was designed for a larger corpus than was provided in the manifest.",
      "fix": "Reconcile the narrative and the YAML manifest in `corpus.md`. If 15 documents are intended for analysis, add the remaining 11 to the YAML `documents` list and update `total_documents`. If only 4 documents are intended, revise the narrative section to accurately reflect the 4-document corpus.",
