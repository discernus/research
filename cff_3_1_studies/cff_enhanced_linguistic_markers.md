# CFF v3.1: Enhanced Linguistic Markers Framework
## Cohesive Flourishing Framework with Expanded Detection Precision

**Version**: 3.1 (Enhanced Linguistic Markers Fork)  
**Base Framework**: CFF v3.0 with Integrated Cohesion Index  
**Innovation Focus**: Significantly expanded and refined linguistic markers for improved computational detection  

---

## Framework Overview

CFF v3.1 maintains the theoretical architecture of CFF v3.0 while dramatically expanding linguistic marker precision across all axes. This fork addresses computational detection challenges through comprehensive marker expansion rather than theoretical modification.

**Core Preservation**: All theoretical foundations, axis definitions, layer structure, and mathematical formulations remain unchanged from CFF v3.0.

**Enhancement Focus**: 4x expansion of linguistic markers with enhanced granularity, specificity, and computational operationalization.
