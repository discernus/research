The hope is for a political renewal that prioritizes American citizens and reduces immigration, which they believe undermines national prosperity. While they express some optimism about changing dynamics in political debate ('progress' within the party), the overall tone is marked by a sense of cultural and economic threat, portraying immigration as harmful to societal well-being. There is significant emphasis on traditional values, patriotism, and a return to an 'America First' agenda. The text suggests a belief that national strength and prosperity stem from citizens' deep connection to their homeland and that current policies threaten this.

It highlights the concentration of wealth and power among a small elite and advocates for a system that supports the wider population. This stance aligns with a **Progressive** political worldview, which often focuses on social equity, economic justice, and reducing the influence of the wealthy in governance.\n\n### Step 2: Score the Text on the Five CFF Axes\n\n- **identity_axis**: The text emphasizes the collective identity of \"the American people\" in opposition to a small oligarchic elite. This reflects a strong emphasis on collective identity and shared struggle.\n  - **Score**: +0.8\n\n- **fear_hope_axis**: The text presents a hopeful vision of overcoming oligarchy and achieving a just nation, although it acknowledges current challenges and dangers.\n  - **Score**: +0.6\n\n- **envy_compersion_axis**: The text does not express envy but rather a strong criticism of greed and a call for fairness. It advocates for shared prosperity rather than begrudging wealth.\n  - **Score**: +0.5\n\n- **enmity_amity_axis**: The text contains strong language against the oligarchs and the wealthy, portraying them in a negative light.

The speech emphasizes unity, respect for democratic processes, and admiration for the achievement of the opponent. These values resonate largely with a conservative worldview, which is characterized by respect for tradition, a sense of duty to one's nation, and a general appeal to collective unity. Therefore, the political worldview of this text is \"Conservative\".\n\n### Step 2: Score the Text on All Five CFF Axes\n\nBased on the speech, I will assign scores on each of the five CFF axes:\n\n- **identity_axis**: The speaker highlights the unity and shared identity of all Americans, regardless of their political affiliations. (+0.8)\n\n- **fear_hope_axis**: The speech is hopeful, urging supporters to look forward to a collaborative future despite disappointment. (+0.7)\n\n- **envy_compersion_axis**: The speaker admires and congratulates the opponent, demonstrating an acknowledgment and celebration of the opponent's success. (+0.9)\n\n- **enmity_amity_axis**: The speech encourages reconciliation and support for the new president, promoting a spirit of amity. (+0.9)\n\n- **goal_axis**: The speech underscores goals of unity, collective progress, and national prosperity.

The speaker criticizes the influence of wealthy individuals and corporations, characterized as an oligarchy, that use their power to further their own interests at the expense of the public good. This view is characterized by advocacy for the working class and critiques of systemic inequality, which are central themes in progressive ideology.\n\n- **Identity Axis (0.8):** The text emphasizes unity across lines of identity such as race, gender, and ethnicity, while highlighting the divisions sowed by those in power. While there is a slight focus on identity issues, it largely calls for solidarity beyond these divisions, hence a strong score on the positive side.\n\n- **Fear-Hope Axis (0.7):** There is a hopeful message that change is possible through collective action and voting, despite an underlying acknowledgment of systemic corruption and challenges. This reflects a blend of recognizing current issues but maintaining a hopeful outlook, resulting in a positive score.\n\n- **Envy-Compersion Axis (-0.5):** The text holds animosity toward the oligarchy and the super-wealthy, reflecting an envious view of the unjust wealth distribution. This contributes to a negative score on this axis.\n\n- **Enmity-Amity Axis (-0.2):** While the text identifies an adversarial relationship with wealthy elites and corrupt politicians, it also calls for unity among the general population. This dual perspective tempers the negativity slightly, but the overall tone against specific groups results in a slight negative score.\n\n- **Goal Axis (0.9):** The message is clear in proposing a goal: a political movement centered on class solidarity and the election of representatives who prioritize the working class. This strong goal orientation leads to a high positive score.\n\n### Score Calculation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"analysis_text\": \"The text has a progressive worldview, emphasizing class solidarity, justice for the working class, and a critique of systemic corruption by the wealthy elite.

This is evidenced by a strong adherence to originalist interpretations of the Constitution, a firm belief in strict law enforcement (particularly regarding immigration), an emphasis on traditional values (e.g., opposition to same-sex marriage through judicial activism), and a clear critique of judicial overreach and executive discretion that is seen as undermining the rule of law. The speaker consistently advocates for a return to established norms, traditions, and the literal text of the law, portraying deviations as threats to the nation's integrity and safety.\\n\\n**Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v3.1 Scores:**\\n\\n*   **identity_axis: +0.8**\\n    The text constructs a robust and defined \\\"us\\\" identity centered around those who \\\"support and defend the Constitution\\\" (as originally understood), law-abiding citizens, and effective law enforcement. This \\\"us\\\" is contrasted sharply with various \\\"them\\\" groups: a \\\"lame duck President\\\" and his \\\"activist\\\" judicial appointees, \\\"illegal criminal aliens,\\\" and the \\\"other side of the aisle.\\\" The identity is rooted in shared adherence to specific legal and constitutional principles, creating a strong in-group cohesion (among those who agree) but also a distinct and at times hostile delineation from out-groups. The emphasis is on defending a particular national and constitutional identity.\\n\\n*   **fear_hope_axis: -0.9**\\n    The discourse is overwhelmingly driven by fear. The speaker repeatedly highlights existential threats: the Constitution being \\\"destroyed\\\" by judicial activism, the \\\"deadlocked court,\\\" and the \\\"thousands of lives\\\" lost due to unchecked \\\"criminal aliens\\\" and lax immigration policies. Vivid, graphic anecdotes of violence and tragedy (e.g., the murders of sons and daughters) are used to elicit strong emotional responses of dread and alarm. Hope is presented almost exclusively as the urgent necessity to combat these pervasive threats by restoring law and order, rather than a positive vision of future collective flourishing.\\n\\n*   **envy_compersion_axis: -0.9**\\n    The text is characterized by intense resentment and grievance. There is palpable envy/resentment directed at perceived abuses of power by the judiciary (writing law, manufacturing rights), executive overreach (amnesty by executive edict, prosecutorial discretion), and the perceived impunity of \\\"illegal criminal aliens.\\\" The speaker expresses deep frustration and anger that these actors are undermining the system without consequence, leading to loss of life and a breakdown of foundational principles. There are no elements of compersion or shared joy.\\n\\n*   **enmity_amity_axis: -0.9**\\n    The discourse fosters a strong sense of enmity. The text clearly identifies adversaries: the President, specific Supreme Court justices, \\\"activists,\\\" and \\\"illegal criminal aliens,\\\" whose actions are depicted as directly harmful and destructive. The \\\"other side of the aisle\\\" is implicitly or explicitly accused of failing to uphold their duty or actively working against the nation's interests. The language is confrontational and accusatory, portraying a battle where adherence to the speaker's interpretation of the law is pitted against those who deviate, with little room for amity or cooperation across ideological lines.\\n\\n*   **goal_axis: +0.7**\\n    The primary goals articulated are deeply rooted in the preservation and restoration of a perceived traditional order. These include: returning to the \\\"original meaning\\\" and \\\"text\\\" of the Constitution, ensuring strict enforcement of existing laws (especially immigration laws), securing national borders, and re-establishing accountability and the \\\"rule of law.\\\" The objective is to protect the nation from internal and external threats by reinforcing established structures and principles, rather than promoting radical change or expansive new rights.
