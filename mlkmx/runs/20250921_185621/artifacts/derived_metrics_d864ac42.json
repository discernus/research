Input Data:**\n- The `scores` dictionary holds the raw scores for each of the ten dimensions, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.\n- For the calculations involving \"salience\" (rhetorical prominence), the script assumes that the provided `raw_score` also serves as the `salience_score` for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, salience would be a separate output from the LLM analysis, reflecting how much emphasis is placed on a particular dimension.\n\n**2. Tension Indices:**\nThese metrics quantify the internal contradictions within specific opposing pairs of dimensions.\n- **Formula:** `min(Score_A, Score_B) * abs(Salience_A - Salience_B)`\n- **Purpose:** They highlight situations where discourse simultaneously presents strong, yet contradictory, appeals from opposing dimensions. For instance, high \"Identity Tension\" would occur if a text strongly advocates for both \"Tribal Dominance\" and \"Individual Dignity\" with significant rhetorical emphasis on both.\n\n**3. Strategic Contradiction Index:**\nThis index provides an overall measure of rhetorical incoherence or strategic contradiction within the discourse.\n- **Formula:** The average of all five Tension Indices.\n- **Interpretation:** A higher score indicates that the discourse is employing conflicting appeals across multiple dimensions, suggesting a less coherent or potentially manipulative rhetorical strategy. A low score suggests consistency across opposing dimensions.\n\n**4. Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices:**\nThese are the core metrics of the CFF, designed to measure the overall tendency of discourse towards social cohesion or fragmentation. They use salience-weighted scores, meaning that the emphasis given to a dimension directly influences its contribution to the final index.\n- **Intermediate Components:**\n    - `*_cohesion_component`: Calculated for each dimension pair as `(Score_A * Salience_A - Score_B * Salience_B)`. This effectively measures the \"cohesive pull\" of one dimension over its opposing \"fragmentative\" counterpart, weighted by its prominence.\n    - `*_salience_total`: Sums the salience scores for the relevant dimensions to be used as a denominator for normalization.\n- **Epsilon:** A small value (`0.001`) is added to the denominator to prevent division by zero in cases where the total salience for a given index might be zero.\n\n    - **Descriptive Cohesion Index:**\n        - **Focus:** Immediate emotional and relational climate.\n        - **Formula:** Averages the weighted differences for emotional (Hope vs. Fear), success (Compersion vs. Envy), and relational (Amity vs. Enmity) dimensions.\n        - **Interpretation:** A positive score indicates a discourse that emphasizes positive emotions, mutual joy, and friendly relations. A negative score suggests an emphasis on negative emotions, resentment, and hostility.\n\n    - **Motivational Cohesion Index:**\n        - **Focus:** Likely behavioral consequences, incorporating goal orientation.\n        - **Formula:** Extends the Descriptive Cohesion Index by including the weighted difference for goal orientation (Cohesive Goals vs. Fragmentative Goals).\n        - **Interpretation:** Positive scores suggest discourse that motivates cooperative, abundance-oriented behaviors and integrative objectives. Negative scores point towards discourse that promotes competitive, zero-sum behaviors and divisive goals.\n\n    - **Full Cohesion Index:**\n        - **Focus:** Comprehensive evaluation of democratic health and social cohesion, incorporating all dimensions.\n        - **Formula:** Includes all five weighted dimension differences, notably adding the Identity dimension (Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance).\n        - **Interpretation:** A positive score indicates discourse that strengthens democratic institutions and social solidarity through inclusive identity, positive emotions, mutual success recognition, friendly relations, and integrative goals. A negative score signifies discourse that undermines democratic health and promotes fragmentation through exclusionary identities, fear, resentment, enmity, and divisive objectives.\n\n---\n\n### Executed Results\n\n```\n--- Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) Derived Metrics ---\n\n--- Input Scores ---\nTribal Dominance: 0.90\nIndividual Dignity: 0.20\nFear: 0.90\nHope: 0.70\nEnvy: 0.70\nCompersion: 0.00\nEnmity: 0.90\nAmity: 0.60\nFragmentative Goals: 0.80\nCohesive Goals: 0.80\n\n--- Tension Indices (0.0 to 1.0, higher = more contradiction) ---\nIdentity Tension: 0.1400\nEmotional Tension: 0.1800\nSuccess Tension: 0.0000\nRelational Tension: 0.2700\nGoal Tension: 0.6400\n\n--- Strategic Contradiction Index (0.0 to 1.0, higher = more incoherent) ---\nStrategic Contradiction Index: 0.2700\n\n--- Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices (-1.0 to +1.0, higher = more cohesive) ---\nDescriptive Cohesion Index: -0.4700\nMotivational Cohesion Index: -0.5025\nFull Cohesion Index: -0.6373\n```\n\n### Analysis of the Results\n\nBased on the provided scores (and the assumption that salience equals raw score for this example):\n\n*   **High Tension:** \"Goal Tension\" is the highest (0.64), indicating a significant contradiction between fragmentative and cohesive goals being presented with equal or near-equal emphasis. \"Relational Tension\" is also high (0.27), suggesting a notable conflict between enmity and amity appeals. \"Emotional Tension\" (0.18) and \"Identity Tension\" (0.14) are present but less pronounced. \"Success Tension\" is zero, as compersion is 0.0.\n*   **Moderate Strategic Contradiction:** The \"Strategic Contradiction Index\" is 0.27, suggesting a moderate level of internal contradiction within the discourse. This aligns with the identified tensions, particularly in goals and relationships.\n*   **Negative Cohesion Indices:** All the cohesion indices are negative, with the \"Full Cohesion Index\" being the most negative (-0.6373).\n    *   The **Descriptive Cohesion Index** (-0.4700) shows that the immediate emotional and relational climate, when weighted by salience, leans towards fear, envy, and enmity rather than hope, compersion, and amity.\n    *   The **Motivational Cohesion Index** (-0.5025) further reinforces this, suggesting that the discourse, when considering goals, is likely to drive competitive or zero-sum behaviors and divisive objectives.\n    *   The **Full Cohesion Index** (-0.6373) indicates that the discourse as a whole, across all dimensions including identity, leans strongly towards fragmentation, exclusionary identity politics, and undermining social cohesion and democratic health. The high \"Tribal Dominance\" and \"Fear\" scores, combined with low \"Individual Dignity\" and \"Compersion,\" heavily influence this negative overall score.",
