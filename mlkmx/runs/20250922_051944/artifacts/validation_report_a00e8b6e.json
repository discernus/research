However, the provided framework is identified as `Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.2`. This filename mismatch will prevent the system from locating and loading the correct framework file.",
      "impact": "This is a critical execution failure. The experiment will crash at startup because the orchestrator will be unable to find the required framework file.",
      "fix": "In the `experiment.md` file, update the YAML appendix to point to the correct filename for the framework specification. Change `framework: \"cff_v10.md\"` to the actual name of the file containing the CFF v10.2 specification.",

      "description": "The experiment's prose section specifies the use of `Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0`, but the provided framework specification is version `10.2.0`. This inconsistency between the experiment's narrative and its components creates ambiguity.",
      "impact": "This discrepancy reduces the clarity and reproducibility of the research design. While likely not a breaking change, it is a specification compliance issue that should be resolved for scholarly rigor.",
      "fix": "In the `experiment.md` file, update the prose under the `Methodology` section to reflect the correct framework version. Change `Framework: Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0` to `Framework: Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.2`.",

  "suggestions": [
    "The experiment will use the 'default' analysis variant, which analyzes all 10 dimensions simultaneously. For a complex framework like CFF, consider using a multi-stage analysis that leverages the 'sequential_*' analysis variants defined in the framework. This approach, which analyzes one conceptual pair at a time, is a recommended best practice that can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of the results."
