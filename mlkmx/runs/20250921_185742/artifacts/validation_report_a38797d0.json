      "description": "The corpus manifest YAML structure uses a flat format for document metadata (e.g., 'speaker', 'year' at the top level), while the v8.0.2 corpus specification also shows an example with a nested 'metadata' object. While the provided flat structure is supported and will not cause an execution failure, adopting the nested 'metadata' structure is the recommended best practice for future-proofing and consistency.",
      "impact": "The current structure is functional but deviates from the preferred best practice, which may affect compatibility with future tooling that expects a standardized nested metadata block.",
      "fix": "In 'corpus.md', restructure the YAML for each document to group custom fields under a 'metadata' key. For example: `document_id: 'malcolm_x_ballot_bullet_1964', metadata: { speaker: 'Malcolm X', year: 1964, ... }`.",

      "description": "There is a minor mismatch between the human-readable corpus name and the machine-readable name in the corpus manifest.",
      "impact": "This has no impact on execution but can cause minor confusion for researchers reviewing the files. The machine-readable name is used as the identifier in logs and outputs.",
      "fix": "In 'corpus.md', ensure the human-readable markdown header (`# MLK-MX Civil Rights Speeches Corpus`) and the machine-readable YAML `name` field (`name: \"mlkmx_civil_rights_speeches\"`) are aligned for clarity.",

    "The overall experiment is exceptionally well-structured. The framework's use of sequential analysis prompts and detailed dimensional markers is a best practice that will likely lead to high-quality, reliable results.",
    "The corpus is perfectly suited for the framework and the experiment's comparative case study design (N=2), demonstrating strong trinity coherence."
