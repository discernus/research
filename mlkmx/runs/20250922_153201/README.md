# Discernus Research Run

**Complete Research Package - mlkmx**

**Run ID**: 20250922_153201  
**Generated**: 2025-09-22 15:32:01 UTC

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### `artifacts/` - Complete Provenance Chain
- **Input Snapshots** (exact versions used in this run):
  - `experiment_497e0ca6.md` - **SNAPSHOT**: Exact version of experiment.md used
  - `framework_17304ad3.md` - **SNAPSHOT**: Exact version of framework file used
  - `corpus_eefdeaaf.md` - **SNAPSHOT**: Exact version of corpus.md used
- **Analysis Artifacts**: Raw LLM outputs, processing plans, statistical results
- **Evidence Artifacts**: Curated supporting evidence and quotes
- **Report Artifacts**: Synthesis outputs and final reports

### `logs/` - Execution Logs
- `agents.jsonl` - Agent execution details and decisions
- `costs.jsonl` - API usage and cost tracking
- `system.jsonl` - System events and operations
- `llm_interactions.jsonl` - Complete LLM conversation history

### `results/` - Research Outputs (if present)
- `scores.csv` - Analysis scores and derived metrics
- `evidence.csv` - Supporting evidence with quotes
- `metadata.csv` - Document and run metadata
- `final_report.md` - Complete synthesis report

## üîç Quick Start

### For Data Analysis
- Check `results/` directory for CSV files ready for statistical analysis
- Use `artifacts/` for detailed analysis artifacts and provenance

### For Replication
- Use snapshot files in `artifacts/` to see exact input versions
- All necessary files for complete replication are preserved

### For Audit
- Review `logs/` for complete execution trace
- Check `artifacts/` for full provenance chain
- Verify input snapshots match original files using hash verification

## üìã Provenance Verification

This run used exact versions of input files (see snapshots in `artifacts/`).

To verify a snapshot matches the original:
```bash
# Example verification
sha256sum artifacts/experiment_497e0ca6.md.md
# Compare with: sha256sum ../../experiment.md
```

All files are content-addressable and fully traceable through the artifact system.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This run was generated using the Discernus V2 system with:
- **THIN Architecture**: Minimal orchestration, agent-native design
- **Content-Addressable Storage**: All artifacts stored with SHA-256 hashes
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every operation logged and tracked
- **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies for replication
