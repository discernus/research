### **Research Report: A Framework-Driven Analysis of Rhetorical Strategies in Civil Rights Discourse**

**Experiment ID:** mlkmx

### 1. Executive Summary

This report outlines a computational analysis of two seminal texts from the American civil rights movement—Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from Birmingham Jail" (1963) and Malcolm X's "The Ballot or the Bullet" (1964)—using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. The central objective of the experiment is to leverage the CFF's multi-dimensional measurement capabilities to quantify and compare the distinct rhetorical strategies employed by these two influential leaders. Lacking the final statistical output, this report establishes the theoretical and methodological foundation for that analysis, formulating key hypotheses and detailing the analytical plan to be executed upon receipt of the data.

The core analytical thesis to be tested is that the CFF can empirically validate and add nuance to the established scholarly understanding of King's rhetoric as fundamentally cohesive and integrative, and Malcolm X's as strategically fragmentative and confrontational. For instance, King's vision of interconnectedness is powerfully articulated when he states: "We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly." (Source: 6a007eb9). In stark contrast, Malcolm X's call for radical change is encapsulated in his assertion: "Revolutions overturn systems. Revolutions destroy systems." (Source: 400e1c91). We anticipate that statistical analysis will reveal significant divergence between the two texts across all five of the framework's primary axes (Identity, Emotional Climate, Success Orientation, Relational Climate, Goal Orientation). Specifically, it is hypothesized that King's text will yield significantly higher scores on the `Full Cohesion Index`, driven by strong performance on dimensions like `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals`. Conversely, Malcolm X's text is expected to score negatively on this index, reflecting high scores in `Tribal Dominance`, `Enmity`, and `Fear`.

The analysis is designed to rigorously test the CFF's performance, particularly its novel constructs of `Salience` and `Rhetorical Tension`. By examining the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, we can investigate the degree to which each speaker employed mixed messaging, a key feature the CFF is designed to capture. The experiment's primary significance lies in its potential to demonstrate the CFF's utility as a tool for generating replicable, quantitative data from complex historical texts, thereby providing an empirical backbone for qualitative scholarly interpretation. The findings, once generated, are expected to contribute to the fields of political communication, rhetorical analysis, and computational social science by showcasing a methodology that preserves rhetorical nuance while enabling systematic comparison.

### 2. Framework Analysis & Performance

#### **Framework Architecture**

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4 is a computational discourse analysis methodology designed to quantify rhetorical patterns associated with social cohesion and democratic discourse quality. Its intellectual purpose is to address the "information loss problem" in traditional content analysis, which often forces texts into simplistic, mutually exclusive categories (e.g., hopeful vs. fearful). The CFF's core innovation is the independent scoring of ten dimensions organized into five opposing pairs (e.g., `Hope` vs. `Fear`, `Amity` vs. `Enmity`) on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale. This structure is grounded in social psychology and political communication theory, acknowledging that sophisticated rhetoric can simultaneously employ competing appeals. For example, Martin Luther King Jr. masterfully navigates the creation of tension for a higher purpose, stating: "Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive... so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood." (Source: 6a007eb9).

The framework's novelty is further enhanced by its distinction between `intensity` (the raw score of a dimension) and `salience` (the rhetorical prominence of that dimension). This dual-track analysis, combined with derived metrics like the `Tension Indices` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, allows for a nuanced measurement of rhetorical coherence and strategic ambiguity. The framework's three composite `Cohesion Indices` (`Descriptive`, `Motivational`, `Full`) are designed with normative transparency, escalating from descriptive measurement to analytical prediction and finally to normative evaluation, grounded in deliberative democratic theory. This layered approach allows researchers to select the appropriate level of analysis while making normative assumptions explicit.

#### **Statistical Validation: Anticipated Patterns**

The framework's theoretical structure posits that opposing dimensions (e.g., `Amity` and `Enmity`) are conceptually distinct but not necessarily mutually exclusive in their manifestation. Statistical validation would involve examining the correlations between these pairs across the corpus.

*   **Anticipated Pattern 1: Negative Correlations within Pairs.** We would expect to observe moderate to strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions (e.g., a negative Pearson's *r* between `Hope` and `Fear` scores). A perfect correlation of *r* = -1.0 would suggest the dimensions are not truly independent, while a correlation near 0 would challenge the framework's theoretical pairing. A moderate negative correlation (*r* between -0.4 and -0.7) would validate the framework's design, indicating that while the concepts are opposed, they can co-exist.
*   **Anticipated Pattern 2: Validation of Cohesion Indices.** The three `Cohesion Indices` are structured hierarchically. We would expect the scores for each text to show a logical progression. For King's text, we hypothesize that the index value will become more positive (or remain highly positive) as we move from the `Descriptive` to the `Motivational` and `Full` indices. For Malcolm X
