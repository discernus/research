      "description": "The framework specification `cff_v10_4.md` uses a section named `required_calculations` to define its derived metrics. The v10.0 Framework Specification standard uses the section name `derived_metrics` for this purpose. Additionally, the framework's `output_schema` requires an object in the final output named `derived_metrics`, creating a naming inconsistency between the section defining the formulas (`required_calculations`) and the final output structure.",
      "impact": "This is a minor non-compliance with the naming convention in the v10.0 specification's examples. It does not block execution, as the system can locate and parse the calculation definitions, but it may cause confusion for developers or automated tools expecting the standard section name.",
      "fix": "For full compliance with the v10.0 specification's naming conventions and internal consistency, consider renaming the `required_calculations` section in the framework's YAML appendix to `derived_metrics`.",

    "The experiment design is excellent, correctly identifying a 'Comparative Case Analysis' as the appropriate methodology for a corpus of N=2, which aligns with the v10.0 specification guidelines (N<4).",
    "The CFF v10.4 framework is exceptionally well-designed and includes pre-defined sequential analysis variants (`sequential_identity`, `sequential_emotional`, etc.). While the 'default' variant is comprehensive, orchestrating a multi-pass analysis using these sequential variants could improve analytical accuracy and consistency, as recommended in the framework's own documentation ('Sequential Analysis Strategies')."
