  "evidence_extraction": "[\n  \"[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I am here in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the view which argues against 'outsiders coming in.']\",\n  \"[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea.]\",\n  \"[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible 'devil.']\",\n  \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust.]\",\n  \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an 'I it' relationship for an 'I thou' relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things.]\",\n  \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.]\",\n  \"[FEAR: But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters;]\",\n  \"[FEAR: when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people;]\",\n  \"[FEAR: when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of 'nobodiness'--then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at present misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.]\",\n  \"[MUDITA: I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis.]\",\n  \"[MUDITA: I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.]\",\n  \"[MUDITA: I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it.]\",\n  \"[ENMITY: It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.]\",\n  \"[ENMITY: I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice;]\",\n  \"[ENMITY: I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail;]\",\n  \"[AMITY: My Dear Fellow Clergymen: While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities 'unwise and untimely.' Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.]\",\n  \"[AMITY: Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.]\",\n  \"[AMITY: so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.]\",\n  \"[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.]\",\n  \"[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth.]\",\n  \"[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.]\",\n  \"[COHESIVE_GOALS: The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation.]\",\n  \"[COHESIVE_GOALS: Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.]\",\n  \"[COHESIVE_GOALS: If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me. I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.]\"\n]\nTotal quotes in the composite analysis: 28\nTotal quotes in your output: 28",
