      "description": "The 'default' analysis prompt in the framework's machine-readable appendix contains a potentially confusing instruction regarding the output schema. It states 'You must provide both dimensional_scores AND derived_metrics in your response. The derived_metrics are calculated automatically based on your dimensional scores, but you must include both sections in your JSON output.' This creates ambiguity for the analyzing agent.",
      "impact": "The LLM agent may misinterpret this instruction and attempt to calculate the derived metrics itself. If its calculation method differs from the system's official formula engine, this could lead to inconsistent or incorrect derived metric values, compromising result reproducibility. At minimum, it causes redundant computation.",
      "fix": "Clarify the 'analysis_prompt' for the 'default' variant in 'cff_v10_4.md'. The instruction should unambiguously state that the agent is ONLY responsible for generating the 'dimensional_scores' object. A clearer instruction would be: 'Your JSON output must contain a `dimensional_scores` object with your analysis. The system will automatically calculate and append the `derived_metrics` object based on your scores.'",

    "The experiment design is exceptionally coherent, with a strong alignment between the research questions, the high-quality CFF v10.4 framework, and the well-chosen corpus. The use of a comparative case study (N=2) is appropriate and aligns with platform guidance for small sample sizes."
