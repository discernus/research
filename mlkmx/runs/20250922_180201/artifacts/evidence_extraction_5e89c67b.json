We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\",\n  \"Any law that uplifts [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: human personality] is just. Any law that degrades [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: human personality] is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality.\",\n  \"Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: human dignity].\",\n  \"If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be [FEAR: flowing with blood].\",\n  \"millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a [FEAR: frightening racial nightmare].\",\n  \"But when you have seen [FEAR: vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters]; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an [FEAR: airtight cage of poverty] in the midst of an affluent society;\",\n  \"I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.\",\n  \"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.\",\n  \"I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at present misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. ... If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail.\",\n  \"No direct evidence of resentment towards others' success or zero-sum thinking, rather a critique of systemic injustice and privilege.\",\n  \"The framework's definition of 'envy' (resentment toward others' success) is not met, as the critique is of systemic injustice and not the prosperity of others.\",\n  \"MLK criticizes 'privileged groups' for maintaining their privileges, but this is a critique of a system of injustice, not a 'didn't earn it' or 'taking our share' mentality.\",\n  \"I am thankful, however, that some of our [MUDITA: white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it]. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big in quality.\",\n  \"I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.\",\n  \"I wish you had [MUDITA: commended the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation].\",\n  \"I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the [ENMITY: white moderate]. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the [ENMITY: white moderate], who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice;\",\n  \"Where were their voices when the lips of [ENMITY: Governor Barnett] dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when [ENMITY: Governor Wallace] gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred?\",\n  \"if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys\",\n  \"My Dear Fellow Clergymen:\",\n  \"I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.\",\n  \"I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a [AMITY: fellow clergyman and a Christian brother]. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of [AMITY: love and brotherhood] will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.\",\n  \"The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: black nationalist groups] that are springing up across the nation... [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible 'devil'.]\",\n  \"if our white brothers dismiss as 'rabble rousers' and 'outside agitators' those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: frightening racial nightmare].\",\n  \"So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?\",\n  \"so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of [COHESIVE_GOALS: understanding and brotherhood].\",\n  \"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of [COHESIVE_GOALS: brotherhood]. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of [COHESIVE_GOALS: human dignity].\",\n  \"One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.\"\n]\nTotal quotes in the analysis result: 30\nTotal quotes in the output: 30",
