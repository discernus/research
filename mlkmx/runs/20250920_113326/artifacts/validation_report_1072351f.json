      "description": "There is a spelling inconsistency for 'Malcolm X' in the corpus manifest (`corpus.md`). The `speaker` field is spelled correctly as 'Malcolm X', but the `filename` field uses 'malcom_x' (missing the second 'l').",
      "impact": "While this does not block execution as long as the file path points to an existing file, it creates inconsistency within the corpus metadata. This can lead to confusion for researchers and potential errors in manual data handling or future scripts that might assume a consistent naming convention.",
      "fix": "To improve data quality and consistency, standardize the spelling. It is recommended to rename the file to `corpus/malcolm_x_ballot_or_bullet.txt` and update the `filename` field in `corpus.md` to match.",
