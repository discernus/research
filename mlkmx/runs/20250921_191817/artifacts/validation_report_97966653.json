    "The CFF v10.0 framework provides multiple sequential analysis variants (e.g., 'sequential_identity', 'sequential_emotional') which are recommended for complex frameworks with 5 or more dimensions to improve analytical quality and reduce cognitive load on the model. Consider leveraging these variants for potentially more accurate and reliable results."
