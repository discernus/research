As a statistical analysis expert, I will generate and execute Python code to perform a comprehensive analysis of the provided dimensional scores based on the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0.\n\n### **Executive Summary of Analysis**\n\nThis report details the statistical analysis of two documents scored using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0. The analysis proceeds in four stages:\n\n1.  **Data Preparation**: The provided scores were loaded, and the derived metrics specified by the CFF (Tension Indices, Strategic Contradiction, and Cohesion Indices) were calculated.\n2.  **Descriptive Statistics**: A summary of central tendency and dispersion was generated for all primary and derived dimensions.\n3.  **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation matrix was computed and visualized to explore the relationships between the different rhetorical dimensions.\n4.  **Interpretation of Findings**: The statistical results were interpreted in the context of the CFF's theoretical foundations.\n\n**Key Findings:**\nThe analysis reveals two distinct rhetorical profiles.\n*   **Document 0** exhibits a highly contradictory and fragmentative profile. It scores high on negative dimensions like `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity`, but simultaneously employs powerful cohesive rhetoric (`hope`, `amity`, `cohesive_goals`). This results in extremely high tension scores and a near-zero `full_cohesion_index`, indicating a strategically incoherent or \"mixed-message\" discourse.\n*   **Document 1** presents a much more coherent and cohesive profile. It is characterized by high scores in `individual_dignity`, `hope`, and `cohesive_goals`, with low scores in fragmentative dimensions. This results in low tension and a strongly positive `full_cohesion_index`, indicating discourse aligned with social flourishing.\n\n**Critical Limitation:** The analysis is based on a sample size of **N=2**. This is too small for inferential statistics (e.g., t-tests, p-value significance). The findings, particularly the correlations, are purely descriptive of this specific dataset and cannot be generalized to a wider population of texts. They serve as a demonstration of the analytical method rather than a conclusive study.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code for CFF Analysis**\n\nThe following Python code performs the full analysis. It is self-contained and uses standard data science libraries.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# --- 1.
