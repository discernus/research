We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.\",\n  \"Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality.\",\n  \"Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an 'I it' relationship for an 'I thou' relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things.\",\n  \"But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters...\",\n  \"when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society...\",\n  \"There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair.\",\n  \"Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.\",\n  \"We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.\",\n  \"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.\",\n  \"Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.\",\n  \"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice...\",\n  \"Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state's segregation laws was democratically elected?\",\n  \"I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.\",\n  \"I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big in quality.\",\n  \"I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation.\",\n  \"It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.\",\n  \"Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred?\",\n  \"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\",\n  \"My Dear Fellow Clergymen:\",\n  \"But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.\",\n  \"I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother.\",\n  \"In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy.\",\n  \"The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence... this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America... and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible 'devil.' I have tried to stand between these two forces...\",\n  \"Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.\",\n  \"The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.\",\n  \"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood.\"\n]\n```",
