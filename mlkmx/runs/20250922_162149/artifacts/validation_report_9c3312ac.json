      "description": "The 'default' analysis prompt in the framework specification (`cff_v10_4.md`) creates a contradiction for the analysis agent. It states that `derived_metrics` are 'calculated automatically' but then mandates that the agent must include this section in its output to conform to the framework's `output_schema`.",
      "impact": "This ambiguity increases the risk of the analysis agent failing to produce schema-compliant output, which could halt the experiment at the results validation stage. While a capable model may follow the complex instruction, the contradiction introduces unreliability into the workflow.",
      "fix": "Modify the `analysis_variants.default.analysis_prompt` in `cff_v10_4.md` to only require the `dimensional_scores` from the agent. The framework's `output_schema` should also be updated to make the `derived_metrics` section optional for the agent's initial output, as these metrics are intended to be calculated and validated by a separate system process.",
