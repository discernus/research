Cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and [ENMITY: I see some enemies.] [laughter, applause] In fact, [ENMITY: I think we'd be fooling ourselves if we had an audience this large and didn't realize that there were some enemies present.]\\n\\nThis afternoon we want to talk about [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the ballot or the bullet]. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The ballot or the bullet explains itself.] But before we get into it, since this is the year of the ballot or the bullet, I would like to clarify some things that refer to me personally, concerning my own personal position.\\n\\nI'm still a Muslim. That is, my religion is still Islam. [applause] My religion is still Islam. I still credit Mr. Muhammad for what I know and what I am. He's the one who opened my eyes. [applause] At present I am the minister of the newly founded Muslim Mosque Incorporated, which has its offices in the Theresa Hotel right in the heart of Harlem, that's the black belt in New York City. And when we realize that Adam Clayton Powell, is a Christian minister, he has Abyssinian Baptist Church, but at the same time he's more famous for his political struggling. And Dr. King is a Christian minister from Atlanta Georgia, or in Atlanta Georgia, but he's become more famous for being involved in the civil rights struggle. There's another in New York, Rev. Galamison, I don't know if you've heard of him out here, he's a Christian minister from Brooklyn, but has become famous for his fight against the segregated school system in Brooklyn. Rev. Cleage, right here, is a Christian minister, here in Detroit, he's head of the Freedom Now Party. All of these are Christian ministers [applause] \u2026all of these are Christian ministers but they don't come to us as Christian ministers, they come to us as fighters in some other category.\\n\\nI am a Muslim minister. The same as they are Christian ministers, I'm a Muslim minister. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: I don't believe in fighting today on any one front, but on all fronts.] [applause] In fact, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'm a Black Nationalist freedom fighter.] [applause] Islam is my religion but I believe my religion is my personal business. [applause] It governs my personal life, my personal morals. And my religious philosophy is personal between me and the God in whom I believe, just as the religious philosophy of these others is between them and the God in whom they believe. And this is best this way. Were we to come out here discussing religion, we'd have too many differences from the out start and we could never get together.\\n\\nSo today, though Islam is my religious philosophy, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my political, economic and social philosophy is black nationalism.] You and I \u2013 [applause] As I say, if we bring up religion, we'll have differences, we'll have arguments, and we'll never be able to get together. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: if we keep our religion at home, keep our religion in the closet, keep our religion between ourselves and our God, but when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us against a enemy who is common to all of us.] [applause]\\n\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The political philosophy of black nationalism only means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The time when white people can come in our community and get us to vote for them so that they can be our political leaders and tell us what to do and what not to do is long gone.] [applause]\\n\\nBy the same token, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the time when that same white man, knowing that your eyes are too far open, can send another Negro in the community, and get you and me to support him, so that he can use him to lead us astray, those days are long gone too.] [applause]\\n\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The political philosophy of black nationalism only means that if you and I are going to live in a black community \u2013 and that's where we're going to live, 'cause as soon as you move into one of their\u2026.soon as you move out of the black community into their community, it's mixed for a period of time, but they're gone and you're right there all by yourself again.] [applause]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: We must, we must understand the politics of our community and we must know what politics is supposed to produce.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must know what part politics play in our lives.] And until we become politically mature, [FEAR: we will always be misled, led astray, or deceived or maneuvered into supporting someone politically who doesn't have the good of our community at heart.] So [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the political philosophy of black nationalism only means that we will have to carry on a program, a political program, of reeducation \u2013 to open our people's eyes, make us become more politically conscious, politically mature.] And then, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we will \u2013 whenever we are ready to cast our ballot, that ballot will be cast for a man of the community, who has the good of the community at heart.] [applause]\\n\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we should own and operate and control the economy of our community.] You would never have found\u2014you can't open up a black store in a white community. White man won't even patronize you. And he's not wrong. [ENVY: He got sense enough to look out for himself. It's you who don't have sense enough to look out for yourself.] [applause]\\n\\n[ENVY: The white man, the white man is too intelligent to let someone else come and gain control of the economy of his community.] But [ENVY: you will let anybody come in and control the economy of your community, control the housing, control the education, control the jobs, control the businesses, under the pretext that you want to integrate. Nah, you're out of your mind.] [applause]\\n\\nThe political \u2026 [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to become involved in a program of reeducation, to educate our people into the importance of knowing that when you spend your dollar out of the community in which you live, the community in which you spend your money becomes richer and richer, the community out of which you take your money becomes poorer and poorer.] And because these Negroes, [FEAR: who have been misled, misguided, are breaking their necks to take their money and spend it with the Man, the Man is becoming richer and richer, and you're becoming poorer and poorer.] And then what happens? [FEAR: The community in which you live becomes a slum. It becomes a ghetto. The conditions become rundown.] And then [FEAR: you have the audacity to complain about poor housing in a rundown community, while you're running down yourselves when you take your dollar out.] [applause]\\n\\nAnd [FEAR: you and I are in a double trap] because not only do we lose by taking our money someplace else and spending it, when we try and spend it in our own community we're trapped because we haven't had sense enough to set up stores and control the businesses of our community. The man who is controlling the stores in our community is a man who doesn't look like we do. He's a man who doesn't even live in the community. So you and I, even when we try and spend our money on the block where we live or the area where we live, we're spending it with a man who, when the sun goes down, takes that basket full of money in another part of the town. [applause]\\n\\nSo [FEAR: we're trapped, trapped, double-trapped, triple-trapped. Any way we go, we find that we're trapped. Any every kind of solution that someone comes up with is just another trap.] But the political and economic philosophy of black nationalism\u2026[COHESIVE_GOALS: the economic philosophy of black nationalism shows our people the importance of setting up these little stores, and developing them and expanding them into larger operations.] [HOPE: Woolworth didn't start out big like they are today; they started out with a dime store, and expanded, and expanded, and expanded until today they are all over the country and all over the world and they getting some of everybody's money.]\\n\\nNow this is what you and I \u2013 General Motors, the same way, it didn't start out like it is. It started out just a little rat-race type operation. And it expanded and it expanded until today it's where it is right now. [HOPE: And you and I have to make a start. And the best place to start is right in the community where we live.] [applause]\\n\\nSo [COHESIVE_GOALS: our people not only have to be reeducated to the importance of supporting black business, but the black man himself has to be made aware of the importance of going into business.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: once you and I go into business, we own and operate at least the businesses in our community. What we will be doing is developing a situation, wherein, we will actually be able to create employment for the people in the community.] And [HOPE: once you can create some employment in the community where you live, it will eliminate the necessity of you and me having to act ignorantly and disgracefully, boycotting and picketing some cracker someplace else trying to beg him for a job.] [applause]\\n\\n[ENMITY: Anytime you have to rely upon your enemy for a job, you're in bad shape.] [applause] When you \u2014 [ENMITY: and he is your enemy. You wouldn't be in this country if some enemy hadn't kidnapped you and brought you here.] [applause] On the other hand, some of you think you came here on the Mayflower. [laughter]\\n\\nSo as you can see, brothers and sisters, today \u2013 this afternoon it is not our intention to discuss religion. We're going to forget religion. If we bring up religion we'll be in an argument. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: the best way to keep away from arguments and differences, as I said earlier, put your religion at home, in the closet, keep it between you and your God.] Because if it hasn't done anything more for you than it has, you need to forget it anyway. [laughter, applause]\\n\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Whether you are a Christian or a Muslim or a nationalist, we all have the same problem. They don't hang you because you're a Baptist; they hang you 'cause you're black.] [applause] [ENMITY: They don't attack me because I'm a Muslim. They attack me 'cause I'm black. They attacked all of us for the same reason. All of us catch hell from the same enemy. We're all in the same bag, in the same boat.]\\n\\n[FEAR: We suffer political oppression, economic exploitation and social degradation.] All of 'em from [ENMITY: the same enemy]. [ENMITY: The government has failed us.] You can't deny that. [ENMITY: Any time you're living in the 20th century, 1964, and you walking around here singing \\\"We Shall Overcome,\\\" the government has failed you.] [applause] [ENMITY: This is part of what's wrong with you, you do too much singing.] [laughter] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Today it's time to stop singing and start swinging.] [laughter, applause]\\n\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: You can't sing up on freedom. But you can swing up on some freedom.] [cheering] Cassius Clay can sing. But singing didn't help him to become the heavyweight champion of the world. Swinging helped him. [applause]\\n\\nSo [ENMITY: this government has failed us. The government itself has failed us. And the white liberals who have been posing as our friends have failed us.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: once we see that all of these other sources to which we've turned have failed, we stop turning to them and turn to ourselves.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need a selfhelp program, a do-it-yourself philosophy, a do-it-right-now philosophy, a it's-already-too-late philosophy.] [HOPE: This is what you and I need to get with. And the only time \u2013 the only way we're going to solve our problem is with a self-help program. Before we can get a self-help program started, we have to have a self-help philosophy. Black nationalism is a self-help philosophy.]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: What's so good about it \u2013 you can stay right in the church where you are and still take black nationalism as your philosophy.] You can stay in any kind of civic organization that you belong to and still take black nationalism as your philosophy. You can be an atheist and still take black nationalism as your philosophy. [COHESIVE_GOALS: This is a philosophy that eliminates the necessity for division and argument, 'cause if you're black, you should be thinking black.] And if you're black and you not thinking black at this late date, well, I'm sorry for you. [applause]\\n\\n[HOPE: Once you change your philosophy, you change your thought pattern. Once you change your thought pattern you change your attitude. Once you change your attitude it changes your behavior pattern. And then you go on into some action.] As long as you got a sit-down philosophy you'll have a sit-down thought pattern. And as long as you think that old sit-down thought, you'll be in some kind of sit-down action. They'll have you sitting in everywhere. [laughter]\\n\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: It's not so good to refer to what you're going to do as a sit-in. That right there castrates you. Right there it brings you down.] What goes with it? What \u2013 think of the image of someone sitting. An old woman can sit. An old man can sit. A chump can sit, a coward can sit, anything can sit. Well, you and I been sitting long enough and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's time for us today to start doing some standing and some fighting to back that up.] [applause]\\n\\nWhen we look at other parts of this Earth upon which we live, we find that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: black, brown, red and yellow people in Africa and Asia are getting their independence.] They're not getting it by singing, 'We Shall Overcome.\\\" No, they're getting it through nationalism. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It is nationalism that brought about the independence of the people in Asia.] Every nation in Asia gained its independence through the philosophy of nationalism. Every nation on the African continent that has gotten its independence brought it about through the philosophy of nationalism. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it will take black nationalism to bring about the freedom of 22 million Afro-Americans, here in this country, where we have suffered colonialism for the past 400 years.] [applause]\\n\\n[ENMITY: America is just as much a colonial power as England ever was. America is just as much a colonial power as France ever was.] In fact, [ENMITY: America is more so a colonial power than they, because she is a hypocritical colonial power behind it.] [applause] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: What is 20th \u2014 what, what do you call second-class citizenship? Why, that's colonization. Second-class citizenship is nothing but 20th slavery.] How you gonna to tell me you're a second-class citizen? [ENMITY: They don't have second-class citizenship in any other government on this Earth. They just have slaves and people who are free! Well, this country is a hypocrite!] [FEAR: They try and make you think they set you free by calling you a second-class citizen. No, you're nothing but a 20th century slave.] [applause]\\n\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Just as it took nationalism to remove colonialism from Asia and Africa, it'll take black nationalism today to remove colonialism from the backs and the minds of twenty-two million Afro-Americans here in this country.] And [HOPE: 1964 looks like it might be the year of the ballot or the bullet.] [applause]\\n\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Why does it look like it might be the year of the ballot or the bullet? Because Negroes have listened to the trickery and the lies and the false promises of the white man now for too long, and they're fed up.] They've become disenchanted. They've become disillusioned. They've become dissatisfied. And [FEAR: all of this has built up frustrations in the black community that makes the black community throughout America today more explosive than all of the atomic bombs the Russians can ever invent.] [FEAR: Whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap. When a racial powder keg goes off, it doesn't care who it knocks out the way. Understand this, it's dangerous.]\\n\\nAnd in 1964, this seems to be the year. Because [ENMITY: what can the white man use, now, to fool us? After he put down that March on Washington \u2013 and you see all through that now, he tricked you, had you marching down to Washington. Had you marching back and forth between the feet of a dead man named Lincoln and another dead man named George Washington, singing, \\\"We Shall Overcome.\\\"] [applause]\\n\\n[ENMITY: He made a chump out of you. He made a fool out of you.] [FEAR: He made you think you were going somewhere and you end up going nowhere but between Lincoln and Washington.] [laughter]\\n\\nSo today [FEAR: our people are disillusioned. They've become disenchanted. They've become dissatisfied. And in their frustrations they want action.] And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: in 1964 you'll see this young black man, this new generation, asking for the ballot or the bullet.] That old Uncle Tom action is outdated. The young generation don't want to hear anything about \\\"the odds are against us.\\\" What do we care about odds? [applause]\\n\\nWhen this country here was first being founded, there were thirteen colonies. The whites were colonized. They were fed up with this taxation without representation. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: So some of them stood up and said, \\\"Liberty or death!\\\"] I went to a white school over here in Mason, Michigan. The white man made the mistake of letting me read his history books. [laughter] He made the mistake of teaching me that Patrick Henry was a patriot, and George Washington \u2013 wasn't nothing nonviolent about ol' Pat, or George Washington. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Liberty or death\\\" is was what brought about the freedom of whites in this country from the English.] [applause]\\n\\n[HOPE: They didn't care about the odds. Why, they faced the wrath of the entire British Empire.] And in those days, they used to say that the British Empire was so vast and so powerful that the sun would never set on it. This is how big it was, yet these thirteen little scrawny states, tired of taxation without representation, [ENVY: tired of being exploited and oppressed and degraded], told that big British Empire, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: \\\"Liberty or death.\\\"] And [FEAR: here you have 22 million Afro-Americans, black people today, catching more hell than Patrick Henry ever saw.] [applause]\\n\\nAnd [HOPE: I'm here to tell you in case you don't know it \u2013 that you got a new, you got a new generation of black people in this country who don't care anything whatsoever about odds.] They don't want to hear you ol' Uncle Tom, handkerchief-heads talking about the odds. No! [laughter, applause] [HOPE: This is a new generation.] If they're going to draft these young black men, and send them over to Korea or to South Vietnam to face 800 million Chinese\u2026 [laughter, applause] [HOPE: If you're not afraid of those odds, you shouldn't be afraid of these odds.] [applause]\\n\\n[FEAR: Why is America \u2013 why does this loom to be such an explosive political year? Because this is the year of politics.] This is the year when [ENMITY: all of the white politicians are going to come into the Negro community. You never see them until election time. You can't find them until election time.] [applause] [ENMITY: They're going to come in with false promises. And as they make these false promises they're going to feed our frustrations, and this will only serve to make matters worse.]\\n\\n[ENMITY: I'm no politician. I'm not even a student of politics. I'm not a Republican, nor a Democrat, nor an American \u2013 and got sense enough to know it.] [applause]\\n\\n[ENMITY: I'm one of the 22 million black victims of the Democrats. One of the 22 million black victims of the Republicans and one of the 22 million black victims of Americanism.] [applause] And [ENMITY: when I speak, I don't speak as a Democrat or a Republican, nor an American. I speak as a victim of America's so-called democracy.] You and I have never seen democracy \u2013 [ENMITY: all we've seen is hypocrisy.] [applause]\\n\\nWhen we open our eyes today and look around America, [ENMITY: we see America not through the eyes of someone who has enjoyed the fruits of Americanism. We see America through the eyes of someone who has been the victim of Americanism.] [FEAR: We don't see any American dream. We've experienced only the American nightmare.] [ENMITY: We haven't benefited from America's democracy. We've only suffered from America's hypocrisy.] And the generation that's coming up now can see it. And are not afraid to say it. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: If you go to jail, so what? If you're black, you were born in jail.] [applause]\\n\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: If you black you were born in jail, in the North as well as the South.] Stop talking about the South. As long as you south of the Canadian border, you South. [laughter, applause] Don't call Governor Wallace a Dixie governor, Romney is a Dixie Governor. [applause]\\n\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Twenty-two million black victims of Americanism are waking up and they are gaining a new political consciousness, becoming politically mature.] And [HOPE: as they become \u2013 develop this political maturity, they're able to see the recent trends in these political elections.] They see that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the whites are so evenly divided that every time they vote, the race is so close they have to go back and count the votes all over again.] Which means that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: any block, any minority that has a block of votes that stick together is in a strategic position.] Either way you go, that's who gets it. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You're in a position to determine who'll go to the White House and who'll stay in the doghouse.] [laughter]\\n\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You're the one who has that power. You can keep Johnson in Washington D.C., or you can send him back to his Texas cotton patch.] [applause] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You're the one who sent Kennedy to Washington. You're the one who put the present Democratic administration in Washington, D.C.] The whites were evenly divided. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It was the fact that you threw 80 percent of your votes behind the Democrats that put the Democrats in the White House.]\\n\\nWhen you see this, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you can see that the Negro vote is the key factor.] And despite the fact that you are in a position to be the determining factor, [ENVY: what do you get out of it? The Democrats have been in Washington, D.C. only because of the Negro vote.] They've been down there four years. And they're \u2013 all other legislation they wanted to bring up they've brought it up, and gotten it out of the way, and [ENMITY: now they bring up you. And now they bring up you! You put them first and they put you last. Because you're a chump!] [applause] [ENMITY: A political chump.]\\n\\nIn Washington, D.C., in the House of Representatives there are 257 who are Democrats. Only 177 are Republican. In the Senate there are 67 Democrats. Only 33 are Republicans. [ENMITY: The party that you backed controls two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate and still they can't keep their promise to you. 'Cause you're a chump.] [applause]\\n\\n[ENMITY: Any time you throw your weight behind a political party that controls two-thirds of the government, and that party can't keep the promise that it made to you during election-time, and you're dumb enough to walk around continuing to identify yourself with that party, you're not only a chump but you're a traitor to your race.] [applause]\\n\\nWhat kind of alibi do come up with? [ENMITY: They try and pass the buck to the Dixiecrats. Now, back during the days when you were blind, deaf and dumb, ignorant, politically immature, naturally you went along with that.] But today, as your eyes come open, and [HOPE: you develop political maturity, you're able to see and think for yourself], and you can see that [ENMITY: a Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat \u2013 in disguise.] [applause]\\n\\n[ENMITY: You look at the structure of the government that controls this country, is controlled by 16 senatorial committees and 20 congressional committees. Of the 16 senatorial committees that run the government, 10 of them are in the hands of southern segregationists. Of the 20 congressional committees that run the government, 12 of them are in the hands of southern segregationists. And they're going to tell you and me that the South lost the war?] [laughter, applause]\\n\\n[ENMITY: You, today, are in the hands of a government of segregationists. Racists, white supremacists, who belong to the Democratic party but disguise themselves as Dixiecrats. A Dixiecrat is nothing but a Democrat. Whoever runs the Democrats is also the father of the Dixiecrats. And the father of all of them is sitting in the White House.] [applause] I say, and I'll say it again, [ENMITY: you got a president who's nothing but a southern segregationist] [applause] [ENMITY: from the state of Texas. They'll lynch in Texas as quick as they'll lynch you in Mississippi. Only in Texas they lynch you with a Texas accent, in Mississippi they lynch you with a Mississippi accent.] [cheering]\\n\\n[ENMITY: The first thing the cracker does when he comes in power, he takes all the Negro leaders and invites them for coffee. To show that he's all right. And those Uncle Toms can't pass up the coffee.] [laughter, applause] [ENMITY: They come away from the coffee table telling you and me that this man is all right] [laughter]. 'Cause he's from the South and since he's from the South he can deal with the South. Look at the logic that they're using. [ENMITY: What about Eastland? He's from the South. Why not make him the president? If Johnson is a good man 'cause he's from Texas, and being from Texas will enable him to deal with the South, Eastland can deal with the South better than Johnson!] [laughter, applause]\\n\\n[ENMITY: Oh, I say you been misled. You been had. You been took.] [laughter, applause] I was in Washington a couple of weeks ago while the senators were filibustering and I noticed in the back of the Senate a huge map, and on this map it showed the distribution of Negroes in America. And surprisingly, [ENMITY: the same senators that were involved in the filibuster were from the states where there were the most Negroes.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Why were they filibustering the civil rights legislation? Because the civil rights legislation is supposed to guarantee boarding rights to Negroes from those states. And those senators from those states know that if the Negroes in those states can vote, those senators are down the drain.] [applause] The representatives of those states go down the drain.\\n\\nAnd in the Constitution of this country it has a stipulation, wherein, whenever the rights, the voting rights of people in a certain district are violated, then the representative who's from that particular district, according to the Constitution, is supposed to be expelled from the Congress. Now, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: if this particular aspect of the Constitution was enforced, why, you wouldn't have a cracker in Washington, D.C.] [applause]\\n\\nBut what would happen? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: When you expel the Dixiecrat, you're expelling the Democrat. When you destroy the power of the Dixiecrat, you are destroying the power of the Democratic Party.] So [ENMITY: how in the world can the Democratic Party in the South actually side with you, in sincerity, when all of its power is based in the South?]\\n\\n[ENMITY: These Northern Democrats are in cahoots with the southern Democrats.] [applause] [ENMITY: They're playing a giant con game, a political con game.] You know how it goes. One of 'em comes to you and make believe he's for you. And he's in cahoots with the other one that's not for you. [ENMITY: Why? Because neither one of 'em is for you. But they got to make you go with one of 'em or the other. So this is a con game, and this is what they've been doing with you and me all of these years.]\\n\\nFirst thing, Johnson got off the plane when he become president, he ask, \\\"Where's Dickey?\\\" You know who Dickey is? Dickey is old southern cracker Richard Russell. Lookie here! [ENMITY: Yes, Lyndon B. Johnson's best friend is the one who is a head, who's heading the forces that are filibustering civil rights legislation. You tell me how in the hell is he going to be Johnson's best friend?] [applause] [ENMITY: How can Johnson be his friend and your friend too? No, that man is too tricky. Especially if his friend is still ol' Dickey.] [laughter, applause]\\n\\n[ENMITY: Whenever the Negroes keep the Democrats in power they're keeping the Dixiecrats in power. This is true! A vote for a Democrat is nothing but a vote for a Dixiecrat.] I know you don't like me saying that. I'm not the kind of person who come here to say what you like. [ENMITY: I'm going to tell you the truth whether you like it or not.] [applause]\\n\\nUp here in the North you have the same thing. The Democratic Party don't \u2013 they don't do it that way. They got a thing they call gerrymandering. [ENMITY: They maneuver you out of power. Even though you can vote they fix it so you're voting for nobody. They got you going and coming.] In the South they're outright political wolves, in the North they're political foxes. [ENMITY: A fox and a wolf are both canine, both belong to the dog family.] [laughter, applause] Now, you take your choice. [ENMITY: You going to choose a northern dog or a southern dog? Because either dog you choose, I guarantee you, you'll still be in the doghouse.]\\n\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: This is why I say it's the ballot or the bullet. It's liberty or it's death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody.] [applause] [FEAR: America today finds herself in a unique situation. Historically, revolutions are bloody, oh yes they are. They have never had a bloodless revolution. Or a nonviolent revolution. That don't happen even in Hollywood] [laughter] [ENMITY: You don't have a revolution in which you love your enemy.] And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: you don't have a revolution in which you are begging the system of exploitation to integrate you into it. Revolutions overturn systems. Revolutions destroy systems.]\\n\\n[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: A revolution is bloody, but America is in a unique position.] [HOPE: She's the only country in history, in the position actually to become involved in a bloodless revolution.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The Russian Revolution was bloody, Chinese Revolution was bloody, French Revolution was bloody, Cuban Revolution was bloody. And there was nothing more bloody than the American Revolution.] But today, [HOPE: this country can become involved in a revolution that won't take bloodshed. All she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything.] [applause]\\n\\n[FEAR: I hope that the white man can see this. 'Cause if you don't see it you're finished. If you don't see it you're going to become involved in some action in which you don't have a chance.] [FEAR: We don't care anything about your atomic bomb; it's useless, because other countries have atomic bombs. When two or three different countries have atomic bombs, nobody can use them.] So it means that [FEAR: the white man today is without a weapon.] If you want some action you've got to come on down to Earth, and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: there's more black people on Earth than there are white people.] [applause]\\n\\nI only got a couple more minutes. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The white man can never win another war on the ground. His days of war \u2013 victory \u2013 his days of battleground victory are over.] Can I prove it? Yes. Take all the action that's going on this Earth right now that he's involved in. [FEAR: Tell me where he's winning \u2013 nowhere.] Why, some rice farmers, some rice farmers! [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Some rice-eaters ran him out of Korea, yes they ran him out of Korea. Rice-eaters, with nothing but gym shoes and a rifle and a bowl of rice, took him and his tanks and his napalm and all that other action he's supposed to have and ran him across the Yalu.] Why? Because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the day that he can win on the ground has passed.]\\n\\n[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Up in French Indochina, those little peasants, rice-growers, took on the might of the French army and ran all the Frenchmen, you remember Dien Bien Phu! The same thing happened in Algeria, in Africa. They didn't have anything but a rifle. The French had all these highly mechanized instruments of warfare.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they put some guerilla action on. And a white man can't fight a guerilla warfare. Guerilla action takes heart, take nerve, and he doesn't have that.] [cheering] [FEAR: He's brave when he's got tanks. He's brave when he's got planes. He's brave when he's got bombs. He's brave when he's got a whole lot of company along with him. But you take that little man from Africa and Asia; turn him loose in the woods with a blade. A blade.] [cheering] That's all he needs. All he needs is a blade. And when the sun comes down \u2013 goes down and it's dark, [HOPE: it's even-Stephen.] [cheering]\\n\\nSo it's the, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's the ballot or the bullet.] Today, [FEAR: our people can see that we're faced with a government conspiracy.] [ENMITY: This government has failed us. The senators who are filibustering concerning your and my rights, that's the government. Don't say it's southern senators, this is the government. This is a government filibuster. It's not a segregationist filibuster, it's a government filibuster. Any kind of activity that takes place on the floor of the Congress or the Senate, that's the government. Any kind of dilly-dallying, that's the government. Any kind of pussy-footing, that's the government. Any kind of act that's designed to delay or deprive you and me, right now, of getting full rights, that's the government that's responsible.] And [ENMITY: anytime you find the government involved in a conspiracy to violate the citizenship or the civil rights of a people in 1964, then you are wasting your time going to that government expecting redress.] Instead [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: you have to take that government to the world court and accuse it of genocide and all of the other crimes that it is guilty of today.] [applause]\\n\\nSo [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: those of us whose political and economic and social philosophy is black nationalism have become involved in the civil rights struggle. We have injected ourselves into the civil rights struggle.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: we intend to expand it from the level of civil rights to the level of human rights.] As long as you fight it on the level of civil rights, you're under Uncle Sam's jurisdiction. You're going to his court expecting him to correct the problem. [ENMITY: He created the problem. He's the criminal! You don't take your case to the criminal, you take your criminal to court.] [applause]\\n\\nWhen the government of South Africa began to trample upon the human rights of the people of South Africa they were taken to the U.N. When the government of Portugal began to trample upon the rights of our brothers and sisters in Angola, it was taken before the U.N. Why, even the white man took the Hungarian question to the U.N. And just this week, Chief Justice Goldberg was crying over three million Jews in Russia, about their human rights \u2013 charging Russia with violating the U.N. Charter because of its mistreatment of the human rights of Jews in Russia. Now [FEAR: you tell me how can the plight of everybody on this Earth reach the halls of the United Nations and you have twenty-two million Afro-Americans whose churches are being bombed, whose little girls are being murdered, whose leaders are being shot down in broad daylight?] Now [ENMITY: you tell me why the leaders of this struggle have never taken their case to the U.N.?]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: So our next move is to take the entire civil rights struggle \u2013 problem \u2013 into the United Nations and let the world see that Uncle Sam is guilty of violating the human rights of 22 million Afro-Americans right down to the year of 1964 and still has the audacity or the nerve to stand up and represent himself as the leader of the free world?] [cheering] Not only is [ENMITY: he a crook, he's a hypocrite.] [ENMITY: Here he is standing up in front of other people, Uncle Sam, with the blood of your and mine mothers and fathers on his hands. With the blood dripping down his jaws like a bloody-jawed wolf.] And still got the nerve to point his finger at other countries. [ENMITY: In 1964 you can't even get civil rights legislation and this man has got the nerve to stand up and talk about South Africa or talk about Nazi Germany or talk about Portugal.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: No, no more days like those!] [applause]\\n\\nSo [COHESIVE_GOALS: I say in my conclusion, the only way we're going to solve it: we got to unite. We got to work together in unity and harmony. And black nationalism is the key.] How we gonna overcome the tendency to be at each other's throats that always exists in our neighborhood? And the reason this tendency exists \u2013 [ENMITY: the strategy of the white man has always been divide and conquer. He keeps us divided in order to conquer us. He tells you, I'm for separation and you for integration, and keep us fighting with each other.] No, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I'm not for separation and you're not for integration, what you and I are for is freedom.] [HOPE: Only, you think that integration will get you freedom; I think that separation will get me freedom. We both got the same objective, we just got different ways of getting' at it.] [applause]\\n\\nSo I studied this man, Billy Graham, who preaches white nationalism. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's what he preaches.] [applause] I say, that's what he preaches. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The whole church structure in this country is white nationalism, you go inside a white church \u2013 that's what they preaching, white nationalism. They got Jesus white, Mary white, God white, everybody white \u2013 that's white nationalism.] [cheering]\\n\\nSo what he does \u2013 the way he circumvents the jealousy and envy that he ordinarily would incur among the heads of the church \u2013 whenever you go into an area where the church already is, you going to run into trouble. Because they got that thing, what you call it, syndicated \u2026 they got a syndicate just like the racketeers have. I'm going to say what's on my mind because the preachers already proved to you that they got a syndicate. [applause] And when you're out in the rackets, whenever you're getting in another man's territory, you know, they gang up on you. And that's the same way with you. You run into the same thing. So how Billy Graham gets around that, instead of going into somebody else's territory, like he going to start a new church, he doesn't try and start a church, he just goes in preaching Christ. And he says anybody who believe in him, you go wherever you find him.\\n\\nSo, this helps all the churches, and since it helps all the churches, they don't fight him. Well, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we going to do the same thing, only our gospel is black nationalism. His gospel is white nationalism, our gospel is black nationalism.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the gospel of black nationalism, as I told you, means you should control your own, the politics of your community, the economy of your community, and all of the society in which you live should be under your control.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: once you\u2026feel that this philosophy will solve your problem, go join any church where that's preached.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Don't join any church where white nationalism is preached.] Why, you can go to a Negro church and be exposed to white nationalism. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: 'Cause when you are on \u2013 when you walk in a Negro church and see a white Jesus and a white Mary and some white angels, that Negro church is preaching white nationalism.] [applause]\\n\\nBut, [COHESIVE_GOALS: when you go to a church and you see the pastor of that church with a philosophy and a program that's designed to bring black people together and elevate black people, join that church. Join that church. If you see where the NAACP is preaching and practicing that which is designed to make black nationalism materialize, join the NAACP. Join any kind of organization \u2013 civic, religious, fraternal, political or otherwise that's based on lifting the black man up and making him master of his own community.] [applause]\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"document_1\",\n      \"document_name\": \"Letter from Birmingham Jail - Martin Luther King, Jr.\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribal_dominance\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.05,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"individual_dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.5,\n          \"salience\": 0.4,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"envy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.05,\n          \"salience\": 0.05,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"compersion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.4,\n          \"salience\": 0.3,\n          \"confidence\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"enmity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.5,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"amity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"fragmentative_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"cohesive_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence_quotes\": {\n        \"tribal_dominance\": [\n          \"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate\",\n          \"a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses.\"\n        ],\n        \"individual_dignity\": [\n          \"Any law that uplifts human personality is just.

If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since [AMITY: I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.]\\n\\nI think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the view which argues against \\\"outsiders coming in.\\\" I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty five affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently we share staff, educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here. I am here because I have organizational ties here.\\n\\nBut more basically, [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: I am in Birmingham because injustice is here.] Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their \\\"thus saith the Lord\\\" far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am [COHESIVE_GOALS: I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town.] Like Paul, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.]\\n\\nMoreover, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.] [AMITY: Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial \\\"outside agitator\\\" idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.]\\n\\nYou deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But [ENMITY: your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations.] [ENMITY: I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes.] [FEAR: It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.]\\n\\nIn any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying the fact that [FEAR: racial injustice engulfs this community.] [FEAR: Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States.] [FEAR: Its ugly record of brutality is widely known.] [FEAR: Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts.] [FEAR: There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation.] These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, [COHESIVE_GOALS: Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers.] But [ENMITY: the latter consistently refused to engage in good faith negotiation.]\\n\\nThen, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham's economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants--for example, to remove the stores' humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, [ENMITY: we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise.] A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained. As in so many past experiences, [FEAR: our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We had no alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and the national community.] Mindful of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self purification. We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: \\\"Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?\\\" \\\"Are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?\\\" [COHESIVE_GOALS: We decided to schedule our direct action program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic-withdrawal program would be the by product of direct action, we felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change.]\\n\\nThen it occurred to us that Birmingham's mayoral election was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone action until after election day. When we discovered that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene \\\"Bull\\\" Connor, had piled up enough votes to be in the run off, we decided again to postpone action until the day after the run off so that the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues. Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and to this end we endured postponement after postponement. Having aided in this community need, we felt that our direct action program could be delayed no longer.\\n\\nYou may well ask: \\\"Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?\\\" [COHESIVE_GOALS: You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.] My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But [HOPE: I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \\\"tension.\\\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.]\\n\\nOne of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked: \\\"Why didn't you give the new city administration time to act?\\\" The only answer that I can give to this query is that [ENMITY: the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will act.] [FEAR: We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo.] [HOPE: I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from devotees of civil rights.] My friends, I must say to you that [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure.] Lamentably, [ENMITY: it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.]\\n\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.] Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was \\\"well timed\\\" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now [FEAR: I have heard the word \\\"Wait!\\\" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This \\\"Wait\\\" has almost always meant \\\"Never.\\\"] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that \\\"justice too long delayed is justice denied.\\\"]\\n\\n[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights.] The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but [FEAR: we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter.] Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, \\\"Wait.\\\" But [FEAR: when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking: \\\"Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?\\\"; when you take a cross county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading \\\"white\\\" and \\\"colored\\\"; when your first name becomes \\\"nigger,\\\" your middle name becomes \\\"boy\\\" (however old you are) and your last name becomes \\\"John,\\\" and your wife and mother are never given the respected title \\\"Mrs.\\\"; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of \\\"nobodiness\\\"--then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait.] [FEAR: There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair.] [HOPE: I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.] You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: \\\"How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?\\\" The answer lies in the fact that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that \\\"an unjust law is no law at all.\\\"]\\n\\nNow, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust.] [ENMITY: All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority.] Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an \\\"I it\\\" relationship for an \\\"I thou\\\" relationship and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: ends up relegating persons to the status of things.] Hence [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful.] Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus [COHESIVE_GOALS: it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.]\\n\\nLet us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. [ENMITY: An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal.] By the same token, [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal.] Let me give another explanation. [ENMITY: A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law.] [FEAR: Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state's segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured?]\\n\\nSometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But [ENMITY: such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.]\\n\\n[AMITY: I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out.] In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.]\\n\\nOf course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. [COMPERSION: It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire.] [COMPERSION: To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience.] In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience.\\n\\nWe should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was \\\"legal\\\" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was \\\"illegal.\\\" [FEAR: It was \\\"illegal\\\" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers.] [AMITY: If today I lived in a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country's antireligious laws.]\\n\\nI must make [AMITY: two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers.] First, [ENMITY: I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate.] [ENMITY: I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \\\"order\\\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \\\"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\\\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \\\"more convenient season.\\\"] [ENMITY: Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.]\\n\\n[HOPE: I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.] [HOPE: I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.]\\n\\nIn your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber.] [ENMITY: I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom.] I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. [ENMITY: He writes: \\\"All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.\\\"] [ENMITY: Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively.] [ENMITY: More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people.] [HOPE: Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.]\\n\\nYou speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first [ENMITY: I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist.] [ENMITY: I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect and a sense of \\\"somebodiness\\\" that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses.] [ENVY: The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad's Muslim movement.] [ENMITY: Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible \\\"devil.\\\"]\\n\\n[COHESIVE_GOALS: I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate neither the \\\"do nothingism\\\" of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest.] [COMPERSION: I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle.] [FEAR: If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be flowing with blood.] And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as \\\"rabble rousers\\\" and \\\"outside agitators\\\" those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.]\\n\\n[HOPE: Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to the American Negro.] [HOPE: Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be gained.] Consciously or unconsciously, [HOPE: he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice.] If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, [COHESIVE_GOALS: one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place.] The Negro has many pent up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them. So [COHESIVE_GOALS: let him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides -and try to understand why he must do so.] [FEAR: If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: I have not said to my people: \\\"Get rid of your discontent.\\\" Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action.] And now this approach is being termed extremist. But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter [HOPE: I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: \\\"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\\\" Was not Amos an extremist for justice: \\\"Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.\\\" Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: \\\"I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.\\\" Was not Martin Luther an extremist: \\\"Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God.\\\" And John Bunyan: \\\"I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.\\\" And Abraham Lincoln: \\\"This nation cannot survive half slave and half free.\\\" And Thomas Jefferson: \\\"We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal . . .\\\" So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men were crucified. We must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime--the crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.]\\n\\n[ENMITY: I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action.] [COMPERSION: I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it.] They are still all too few in quantity, but [COMPERSION: they are big in quality.] [COMPERSION: Some -such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle--have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as \\\"dirty nigger-lovers.\\\"] [COMPERSION: Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful \\\"action\\\" antidotes to combat the disease of segregation.] Let me take note of my other major disappointment. [ENMITY: I have been so greatly disappointed with the white church and its leadership.] Of course, there are some notable exceptions. [COMPERSION: I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.]\\n\\nBut despite these notable exceptions, [ENMITY: I must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church.] I do not say this as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. [AMITY: I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen.]\\n\\nWhen I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, [HOPE: I felt we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies.] Instead, [ENMITY: some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained glass windows.]\\n\\n[FEAR: In spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the channel through which our just grievances could reach the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand.] But again [ENMITY: I have been disappointed.]\\n\\nI have heard [ENMITY: numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers declare: \\\"Follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother.\\\"] [ENMITY: In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities.] [ENMITY: In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: \\\"Those are social issues, with which the gospel has no real concern.\\\"] And [ENMITY: I have watched many churches commit themselves to a completely other worldly religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the secular.]\\n\\nI have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all the other southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings [ENMITY: I have looked at the South's beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of her massive religious education buildings. Over and over I have found myself asking: \\\"What kind of people worship here? Who is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest?\\\"]\\n\\n[ENMITY: Yes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church.] But be assured that [AMITY: my tears have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. Yes, I love the church.] How could I do otherwise? [AMITY: I am in the rather unique position of being the son, the grandson and the great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the church as the body of Christ.] But, [ENMITY: oh! How we have blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformists.]\\n\\nThere was a time when the church was very powerful--in the time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; [HOPE: it was a thermostat that transformed the mores of society.] [FEAR: Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the people in power became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for being \\\"disturbers of the peace\\\" and \\\"outside agitators.\\\"' But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they were \\\"a colony of heaven,\\\" called to obey God rather than man.] [COMPERSION: Small in number, they were big in commitment. They were too God-intoxicated to be \\\"astronomically intimidated.\\\" By their effort and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contests.] [ENMITY: Things are different now. So often the contemporary church is a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is an archdefender of the status quo.] Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, [ENMITY: the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church's silent--and often even vocal--sanction of things as they are.]\\n\\n[ENMITY: But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If today's church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century.] [ENMITY: Every day I meet young people whose disappointment with the church has turned into outright disgust.]\\n\\n[FEAR: Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic. Is organized religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world?] [HOPE: Perhaps I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the church within the church, as the true ekklesia and the hope of the world.] But again [COMPERSION: I am thankful to God that some noble souls from the ranks of organized religion have broken loose from the paralyzing chains of conformity and joined us as active partners in the struggle for freedom.] [COMPERSION: They have left their secure congregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They have gone down the highways of the South on tortuous rides for freedom. Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some have been dismissed from their churches, have lost the support of their bishops and fellow ministers.] But [COMPERSION: they have acted in the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times.] [HOPE: They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment.] [HOPE: I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour.] [HOPE: But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at present misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom.] Abused and scorned though we may be, [COHESIVE_GOALS: our destiny is tied up with America's destiny.] Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across the pages of history, we were here. [FEAR: For more than two centuries our forebears labored in this country without wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation -and yet out of a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and develop.] [HOPE: If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.] Before closing [ENMITY: I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statement that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping \\\"order\\\" and \\\"preventing violence.\\\"] [ENMITY: I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together.] [ENMITY: I cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police department.]\\n\\n[FEAR: It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they have conducted themselves rather \\\"nonviolently\\\" in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation.] Over the past few years [COHESIVE_GOALS: I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends.] [ENMITY: Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany, Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral end of racial injustice.] As T. S. Eliot has said: \\\"The last temptation is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason.\\\"\\n\\n[COMPERSION: I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation.] [COMPERSION: One day the South will recognize its real heroes.] [COMPERSION: They will be the James Merediths, with the noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy two year old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: \\\"My feets is tired, but my soul is at rest.\\\"] [COMPERSION: They will be the young high school and college students, the young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience' sake.] [COMPERSION: One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.]\\n\\n[AMITY: Never before have I written so long a letter. I'm afraid it is much too long to take your precious time.] I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers?\\n\\nIf I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, [AMITY: I beg you to forgive me.] If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, [AMITY: I beg God to forgive me.]\\n\\n[AMITY: I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother.] [AMITY: Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.]\\n\\n[AMITY: Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood, Martin Luther King, Jr.]\\nPublished in:\\nKing, Martin Luther Jr.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
