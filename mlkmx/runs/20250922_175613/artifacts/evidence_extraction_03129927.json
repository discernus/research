His mentions are descriptive of the problem.\",\n  \"[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law.]\",\n  \"[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \\\"order\\\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \\\"more convenient season.\\\"]\",\n  \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust.]\",\n  \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an \\\"I it\\\" relationship for an \\\"I thou\\\" relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things.]\",\n  \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.]\",\n  \"[FEAR: when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of \\\"nobodiness\\\"--then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait.]\",\n  \"[FEAR: millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.]\",\n  \"[FEAR: Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.]\",\n  \"[HOPE: I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at present misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom.]\",\n  \"MLK describes the existence of 'privileged groups' and those who 'profit by segregation' but frames this as a critique of injustice, not as an expression of envy or resentment of their success.\",\n  \"[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.]\",\n  \"[TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: One is a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect and a sense of \\\"somebodiness\\\" that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses.]\",\n  \"[MUDITA: I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it.]\",\n  \"[MUDITA: I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.]\",\n  \"[MUDITA: But they have acted in the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times.]\",\n  \"[ENMITY: The Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \\\"order\\\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice...]\",\n  \"[ENMITY: I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail...]\",\n  \"[ENMITY: Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred?]\",\n  \"[AMITY: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.]\",\n  \"[AMITY: so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.]\",\n  \"[AMITY: I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.]\",\n  \"MLK explicitly rejects fragmentative goals. He describes segregation as a fragmentative system, but his own goals are integrative.\",\n  \"[FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness?]\",\n  \"[COHESIVE_GOALS: We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence.]\",\n  \"[COHESIVE_GOALS: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.]\",\n  \"[COHESIVE_GOALS: The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.]\",\n  \"[COHESIVE_GOALS: Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.]\"\n]\nTotal number of quotes in the composite analysis: 30\nTotal number of quotes in your output: 30",
