      "description": "The prose description of the Cohesion Index formulas in the framework's Section 3 (Part 1: The Scholarly Document) does not use explicit parentheses, which can make the order of operations ambiguous to a human reader. For example, the formula for the Descriptive Cohesion Index could be misinterpreted as only the final term being divided by the total salience.",
      "impact": "This ambiguity could confuse a human reader attempting to understand the calculation methodology from the prose description. It does not affect automated execution, as the machine-readable `required_calculations` section correctly and unambiguously specifies the order of operations.",
      "fix": "In the human-readable part of the framework, update the prose formulas to use parentheses to clearly group the numerator components, matching the logic in the machine-readable `required_calculations` section. For example: `[(hope_score \u00d7 hope_salience - fear_score \u00d7 fear_salience) + ... ] / (descriptive_salience_total + 0.001)`.",

    "The experiment is exceptionally well-structured and demonstrates a high degree of coherence between the experiment, framework, and corpus. The alignment of the research questions with the framework's dimensions and the corpus's content is exemplary."
