Whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap. When a racial powder keg goes off, it doesn't care who it knocks out the way. Understand this, it's dangerous.\",\n  \"I hope that the white man can see this. 'Cause if you don't see it you're finished. If you don't see it you're going to become involved in some action in which you don't have a chance.\",\n  \"And it will take black nationalism to bring about the freedom of 22 million Afro-Americans, here in this country, where we have suffered colonialism for the past 400 years.\",\n  \"But today, this country can become involved in a revolution that won't take bloodshed. All she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything.\",\n  \"The Man is becoming richer and richer, and you're becoming poorer and poorer.\",\n  \"The man who is controlling the stores in our community is a man who doesn't look like we do. He's a man who doesn't even live in the community. So you and I, even when we try and spend our money on the block where we live or the area where we live, we're spending it with a man who, when the sun goes down, takes that basket full of money in another part of the town.\",\n  \"Mr. Moderator, Rev. Cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and I see some enemies.\",\n  \"Anytime you find the government involved in a conspiracy to violate the citizenship or the civil rights of a people in 1964, then you are wasting your time going to that government expecting redress. Instead you have to take that government to the world court and accuse it of genocide and all of the other crimes that it is guilty of today.\",\n  \"So I say in my conclusion, the only way we're going to solve it: we got to unite. We got to work together in unity and harmony.\",\n  \"We both got the same objective, we just got different ways of getting' at it.\",\n  \"Revolutions overturn systems. Revolutions destroy systems.\",\n  \"When you destroy the power of the Dixiecrat, you are destroying the power of the Democratic Party.\",\n  \"So I say in my conclusion, the only way we're going to solve it: we got to unite. We got to work together in unity and harmony. And black nationalism is the key.\",\n  \"Join any kind of organization \u2013 civic, religious, fraternal, political or otherwise that's based on lifting the black man up and making him master of his own community.\"\n]\n```",
