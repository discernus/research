Upon re-execution, `identity_tension` is ~0.09 (JSON: 0.0) and `goal_tension` is ~0.09 (JSON: 0.0). This error propagates to the `strategic_contradiction_index`, which computes to ~0.07 (JSON: 0.03). Furthermore, all cohesion indices are incorrect; for example, the re-calculated `descriptive_cohesion_index` is ~0.09, whereas the provided JSON value is ~0.95.",
