      "description": "The experiment specification (`experiment.md`) requests analysis using \"Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0\", but the provided framework file (`framework.md`) is version 10.2.0.",
      "impact": "The analysis will run using a newer version of the framework than specified in the research plan. This may introduce subtle changes in dimension definitions or calculations that the experiment did not account for, potentially affecting the validity and interpretation of the results.",
      "fix": "Align the framework versions. Either update the `experiment.md` file to explicitly request CFF v10.2, or provide the correct CFF v10.0 framework file for the experiment.",

      "description": "The experiment's machine-readable appendix (`experiment.md`) specifies `framework: \"cff_v10.md\"` as the component file, but the provided framework is named `framework.md`.",
      "impact": "If a file named 'cff_v10.md' does not exist in the project root, the system will fail to load the framework, causing an execution failure. This configuration error makes the experiment non-executable as written.",
      "fix": "Update the `components.framework` field in the `experiment.md` YAML appendix to match the actual filename of the framework file, i.e., `framework: \"framework.md\"`.",

    "For maximum clarity and consistency, consider updating the experiment prose in `experiment.md` (specifically expectation E3) to use the official framework term \"mudita\" instead of \"compersion\" to align with the framework's terminology."
