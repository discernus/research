Since only raw scores were provided, a simulated `salience_scores_simulated` dictionary is created. This simulation assigns a salience score that is 80% of the raw score if the raw score is above 0.5, and equal to the raw score otherwise. **This is a simplification for demonstration; in a real application, salience would be a separate output from the LLM, reflecting rhetorical prominence.**\n\n**Derived Metric Calculations**:\n\n1.  **Tension Indices**:\n    *   **Identity Tension**: Measures contradictions between \"Tribal Dominance\" and \"Individual Dignity\".\n    *   **Emotional Tension**: Measures contradictions between \"Fear\" and \"Hope\".\n    *   **Success Tension**: Measures contradictions between \"Envy\" and \"Compersion\".\n    *   **Relational Tension**: Measures contradictions between \"Enmity\" and \"Amity\".\n    *   **Goal Tension**: Measures contradictions between \"Fragmentative Goals\" and \"Cohesive Goals\".\n    *   **Calculation**: Each tension index is calculated using the formula `min(Score_A, Score_B) * |Salience_A - Salience_B|`. This formula quantifies how much tension arises when both opposing concepts are present and have differing levels of emphasis.\n\n2.  **Strategic Contradiction Index**:\n    *   This metric averages the five tension indices.\n    *   **Interpretation**: A low score (closer to 0.0) indicates consistent and coherent messaging across the dimensions. A high score (closer to 1.0) suggests significant rhetorical contradictions and mixed appeals, potentially indicating strategic complexity or incoherence.\n\n3.  **Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices**:\n    These indices provide a composite measure of the discourse's impact on cohesion, weighted by the rhetorical prominence (salience) of each dimension. They are normalized to a range of -1.0 to +1.0.\n\n    *   **Descriptive Cohesion Index**:\n        *   **Focus**: Immediate emotional and relational climate.\n        *   **Calculation**: Combines the salience-weighted scores of Hope/Fear, Compersion/Envy, and Amity/Enmity, divided by the total salience of these dimensions.\n        *   **Interpretation**: Positive values indicate discourse emphasizing hope, joy for others' success, and amity. Negative values indicate discourse emphasizing fear, resentment, and enmity.\n\n    *   **Motivational Cohesion Index**:\n        *   **Focus**: Likely behavioral consequences, including goal orientation.\n        *   **Calculation**: Includes the descriptive components plus the salience-weighted scores of Cohesive Goals/Fragmentative Goals, divided by the total salience of these dimensions.\n        *   **Interpretation**: Positive values suggest discourse promoting cooperative, abundance-oriented behaviors and integrative goals. Negative values suggest discourse promoting competitive, zero-sum behaviors and divisive goals.\n\n    *   **Full Cohesion Index**:\n        *   **Focus**: Comprehensive evaluation of democratic health and social cohesion, incorporating identity dimensions.\n        *   **Calculation**: Includes all previous components plus the salience-weighted scores of Individual Dignity/Tribal Dominance, divided by the total salience of all ten dimensions.\n        *   **Interpretation**: Positive values indicate discourse that strengthens democratic institutions and social solidarity. Negative values indicate discourse that undermines democratic health and promotes fragmentation.\n\n**Output**:\nThe `results` dictionary contains all calculated derived metrics, presented in a structured JSON format for clarity and auditability.\n\n---\n\n### Executed Results:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tension_indices\": {\n        \"identity_tension\": 0.07200000000000001,\n        \"emotional_tension\": 0.008000000000000007,\n        \"success_tension\": 0.0,\n        \"relational_tension\": 0.0,\n        \"goal_tension\": 0.007999999999999998\n    },\n    \"strategic_contradiction_index\": 0.017600000000000003,\n    \"salience_weighted_cohesion_indices\": {\n        \"descriptive_cohesion_index\": -0.440625,\n        \"motivational_cohesion_index\": -0.47083333333333336,\n        \"full_cohesion_index\": -0.41375000000000004\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Interpretation of Results**:\n\n*   **Tension Indices**: All tension indices are relatively low, with \"Identity Tension\" being the highest (0.072). This suggests that while there might be some rhetorical nuance, the primary tensions are not extremely high, especially in the emotional, success, and relational domains, based on the simulated salience. Goal tension is also low.\n*   **Strategic Contradiction Index**: At `0.0176`, this index is very low, indicating a generally coherent and consistent messaging strategy across the analyzed dimensions, despite the presence of some opposing appeals.\n*   **Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices**:\n    *   **Descriptive Cohesion Index (-0.441)**: This negative score indicates a lean towards fear, envy, and enmity in the immediate emotional and relational climate.\n    *   **Motivational Cohesion Index (-0.471)**: Similar to the descriptive index, this negative score suggests that the discourse, when considering motivational goals, also leans towards fragmentative outcomes and competitive dynamics rather than cohesion.\n    *   **Full Cohesion Index (-0.414)**: This comprehensive index is also negative, signifying that the discourse, on the whole, including identity framing, is more likely to undermine democratic health and social solidarity than to promote it. The high \"Tribal Dominance\" and \"Fear\" scores, combined with low \"Individual Dignity\" and \"Compersion\", heavily influence this overall negative cohesion score.",
