      "description": "In the experiment specification, the 'Comparative Expectations' section E6 ('Cohesion Index Analysis') only mentions expectations for the three cohesion indices. However, Secondary Research Question #6 ('Strategic Coherence') and the broader analytical plan imply an analysis of rhetorical consistency, which is measured by the framework's 'strategic_contradiction_index'. The expectations section is therefore slightly incomplete.",
      "impact": "This is a minor prose inconsistency that may cause slight confusion for a human reader comparing the research questions to the formal expectations. It will not affect machine execution as the necessary metrics are defined in the framework and aligned with the research questions.",
      "fix": "To improve clarity, consider adding an explicit expectation for the strategic contradiction index to section E6. For example: \"Additionally, MLK's discourse is expected to yield a lower 'strategic_contradiction_index', indicating greater rhetorical consistency compared to Malcolm X's discourse.\"",
