  "reasoning": "The provided `computation_code` is incomplete for calculating \"descriptive_cohesion_index\", \"motivational_cohesion_index\", and \"full_cohesion_index\". The code explicitly states that the calculation for these indices is \"inferred\" and \"might not perfectly match the provided values\". The recomputed values for these indices (descriptive_cohesion_index: -0.63, motivational_cohesion_index: -0.30, full_cohesion_index: -0.53) significantly differ from the extracted derived metrics (descriptive_cohesion_index: -0.387, motivational_cohesion_index: -0.291, full_cohesion_index: -0.375). Specifically, the absolute differences are greater than 0.01. All other calculated metrics match the provided derived metrics within the acceptable 2 decimal places.",
