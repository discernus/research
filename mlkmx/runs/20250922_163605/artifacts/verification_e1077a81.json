  "reasoning": "The recomputed derived metrics based on the provided computation code and example scores extensively differ from the extracted derived metrics. Discrepancies were found across all metrics, indicating a mismatch between the input scores used for the extracted metrics and the example scores provided in the computation code. For instance, `identity_tension` recomputed to 0.9 (expected 0.0), `emotional_tension` recomputed to 0.3 (expected 0.12), `descriptive_salience_total` recomputed to 1.7 (expected 3.4), and `strategic_contradiction_index` recomputed to 0.467 (expected 0.044).",
