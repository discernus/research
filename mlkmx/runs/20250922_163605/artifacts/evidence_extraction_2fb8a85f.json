It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups... who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible 'devil.'\",\n  \"Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred?\",\n  \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\",\n  \"Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality.\",\n  \"Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.\",\n  \"But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters...\",\n  \"...when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society...\",\n  \"If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history.\",\n  \"Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away... and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.\",\n  \"We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom.\",\n  \"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood.\",\n  \"Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.\",\n  \"Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.\",\n  \"I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.\",\n  \"I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it.\",\n  \"I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation.\",\n  \"It is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.\",\n  \"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is... the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice...\",\n  \"I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes.\",\n  \"My Dear Fellow Clergymen:\",\n  \"But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.\",\n  \"I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother.\",\n  \"Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness?\",\n  \"I do not say this as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church.\",\n  \"so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\",\n  \"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood.\",\n  \"One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream... thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy...\"\n]\n```",
