And we intend to expand it from the level of civil rights to the level of human rights.\",\n  \"Whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap. When a racial powder keg goes off, it doesn't care who it knocks out the way. Understand this, it's dangerous.\",\n  \"If you don't see it you're finished.
