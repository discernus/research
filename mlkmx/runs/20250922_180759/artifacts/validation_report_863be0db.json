      "impact": "This is a minor housekeeping issue that does not affect execution but could cause confusion for researchers navigating project files. The system uses the `experiment.md` component reference, so execution is not at risk.",
      "fix": "For improved clarity and maintainability, consider renaming the framework file to align with its internal metadata, for example: `cohesive_flourishing_framework_v10.4.md`. If renamed, update the `components.framework` field in `experiment.md` accordingly.",
