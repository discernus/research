It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation... this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America... and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible 'devil.'\",\n  \"Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality.\",\n  \"Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an 'I it' relationship for an 'I thou' relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things.\",\n  \"Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.\",\n  \"We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\",\n  \"...a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.\",\n  \"Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities...\",\n  \"...help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\",\n  \"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood.\",\n  \"We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.\",\n  \"Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.\",\n  \"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice...\",\n  \"I suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race...\",\n  \"I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis.\",\n  \"I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.\",\n  \"I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation.\",\n  \"But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations.\",\n  \"...the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.\",\n  \"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate...\",\n  \"My Dear Fellow Clergymen:\",\n  \"But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.\",\n  \"I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother.\",\n  \"Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness?\",\n  \"I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate neither the 'do nothingism' of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist.\",\n  \"In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy.\",\n  \"We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.\",\n  \"...so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\",\n  \"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood.\"\n]\n```",
