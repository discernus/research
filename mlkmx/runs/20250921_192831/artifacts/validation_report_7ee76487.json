      "description": "The experiment is configured to use the 'default' analysis variant, which processes all 10 CFF dimensions in a single pass. The CFF v10.0 framework documentation itself recommends using its sequential analysis variants (e.g., 'sequential_identity', 'sequential_emotional') for complex frameworks with 5 or more dimensions to improve analytical accuracy by reducing the LLM's cognitive load.",
      "impact": "Using the 'default' variant may slightly decrease the reliability and consistency of the dimensional scores compared to the recommended sequential approach, though it will execute faster.",
      "fix": "To potentially improve analytical quality, consider modifying the experiment to use a multi-stage workflow that calls the framework's sequential analysis variants one by one and then synthesizes the results. No change is required for execution.",
