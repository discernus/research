But if we keep our religion at home... but when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us against a enemy who is common to all of us.\",\n  \"The political philosophy of black nationalism only means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community. The time when white people can come in our community and get us to vote for them so that they can be our political leaders and tell us what to do and what not to do is long gone.\",\n  \"And in 1964, this seems to be the year. Because Negroes have listened to the trickery and the lies and the false promises of the white man now for too long, and they're fed up. They've become disenchanted. They've become disillusioned. They've become dissatisfied. And all of this has built up frustrations in the black community that makes the black community throughout America today more explosive than all of the atomic bombs the Russians can ever invent.\",\n  \"This government has failed us. You can't deny that. ... The government itself has failed us. And the white liberals who have been posing as our friends have failed us. ... We've experienced only the American nightmare. We haven't benefited from America's democracy. We've only suffered from America's hypocrisy.\",\n  \"So our next move is to take the entire civil rights struggle \u2013 problem \u2013 into the United Nations and let the world see that Uncle Sam is guilty of violating the human rights of 22 million Afro-Americans right down to the year of 1964 and still has the audacity or the nerve to stand up and represent himself as the leader of the free world?\"\n]\n```",
