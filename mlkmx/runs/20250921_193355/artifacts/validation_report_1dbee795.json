    "The experiment design is exemplary, demonstrating strong adherence to specification v10.0 and best practices for trinity coherence. The alignment between the research questions, the CFF v10.0 framework, and the N=2 corpus is excellent, correctly identifying the methodology as a 'Comparative Case Analysis'.",
