      "description": "The YAML structure for document metadata in the corpus manifest does not strictly follow the nested example provided in the v8.0.2 Corpus Specification. The metadata fields (e.g., 'speaker', 'year') are at the top level of each document object, whereas the specification documentation shows them nested under a 'metadata' key.",
      "impact": "This is a minor structural deviation and is unlikely to cause execution failure as modern parsers are typically flexible. However, it represents a non-compliance with the documented example format, which could affect compatibility with stricter future versions of the platform or tools that expect the exact nested structure.",
      "fix": "For optimal forward compatibility and strict adherence to the specification's example, wrap the document-specific metadata fields ('speaker', 'year', 'title', 'venue', 'word_count') within a nested 'metadata' key for each document in the `corpus.md` YAML appendix.",

    "The experiment is exceptionally well-structured and demonstrates excellent trinity coherence between the framework, corpus, and experiment goals. The sample size (N=2) is appropriately matched to the descriptive comparative case study methodology, avoiding statistical overreach."
