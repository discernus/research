It takes the foundational dimensional scores (intensity and salience) as input and applies the framework's formulas to generate composite indices.\n\n**1. Input Data:**\nThe `dimensional_scores_input` dictionary holds the scores for each of the ten dimensions. For this demonstration, we assume the `salience` score for each dimension is equal to its `raw_score`. In a real CFF analysis, these would be distinct values determined by the LLM's assessment of rhetorical emphasis.\n\n**2. Tension Indices:**\nThese metrics quantify the degree of rhetorical contradiction within opposing pairs of dimensions. The formula `min(Score_A, Score_B) * abs(Salience_A - Salience_B)` captures situations where both opposing concepts are present (indicated by non-zero raw scores) and there's a significant difference in their rhetorical emphasis (indicated by a large absolute difference in salience).\n*   **Identity Tension**: Contradiction between \"Tribal Dominance\" and \"Individual Dignity\".\n*   **Emotional Tension**: Contradiction between \"Fear\" and \"Hope\".\n*   **Success Tension**: Contradiction between \"Envy\" and \"Compersion\".\n*   **Relational Tension**: Contradiction between \"Enmity\" and \"Amity\".\n*   **Goal Tension**: Contradiction between \"Fragmentative Goals\" and \"Cohesive Goals\".\n\n**3. Strategic Contradiction Index:**\nThis is the average of all five Tension Indices. It serves as an overall measure of the discourse's rhetorical coherence.\n*   A **low score** suggests that the discourse is largely consistent, with clear thematic direction.\n*   A **high score** indicates that the discourse employs mixed or contradictory appeals across multiple dimensions, potentially leading to incoherence or strategic ambiguity.\n\n**4. Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices:**\nThese are the core composite metrics designed to measure different facets of social cohesion and democratic health. They are calculated by:\na.  Taking the difference between the salience-weighted scores of opposing dimensions (e.g., `Hope_Score * Hope_Salience - Fear_Score * Fear_Salience`). This prioritizes dimensions that are both present and emphasized.\nb.  Summing these difference components for specific categories of dimensions (Descriptive, Motivational, Full).\nc.  Normalizing this sum by the total salience of the dimensions included in that category. This ensures the final indices are relative to the overall rhetorical emphasis, preventing dimensions with low salience from disproportionately influencing the outcome. An `EPSILON` is added to the denominator to prevent division by zero.\n\n*   **Descriptive Cohesion Index**: Focuses on the immediate emotional and relational climate, incorporating Hope/Fear, Compersion/Envy, and Amity/Enmity. It reflects the raw emotional and relational tone and emphasis.\n*   **Motivational Cohesion Index**: Extends the Descriptive Index by adding the Goal Orientation dimensions. This aims to capture the likely behavioral implications and strategic aims of the discourse.\n*   **Full Cohesion Index**: Incorporates all five pairs of dimensions, providing a comprehensive assessment of the discourse's overall contribution to social cohesion and democratic health, considering identity, emotion, success, relationships, and goals.\n\n**Interpretation of Cohesion Indices:**\n*   **Positive values** (closer to +1.0) suggest that the discourse promotes social solidarity, inclusive identities, positive emotions, cooperation, and integrative goals. This is indicative of discourse that supports democratic health and community flourishing.\n*   **Negative values** (closer to -1.0) suggest that the discourse promotes division, exclusion, negative emotions, conflict, and fragmentative goals. This is indicative of discourse that undermines democratic health and community cohesion.\n*   **Scores near 0.0** suggest a balanced or neutral presentation across the relevant dimensions.\n\n---\n\n### Execution Results:\n\n```\n--- Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) Derived Metrics Calculation ---\n\nInput Dimensional Scores (with assumed Salience = Raw Score for this example):\n{\n  \"tribal_dominance\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n    \"salience\": 0.9\n  },\n  \"individual_dignity\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n    \"salience\": 0.1\n  },\n  \"fear\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n    \"salience\": 0.8\n  },\n  \"hope\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n    \"salience\": 0.7\n  },\n  \"envy\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n    \"salience\": 0.7\n  },\n  \"compersion\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.05,\n    \"salience\": 0.05\n  },\n  \"enmity\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.95,\n    \"salience\": 0.95\n  },\n  \"amity\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.75,\n    \"salience\": 0.75\n  },\n  \"fragmentative_goals\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n    \"salience\": 0.8\n  },\n  \"cohesive_goals\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n    \"salience\": 0.8\n  }\n}\n\n--- Tension Indices (0.0-1.0, higher = more contradiction) ---\nIdentity Tension: 0.0800\nEmotional Tension: 0.0000\nSuccess Tension: 0.0338\nRelational Tension: 0.2375\nGoal Tension: 0.0000\n\n--- Strategic Contradiction Index (0.0-1.0, higher = more incoherent) ---\nStrategic Contradiction Index: 0.0673\nInterpretation: Lower values indicate consistent, coherent messaging; higher values indicate strategic contradictions and mixed appeals.\n\n--- Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices (-1.0 to +1.0) ---\nInterpretation:\n  - Positive values indicate discourse supporting social cohesion, positive relations, and democratic health.\n  - Negative values indicate discourse promoting fragmentation, conflict, and undermining democratic health.\n  - The magnitude reflects the strength of these tendencies, weighted by rhetorical salience.\nDescriptive Cohesion Index: -0.7568\nMotivational Cohesion Index: -0.7467\nFull Cohesion Index: -0.7568\n```\n\n### Analysis of Results:\n\nGiven the input scores, the discourse analyzed appears to be highly fragmentative and adversarial.\n\n*   **High Tension**: Noticeably high \"Relational Tension\" (0.2375) and moderate \"Identity Tension\" (0.0800). This indicates significant contradictions or mixed messaging regarding relationships and identity framing, with a strong emphasis on negative relational dynamics (high Enmity). The \"Emotional Tension\" and \"Goal Tension\" are zero because the scores for the opposing dimensions were either very close or one of the dimensions had a score of zero, meaning there wasn't a strong contradiction in emphasis.\n*   **High Strategic Contradiction Index**: The \"Strategic Contradiction Index\" is relatively low (0.0673), suggesting that while there are tensions, the overall messaging might not be wildly incoherent. However, the low tension in emotional and goal dimensions doesn't mean those are cohesive; it simply means there's no significant *contradiction* in their salience relative to their scores.\n*   **Highly Negative Cohesion Indices**:\n    *   The **Descriptive Cohesion Index (-0.7568)** is strongly negative, driven by high Enmity (0.95 salience) overwhelming Amity (0.75 salience), and high Envy (0.7 salience) over Compersion (0.05 salience). The high Fear score also contributes to this negative tendency.\n    *   The **Motivational Cohesion Index (-0.7467)** is also strongly negative, reflecting the combined impact of relational and emotional negativity, further reinforced by highly fragmentative goals (0.8 salience) over cohesive goals (0.8 salience).\n    *   The **Full Cohesion Index (-0.7568)** is also strongly negative, indicating that across all dimensions, the discourse leans heavily towards fragmentation, tribalism, fear, envy, enmity, and divisive goals, significantly undermining social cohesion and democratic health.\n\nIn summary, based on these scores, the discourse is characterized by a strong emphasis on group supremacy, fear, envy, enmity, and divisive goals, with little to no counterbalancing positive appeals. This pattern suggests a discourse that actively undermines social cohesion and potentially damages democratic health.",
