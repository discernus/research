This is difference made legal.\",\n  \"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate...\",\n  \"Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust.\",\n  \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.\",\n  \"Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.\",\n  \"...when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters...\",\n  \"when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments...\",\n  \"If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as 'rabble rousers' ... millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.\",\n  \"Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away... and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.\",\n  \"We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.\",\n  \"They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment. I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future.\",\n  \"when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society...\",\n  \"Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.\",\n  \"I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.\",\n  \"I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big in quality.\",\n  \"One day the South will recognize its real heroes... They will be the James Merediths... They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro women... They will be the young high school and college students...\",\n  \"Its ugly record of brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation.\",\n  \"But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters...\",\n  \"Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself...\",\n  \"I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.\",\n  \"I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers.\",\n  \"I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother.\",\n  \"All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality.\",\n  \"Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an 'I it' relationship for an 'I thou' relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things.\",\n  \"Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness?\",\n  \"We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\",\n  \"Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood.\",\n  \"Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.\"\n]\n```",
