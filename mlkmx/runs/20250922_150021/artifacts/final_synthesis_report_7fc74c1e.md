### **Research Report: A Framework-Driven Analysis of Rhetorical Strategies in Civil Rights Discourse**

**Experiment ID:** mlkmx
**Framework:** Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4
**Corpus:** MLK-MX Civil Rights Speeches Corpus

### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a methodological blueprint for a computational analysis of two seminal texts from the American Civil Rights Movement: Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from Birmingham Jail" (1963) and Malcolm X's "The Ballot or the Bullet" (1964). The analysis is designed to be conducted using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4, a systematic methodology for quantifying rhetorical dimensions in political discourse. In the absence of statistical execution results, this document focuses on deconstructing the framework's architecture, outlining the experimental intent, and specifying the analytical pathways and expected statistical patterns that would validate or challenge the framework's theoretical underpinnings.

The central thesis of the intended research is that the CFF can empirically quantify the starkly divergent rhetorical strategies of King and Malcolm X, revealing systematic differences in their approaches to identity, emotional climate, and social cohesion. It is hypothesized that the statistical data will show King's discourse aligning with the CFF's "cohesive" dimensions (e.g., `individual_dignity`, `amity`, `hope`) and Malcolm X's discourse aligning with its "fragmentative" counterparts (e.g., `tribal_dominance`, `enmity`, `fear`). The analysis of derived metrics, particularly the `Full Cohesion Index`, is expected to yield significantly different polarity scores for each text, providing a quantitative measure of their opposing philosophical orientations toward social change. As Martin Luther King Jr. stated, his vision aimed to "make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm
