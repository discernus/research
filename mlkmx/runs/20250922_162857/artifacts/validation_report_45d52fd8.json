      "description": "The `default` analysis prompt in the framework contains a potentially ambiguous instruction: 'The derived_metrics are calculated automatically based on your dimensional scores, but you must include both sections in your JSON output.' This could lead an LLM to unnecessarily attempt the calculations. While the system is robust to this, the prompt could be clearer.",
      "impact": "No direct impact on execution as the platform's orchestration layer correctly handles metric calculation. This is a suggestion for improving prompt clarity and future-proofing.",
      "fix": "Consider rephrasing the instruction to: 'You must provide the `dimensional_scores`. A `derived_metrics` object must also be present in your output, but it should be left empty. The Discernus platform will automatically perform all calculations and populate this section.'",

      "description": "The experiment is configured to use the `default` analysis variant, which evaluates all ten dimensions in a single pass. The framework also provides high-quality `sequential_` variants designed to analyze one conceptual axis at a time, which can reduce cognitive load on the model and improve analytical precision.",
      "impact": "Using the `default` variant is valid and will execute correctly. However, leveraging the sequential variants may yield more nuanced and reliable dimensional scores for this complex framework.",
      "fix": "For potentially higher-fidelity results, consider modifying the experiment to orchestrate multiple analysis steps using the five sequential variants (`sequential_identity`, `sequential_emotional`, etc.) and then aggregating the results. This is an enhancement, not a required change.",
