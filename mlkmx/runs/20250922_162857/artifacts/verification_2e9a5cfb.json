  "reasoning": "The provided `computation_code` largely consists of comments suggesting hypothetical calculation logic for derived metrics, rather than executable code that produces the provided `derived_metrics`. Upon re-execution using the suggested logic and comparing with the provided metrics (rounded to 2 decimal places per APA standard), significant discrepancies were found for most values:\n\n- **identity_tension**: Recomputed 0.80, Provided 0.08. (Discrepancy)\n- **emotional_tension**: Recomputed 0.30, Provided 0.05. (Discrepancy)\n- **success_tension**: Recomputed 0.60, Provided 0.00. (Discrepancy)\n- **relational_tension**: Recomputed 0.30, Provided 0.07. (Discrepancy)\n- **goal_tension**: Recomputed 0.00, Provided 0.00. (Matches)\n- **strategic_contradiction_index**: Recomputed 0.40, Provided 0.04. (Discrepancy)\n- **identity_cohesion_component**: Recomputed 0.80, Provided -0.80. (Discrepancy in value and sign)\n- **descriptive_salience_total**: Recomputed 3.60, Provided 4.20. (Discrepancy)\n- **motivational_salience_total**: Recomputed 2.40, Provided 5.80. (Discrepancy)\n- **full_salience_total**: Recomputed 6.80, Provided 6.80. (Matches)\n\nFor `emotional_cohesion_component`, `success_cohesion_component`, `relational_cohesion_component`, `goal_cohesion_component` (as a cohesion component), `descriptive_cohesion_index`, `motivational_cohesion_index`, and `full_cohesion_index`, no explicit calculation logic was provided within the comments, making re-computation and verification impossible with the given information. The inconsistencies indicate that the derived metrics are not calculated using the simple logic suggested in the comments.",
