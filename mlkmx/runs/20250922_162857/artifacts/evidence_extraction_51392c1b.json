And if you're black and you not thinking black at this late date, well, I'm sorry for you.\",\n  \"As long as you fight it on the level of civil rights, you're under Uncle Sam's jurisdiction... We intend to expand it from the level of civil rights to the level of human rights.\",\n  \"Now you tell me how can the plight of everybody on this Earth reach the halls of the United Nations and you have twenty-two million Afro-Americans whose churches are being bombed, whose little girls are being murdered, whose leaders are being shot down in broad daylight?\",\n  \"This afternoon we want to talk about the ballot or the bullet. The ballot or the bullet explains itself.\",\n  \"Whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap.\",\n  \"it's the ballot or the bullet. It's liberty or it's death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody.\",\n  \"once you can create some employment in the community where you live, it will eliminate the necessity of you and me having to act ignorantly and disgracefully, boycotting and picketing some cracker someplace else trying to beg him for a job.\",\n  \"But today, this country can become involved in a revolution that won't take bloodshed. All she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything.\",\n  \"once you\u2026feel that this philosophy will solve your problem, go join any church where that's preached.\",\n  \"You would never have found\u2014you can't open up a black store in a white community. White man won't even patronize you. And he's not wrong. He got sense enough to look out for himself. It's you who don't have sense enough to look out for yourself.\",\n  \"because these Negroes, who have been misled, misguided, are breaking their necks to take their money and spend it with the Man, the Man is becoming richer and richer, and you're becoming poorer and poorer.\",\n  \"These Northern Democrats are in cahoots with the southern Democrats. They're playing a giant con game, a political con game.\",\n  \"Mr. Moderator, Rev. Cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and I see some enemies.\",\n  \"when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us against a enemy who is common to all of us.\",\n  \"Anytime you have to rely upon your enemy for a job, you're in bad shape. When you \u2014 and he is your enemy.\",\n  \"brothers and sisters and friends...\",\n  \"But if we keep our religion at home...when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us...\",\n  \"So I say in my conclusion, the only way we're going to solve it: we got to unite. We got to work together in unity and harmony. And black nationalism is the key.\",\n  \"it will take black nationalism to bring about the freedom of 22 million Afro-Americans, here in this country, where we have suffered colonialism for the past 400 years.\",\n  \"Just as it took nationalism to remove colonialism from Asia and Africa, it'll take black nationalism today to remove colonialism from the backs and the minds of twenty-two million Afro-Americans here in this country.\",\n  \"Revolutions overturn systems.
