And if you're black and you not thinking black at this late date, well, I'm sorry for you.\",\n  \"They don't hang you because you're a Baptist; they hang you 'cause you're black.\",\n  \"Now you tell me how can the plight of everybody on this Earth reach the halls of the United Nations and you have twenty-two million Afro-Americans whose churches are being bombed, whose little girls are being murdered, whose leaders are being shot down in broad daylight?\",\n  \"this has built up frustrations in the black community that makes the black community throughout America today more explosive than all of the atomic bombs the Russians can ever invent.\",\n  \"Whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap.\",\n  \"And in 1964, this seems to be the year. Because what can the white man use, now, to fool us?\",\n  \"once you can create some employment in the community where you live, it will eliminate the necessity of you and me having to act ignorantly and disgracefully, boycotting and picketing some cracker someplace else trying to beg him for a job.\",\n  \"today, this country can become involved in a revolution that won't take bloodshed. All she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything.\",\n  \"And it will take black nationalism to bring about the freedom of 22 million Afro-Americans, here in this country, where we have suffered colonialism for the past 400 years.\",\n  \"when you spend your dollar out of the community in which you live, the community in which you spend your money becomes richer and richer, the community out of which you take your money becomes poorer and poorer.\",\n  \"You, today, are in the hands of a government of segregationists. Racists, white supremacists, who belong to the Democratic party but disguise themselves as Dixiecrats.\",\n  \"Any time you throw your weight behind a political party that controls two-thirds of the government, and that party can\u2019t keep the promise that it made to you during election-time, and you\u2019re dumb enough to walk around continuing to identify yourself with that party, you\u2019re not only a chump but you\u2019re a traitor to your race.\",\n  \"Mr. Moderator, Rev. Cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and I see some enemies.\",\n  \"we have a fight that's common to all of us against a enemy who is common to all of us.\",\n  \"Anytime you have to rely upon your enemy for a job, you're in bad shape. ... and he is your enemy. You wouldn't be in this country if some enemy hadn't kidnapped you and brought you here.\",\n  \"Were we to come out here discussing religion, we'd have too many differences from the out start and we could never get together.\",\n  \"but when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us against a enemy who is common to all of us.\",\n  \"So I say in my conclusion, the only way we're going to solve it: we got to unite. We got to work together in unity and harmony. And black nationalism is the key.\",\n  \"Revolutions overturn systems. Revolutions destroy systems.\",\n  \"Only, you think that integration will get you freedom; I think that separation will get me freedom. We both got the same objective, we just got different ways of getting' at it.\",\n  \"just as it took nationalism to remove colonialism from Asia and Africa, it'll take black nationalism today to remove colonialism from the backs and the minds of twenty-two million Afro-Americans here in this country.\",\n  \"we going to do the same thing, only our gospel is black nationalism... And the gospel of black nationalism, as I told you, means you should control your own, the politics of your community, the economy of your community, and all of the society in which you live should be under your control.\",\n  \"So our people not only have to be reeducated to the importance of supporting black business, but the black man himself has to be made aware of the importance of going into business.\",\n  \"If you see where the NAACP is preaching and practicing that which is designed to make black nationalism materialize, join the NAACP. Join any kind of organization \u2013 civic, religious, fraternal, political or otherwise that's based on lifting the black man up and making him master of his own community.\"\n]\n```",
