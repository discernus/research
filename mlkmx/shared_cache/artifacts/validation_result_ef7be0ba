    "The experiment is designed as a comparative study between two speakers but relies on a corpus with only one document per speaker (N=1 per group). This sample size is insufficient for statistically valid hypothesis testing and severely limits the generalizability of any findings. The analysis is restricted to a descriptive comparative case study of two specific texts, not a general comparison of the speakers' overall rhetorical strategies."
