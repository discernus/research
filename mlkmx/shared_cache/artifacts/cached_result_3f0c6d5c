      "description": "The experiment is designed for comparative hypothesis testing, but the corpus size is statistically insufficient. The hypotheses (H1-H6) aim to determine if one speaker's scores are 'higher' than the other's, implying inferential statistical tests (e.g., t-test). However, the corpus provides only one document per speaker (n=1 for each group, N=2 total).",
      "impact": "This design violates the platform's statistical executability rules as defined in Experiment Specification v10.0 and Corpus Specification v8.0.2. The rules state that for N<4, only 'comparative case analysis' is permitted, and for inferential tests like ANOVA or t-tests, each group must have n\u22652. The experiment will be blocked because it attempts an underpowered analysis that cannot yield statistically significant results.",
      "fix": "To proceed, the researcher must either: 1) Expand the corpus to include at least two documents per speaker to enable valid statistical comparison. or 2) Reframe the Research Questions and Hypotheses in the 'experiment.md' to reflect a qualitative, descriptive case study comparison, removing language that implies statistical hypothesis testing (e.g., change 'will score higher' to 'is expected to show more evidence of').",
