# Civil Rights Rhetoric Comparison: Malcolm X vs. Martin Luther King Jr.

## Experiment Overview

This experiment compares the rhetorical strategies of two iconic civil rights leaders using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0 to analyze how different approaches to social change impact discourse cohesion and democratic health.

## Research Questions

### Primary Research Question
How do the rhetorical strategies of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. differ in their impact on social cohesion and democratic discourse, as measured by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework?

### Secondary Research Questions
1. **Identity Framing**: How do the two leaders differ in their use of tribal dominance versus individual dignity appeals?
2. **Emotional Climate**: What are the differences in fear-based versus hope-based messaging between the two approaches?
3. **Success Orientation**: How do they differ in their framing of envy versus compersion toward others' achievements?
4. **Relational Climate**: What are the differences in enmity versus amity positioning in their discourse?
5. **Goal Orientation**: How do their objectives differ in terms of fragmentative versus cohesive goals?
6. **Strategic Coherence**: Which approach demonstrates greater rhetorical consistency and coherence?

## Hypotheses

### H1: Identity Dimension Hypothesis
Malcolm X will score higher on tribal dominance appeals, emphasizing black nationalism and group solidarity, while MLK will score higher on individual dignity, emphasizing universal human worth and inclusive recognition.

### H2: Emotional Climate Hypothesis
Malcolm X will demonstrate higher fear-based messaging (crisis mentality, existential threats) while MLK will show higher hope-based messaging (progress orientation, optimistic vision).

### H3: Success Orientation Hypothesis
Malcolm X will show higher envy scores (resentment toward white success, zero-sum thinking) while MLK will demonstrate higher compersion (celebration of others' achievements, abundance mindset).

### H4: Relational Climate Hypothesis
Malcolm X will score higher on enmity (hostility, adversarial positioning) while MLK will score higher on amity (friendship appeals, cooperative framing).

### H5: Goal Orientation Hypothesis
Malcolm X will demonstrate higher fragmentative goals (divisive objectives, separation emphasis) while MLK will show higher cohesive goals (integrative objectives, unity building).

### H6: Cohesion Index Hypothesis
MLK's discourse will produce higher cohesion indices across all three levels (descriptive, motivational, and full cohesion) compared to Malcolm X's approach.

## Methodology

### Framework
- **Framework**: Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0
- **Analysis Variant**: Default variant (complete v10.0 implementation with salience and tension analysis)
- **Model Requirements**: Gemini 2.5 Pro for sophisticated dual-track analysis

### Analytical Approach
1. **Comprehensive Dimensional Analysis**: All ten dimensions across five opposing pairs will be analyzed using the CFF v10.0 framework
2. **Salience-Weighted Scoring**: Both intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience (0.0-1.0) will be measured for each dimension
3. **Tension Analysis**: Strategic contradictions will be calculated using the framework's tension formulas
4. **Cohesion Index Calculation**: Three levels of cohesion indices will be computed with salience weighting

### Expected Outcomes
- **Quantitative Results**: Dimensional scores, tension indices, and cohesion indices for both texts
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Evidence-based assessment of rhetorical strategies and their implications
- **Comparative Analysis**: Descriptive comparison of the two approaches across all framework dimensions

## Significance

This experiment addresses a critical question in civil rights history: how do different rhetorical approaches to social change impact community cohesion and democratic discourse? The findings will contribute to understanding:

1. **Historical Analysis**: Systematic comparison of two major civil rights philosophies
2. **Discourse Theory**: How rhetorical strategies affect social cohesion and democratic health
3. **Strategic Communication**: Implications for contemporary social movements and political discourse

## Definition of Done

The experiment will be considered complete when:
1. Both speeches have been analyzed using the CFF v10.0 framework
2. All dimensional scores, salience weights, and derived metrics have been calculated
3. Descriptive comparison between the two texts has been performed
4. A comprehensive synthesis report has been generated with findings, implications, and limitations
5. All artifacts have been properly stored with full provenance
