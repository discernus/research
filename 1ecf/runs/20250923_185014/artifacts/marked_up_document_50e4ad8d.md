# Document Analysis - Marked Up Text

[FEAR: We come here today with a great sense of misgiving.] It is true that [AMITY: we support the administration's civil rights bill.] [FEAR: We support it with great reservations, however.] Unless Title Three is put in this bill, [FEAR: there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South] while they engage in peaceful demonstrations. In its present form, this bill [FEAR: will not protect] the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must [FEAR: live in constant fear of a police state.] It [FEAR: will not protect] the hundreds and thousands of people who have been [FEAR: arrested upon trumped-up charges.]

What about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who [FEAR: face the death penalty] for engaging in peaceful protest? As it stands now, the voting section of this bill [FEAR: will not help] the thousands of black people who want to vote. It [FEAR: will not help] the citizens of Mississippi, of Alabama, and Georgia, who are qualified to vote but lack a sixth-grade education.

[HOPE: We must have legislation that will protect] the Mississippi sharecropper who is [FEAR: put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote.] [HOPE: We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation.] [FEAR: We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation.] [HOPE: We need a bill to ensure the equality] of [ENVY: a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year.] [HOPE: We must have a good FEPC bill.]

[AMITY: My friends], let us not forget that [HOPE: we are involved in a serious social revolution.] By and large, American politics is dominated by [ENMITY: politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation.] [MUDITA: There are exceptions, of course - we salute those] - but what political leader can stand up and say, "My party is the party of principles"? For [ENMITY: the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater.]

[HOPE: Where is our party?] [HOPE: Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington?] [HOPE: Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham?] [HOPE: Where is the political party that will protect the citizens of Albany, Georgia?]

Do you know that in Albany, Georgia, [FEAR: nine of our leaders have been indicted], not by Dixiecrats, but by [ENMITY: the federal government for peaceful protest?]

But [ENMITY: what did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead?] [FEAR: What did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead?] [ENMITY: What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby?] [FEAR: What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby?] To [ENMITY: those who have said, "Be patient and wait,"] we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but [HOPE: we want to be free now!]

[Applause] [Music] [Applause]

[FEAR: We are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again.] And then [ENMITY: you holler, "Be patient."] How long can we be patient? [HOPE: We want our freedom and we want it now!]

[Applause]

[FEAR: We do not want to go to jail], but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for [AMITY: love, brotherhood, and true peace.] [HOPE: love, brotherhood, and true peace.] [AMITY: I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation.] [HOPE: I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation.] Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation [HOPE: until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete.]

[HOPE: We must get in this revolution and complete the revolution.] For in the Delta of Mississippi, in southwest Georgia, in the Black Belt of Alabama, in Harlem, in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and all over this nation, [HOPE: the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom.]

[ENMITY: They're talking about slow down and stop.] [HOPE: We will not stop!] [ENMITY: All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!] [HOPE: All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!]

[Applause]

[FEAR: If we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress], [HOPE: the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington.] [HOPE: We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham.] But [AMITY: we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today.]

[Music] [Applause]

By the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, [ENMITY: we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces] and [HOPE: put them together in the image of God and democracy.] [HOPE: We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient!]

[Applause]
