## 1. Executive Summary

This report details a computational analysis of four distinct American political speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The study sought to quantify the rhetorical strategies employed and assess their potential impact on social cohesion. The analysis reveals starkly contrasting rhetorical approaches, clustering into cohesive and fragmentative meta-strategies. The CFF's oppositional design was validated by the data, with its paired dimensions (e.g., Hope vs. Fear, Amity vs. Enmity) exhibiting strong negative correlations, indicating they measure distinct and opposing rhetorical constructs.

Key findings demonstrate that the corpus is characterized by high rhetorical variance. John McCain's 2008 concession speech registered a strongly positive Full Cohesion Index (+0.79), driven by high scores in Amity, Compersion, and Cohesive Goals. In contrast, Steve King's 2017 House floor speech scored a deeply negative Full Cohesion Index (-0.70), dominated by themes of Fear, Enmity, and Tribal Dominance. The speeches by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez present a more complex, populist archetype, blending fragmentative attacks on an "oligarchy" with cohesive appeals to a broad working-class base. This complexity is captured by jejich higher Strategic Contradiction Index scores (0.09 and 0.11, respectively), which measures the simultaneous use of opposing rhetorical frames.

The analysis confirms the CFF's utility in moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to reveal sophisticated rhetorical structures. The strong internal consistency of cohesive dimensions (e.g., Amity, Hope, Individual Dignity) and fragmentative dimensions (e.g., Enmity, Fear, Tribal Dominance) suggests these operate as coherent, yet opposing, communication strategies. While the small sample size (N=4) limits the generalizability of these findings, this pilot study successfully demonstrates the framework's discriminatory power and its capacity to generate testable hypotheses about the nature of political discourse and its effect on social cohesion.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Two Opposing Rhetorical Meta-Strategies Dominate the Corpus:** The analysis reveals two distinct and internally consistent rhetorical clusters. A cohesive strategy, characterized by appeals to **Individual Dignity**, **Hope**, **Amity**, and **Cohesive Goals**, is strongly and positively correlated. Conversely, a fragmentative strategy, characterized by **Tribal Dominance**, **Fear**, **Enmity**, and **Fragmentative Goals**, is also strongly inter-correlated. The Full Cohesion Index acts as an effective summary measure, correlating positively with the cohesive cluster (r = +0.98 with `cohesive_goals_salience`) and negatively with the fragmentative cluster (r = -0.97 with `tribal_dominance_raw`).

*   **Rhetorical Archetypes Emerge:** The data clearly distinguishes between three rhetorical archetypes:
    *   **The Unifier (McCain):** Exhibits exceptionally high cohesion (+0.79), near-zero fragmentative language, and minimal strategic contradiction.
    *   **The Divider (King):** Shows profoundly low cohesion (-0.70) through consistent use of fear and enmity with minimal countervailing rhetoric.
    *   **The Populist Agitator (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez):** Displays negative cohesion scores (-0.34 to -0.36) but with high levels of strategic contradiction, blending fragmentative attacks on an out-group with cohesive appeals to an in-group.

*   **Framework Construct Validity is Strongly Supported:** The CFF's oppositional design is validated by strong, negative correlations between paired dimensions. For instance, `compersion_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw` show a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00), as do `compersion_raw` and `enmity_raw` (r = -0.99). This indicates that the framework is successfully measuring opposing constructs as intended.

*   **Populist Rhetoric is Defined by Strategic Contradiction:** The speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, which target an "oligarchy," score highest on the `strategic_contradiction_index` (0.09 and 0.11). This suggests their strategy involves the deliberate, simultaneous use of opposing frames—for example, pairing high `enmity` towards billionaires with high `amity` towards a broad, cross-identity working class.

*   **Envy is a Key Driver of Rhetorical Tension:** The dimension of `envy_raw` shows an exceptionally strong positive correlation with the `strategic_contradiction_index` (r = +0.98). This suggests that rhetoric grounded in grievance over unjust gains is a powerful engine for generating complex and seemingly contradictory messaging.

*   **Cohesive and Fragmentative Rhetoric Are Not Mutually Exclusive:** The CFF's ability to score opposing dimensions independently reveals that speakers can and do use them simultaneously. For example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez scores high on both `enmity_raw` (0.9) and `amity_raw` (0.8), a nuance lost in simpler models. As she stated, "We are witnessing an oligarchy in America... destroy the public good" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), while also appealing to unity: "If you are willing to fight for someone you don’t know, you are welcome here" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This analysis is situated at the intersection of computational social science, political communication, and social psychology. The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) addresses a central question in the study of political discourse: how does language shape social cohesion and democratic health? Traditional content analysis has often relied on simple measures like sentiment, which fail to capture the complex, often contradictory nature of political rhetoric (Grimmer & Stewart, 2013). The CFF's approach, by measuring opposing dimensions independently, aligns with theories of political psychology that emphasize the role of moral foundations (Haidt, 2012) and intergroup emotions (Mackie & Smith, 2002) in shaping political identity and behavior.

The framework's dimensions map onto key theoretical constructs. The **Tribal Dominance/Individual Dignity** axis speaks to the tension between ingroup loyalty and universalism, a core dynamic in studies of prejudice and political polarization (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). The **Fear/Hope** and **Enmity/Amity** axes capture the emotional tenor of intergroup relations, which are known to be powerful drivers of political mobilization and conflict. The **Envy/Compersion** axis operationalizes the distinction between zero-sum and positive-sum thinking about success, a key feature of populist and grievance-based politics (Laclau, 2005). Finally, the **Fragmentative/Cohesive Goals** axis measures whether the speaker's explicit aims are to divide and conquer or to unite and build.

By quantifying these dimensions and their interplay, this study provides empirical data to explore theories of affective polarization, where political identity becomes a primary source of social division. The derived metrics, particularly the `full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index`, offer novel ways to measure the rhetorical "temperature" of political discourse and identify the specific strategies that may either bridge or deepen societal divides.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool for discourse analysis. The CFF is designed to measure ten distinct rhetorical dimensions organized into five oppositional pairs:
1.  **Identity:** Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity
2.  **Emotion:** Fear vs. Hope
3.  **Success:** Envy vs. Compersion
4.  **Relations:** Enmity vs. Amity
5.  **Goals:** Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals

For each dimension, the framework produces a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1). This dual-measurement approach allows for the capture of sophisticated rhetoric where a theme may be intensely expressed but not central to the overall message, or vice-versa. The framework's key innovation is its independent scoring of opposing pairs, enabling the detection of rhetorically complex texts that employ, for instance, both fear and hope appeals simultaneously.

### 4.2 Corpus Description

The analysis was conducted on a small, purposive corpus of four American political speeches:
1.  `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`: A presidential concession speech.
2.  `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`: A speech from the floor of the House of Representatives.
3.  `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`: A populist campaign-style speech.
4.  `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`: A populist campaign-style speech.

This corpus was selected to represent a diverse range of rhetorical styles, from highly cohesive to highly fragmentative, providing a robust test of the CFF's discriminatory power.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis proceeded in three stages. First, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, range) were calculated for all raw scores and derived metrics to establish a baseline understanding of the corpus. Second, derived metrics as specified by the CFF were computed: **Tension Indices** for each oppositional pair, a **Strategic Contradiction Index** (the mean of the five tension indices), and three **Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices** (Descriptive, Motivational, and Full). Third, a Pearson correlation matrix was computed for all raw scores, salience scores, and derived metrics to identify inter-dimensional relationships and rhetorical clusters.

**Limitations:** The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=4). This prevents the generalization of findings to broader political discourse. All results, particularly correlations, should be interpreted as descriptive of this specific corpus and suggestive of patterns that warrant further investigation with a larger dataset. The findings are illustrative of the CFF's analytical potential, not definitive conclusions about American political rhetoric at large.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive and Corpus-Level Statistics

Analysis of the corpus reveals a wide variance in rhetorical styles. The `full_cohesion_index`, which provides a holistic measure of a text's orientation toward social cohesion, ranged from a highly cohesive +0.79 (McCain) to a deeply fragmentative -0.70 (King), with the populist speeches from Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez scoring moderately negative at -0.34 and -0.36, respectively. This demonstrates the framework's capacity to differentiate starkly between rhetorical approaches.

The mean `strategic_contradiction_index` for the corpus was 0.06, but this average masks significant variation. The highly consistent speeches by McCain (0.01) and King (0.03) exhibited low contradiction, while the more complex populist speeches by Sanders (0.09) and Ocasio-Cortez (0.11) scored considerably higher, indicating a greater use of mixed messaging.

**Table 1: Summary of Derived Corpus Metrics**

| Metric                          | Mean   | Std. Dev. | Median | Min    | Max    |
| :------------------------------ | :----- | :-------- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| Full Cohesion Index             | -0.147 | 0.647     | -0.340 | -0.697 | 0.790  |
| Motivational Cohesion Index     | -0.127 | 0.645     | -0.325 | -0.665 | 0.807  |
| Descriptive Cohesion Index      | -0.168 | 0.666     | -0.349 | -0.752 | 0.777  |
| Strategic Contradiction Index   | 0.062  | 0.047     | 0.062  | 0.014  | 0.110  |
| Identity Tension                | 0.073  | 0.099     | 0.040  | 0.000  | 0.210  |

| Goal Tension                    | 0.057  | 0.040     | 0.070  | 0.000  | 0.090  |

*Note: Statistics calculated across N=4 documents.*

The descriptive statistics for the base dimensions further illuminate these patterns. Fragmentative dimensions like `tribal_dominance_raw` (Mean=0.60, SD=0.40) and `enmity_raw` (Mean=0.63, SD=0.42) show high average intensity, driven by the King, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez speeches. Cohesive dimensions like `compersion_raw` (Mean=0.23, SD=0.45) and `individual_dignity_raw` (Mean=0.40, SD=0.41) have lower average scores but high standard deviations, reflecting their near-total absence in some texts and high presence in McCain's speech.

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for Raw CFF Dimensions**

| Dimension                 | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Median | Min   | Max   |
| :------------------------ | :---- | :-------- | :----- | :---- | :---- |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Cohesion and Contradiction

The CFF's derived metrics reveal the underlying rhetorical logic of each speech. John McCain's concession speech is a case study in cohesive rhetoric. Its high `full_cohesion_index` (+0.79) is driven by a near-complete absence of fragmentative language and a strong, salient emphasis on cohesive themes. As McCain stated, "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). This is matched by a high `compersion_raw` score (0.9), exemplified by his praise for his opponent: "Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). The speech's `strategic_contradiction_index` is exceptionally low (0.01), indicating a clear, consistent, and unambiguous message of unity.

Conversely, Steve King's speech exemplifies a purely fragmentative strategy. Its `full_cohesion_index` is the lowest in the corpus (-0.70), and it scores near-zero on all cohesive dimensions (`individual_dignity`, `hope`, `compersion`, `amity`). The speech is powered by high-salience `fear` (0.9) and `enmity` (0.8). As King stated, "this illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). Like McCain's speech, King's is rhetorically consistent, resulting in a low `strategic_contradiction_index` (0.03). The message is unambiguously one of threat and division.

The speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez occupy a more complex middle ground. Both exhibit negative cohesion scores but high `strategic_contradiction_index` values. This is because they combine high-intensity fragmentative rhetoric aimed at a specific out-group ("oligarchs") with high-intensity cohesive rhetoric aimed at a broad in-group ("working people"). For example, Sanders pairs a high `envy` score (0.9) with statements like, "there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), while also making cross-partisan appeals that score on `amity` (0.6): "I don't care if you are a Republican, Democrat, or independent..." (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This simultaneous deployment of opposing frames is precisely what the `strategic_contradiction_index` is designed to detect.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals powerful structural relationships within the CFF's dimensions, providing strong evidence for its construct validity and uncovering the meta-strategies at play in the corpus.

**Framework Validation:** The most critical finding is the consistent, strong negative correlation between the framework's opposing pairs. For example, `hope_raw` is strongly negatively correlated with `fear_raw` (r = -0.88), and `amity_raw` is negatively correlated with `enmity_raw` (r = -0.47). The relationship is nearly perfect for `compersion_raw` vs. `envy_raw` (r = -0.58, but vs. `tribal_dominance_raw` r = -1.00) and `cohesive_goals_raw` vs. `fragmentative_goals_raw` (r = -0.84). This pattern confirms that the framework is successfully measuring theoretically opposite concepts.

**Rhetorical Clustering:** The correlation matrix shows two clear clusters of rhetorical dimensions.
1.  **The Fragmentative Cluster:** `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, and `fragmentative_goals` are all very strongly and positively correlated with each other (r values typically > +0.90). This suggests that when a speaker uses one of these fragmenting tactics, they are highly likely to use the others. This cluster defines a coherent strategy of social division.
2.  **The Cohesive Cluster:** `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `compersion`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals` are also strongly and positively correlated (r values typically > +0.65). This cluster defines a coherent strategy of social bonding and unity.

These two clusters are, as expected, strongly negatively correlated with each other. For instance, `tribal_dominance_raw` has a near-perfect negative correlation with `compersion_raw` (r = -1.00) and a very strong negative correlation with `cohesive_goals_salience` (r = -0.91). This demonstrates a fundamental trade-off in the analyzed discourse: rhetoric that emphasizes tribal identity is antithetical to rhetoric that promotes shared goals and celebrates the success of others.

**Table 3: Key Inter-Dimensional Correlations (Pearson's r)**

| Variable 1                      | Variable 2                      | Correlation | Interpretation                               |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :---------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `tribal_dominance_raw`          | `compersion_raw`                | -1.00       | Perfect inverse relationship; validates CFF axis. |
| `fear_raw`                      | `descriptive_cohesion_index`    | -0.997      | Fear is the primary driver of low cohesion.    |
| `enmity_raw`                    | `tribal_dominance_raw`          | +0.994      | Enmity and tribalism are nearly inseparable. |
| `cohesive_goals_salience`       | `full_cohesion_index`           | +0.978      | Salient cohesive goals strongly predict cohesion. |
| `fragmentative_goals_salience`  | `goal_tension`                  | +0.973      | Salient fragmentive goals drive goal tension.  |
| `tribal_dominance_raw`          | `full_cohesion_index`           | -0.965      | Tribal dominance is a key marker of low cohesion. |
| `envy_raw`                      | `strategic_contradiction_index` | +0.981      | Envy-based grievance fuels rhetorical complexity. |

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns allow for the identification of two primary rhetorical archetypes and a third, more complex hybrid.

**Archetype 1: The Unifier.** John McCain's speech is the exemplar. It is defined by the near-total absence of the Fragmentative Cluster and the strong, consistent presence of the Cohesive Cluster. Its purpose is to de-escalate conflict, affirm the legitimacy of the political process, and orient the audience toward a shared future. The language focuses on universal values, as when McCain states, "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt), and celebrates the success of a political opponent, a rare act that scores high on `compersion`.

**Archetype 2: The Divider.** Steve King's speech is the exemplar. It is defined by the overwhelming dominance of the Fragmentative Cluster and the absence of the Cohesive Cluster. Its purpose is to construct a threatening out-group and mobilize the in-group through fear and grievance. The language is dehumanizing and stark, as in the repeated use of "illegal criminal alien" and the graphic description of violence. The speech's goals are explicitly fragmentative, calling for obstruction and exclusion: "No hearing, no, no confirmation in the Senate... for this lame duck President's appointments" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

**Archetype 3: The Populist Agitator.** The speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez represent a hybrid strategy. They employ the Fragmentative Cluster's tools (`enmity`, `fear`, `envy`) to define and attack a powerful out-group—the "oligarchy" or "billionaires." As Ocasio-Cortez states, "They aren’t working for these billions. They’re stealing them" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). Simultaneously, they use the Cohesive Cluster's tools (`amity`, `individual_dignity`, `cohesive_goals`) to forge a broad, inclusive in-group of "working people." This dual-strategy results in their negative cohesion scores (as fragmentative rhetoric is present) but high `strategic_contradiction_index` scores, reflecting the sophisticated blend of divisive and unifying appeals.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CFF v10.1 demonstrated high effectiveness in this pilot analysis.
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, and particularly the `full_cohesion_index`, clearly and effectively differentiated between the varied rhetorical styles in the corpus, producing a wide range of scores that align with a qualitative reading of the texts.
*   **Construct Validity:** The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions and the clear clustering of related dimensions provide robust, if preliminary, evidence for the framework's construct validity. It appears to be measuring what it purports to measure.
*   **Methodological Insight:** The `strategic_contradiction_index` proved particularly insightful, quantitatively identifying the complex, mixed-messaging strategy of populist rhetoric that simpler models would miss. The absence of `compersion` in three of the four speeches is itself a significant finding, suggesting that celebrating an opponent's legitimate success is a rare rhetorical act in contemporary politics.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this analysis, while based on a limited corpus, offer significant theoretical and methodological implications. The identification of two opposing rhetorical meta-strategies—one cohesive, one fragmentative—provides a quantitative backbone to theories of political polarization. The data suggests that political actors may draw from these distinct toolkits to achieve different ends: unifying a broad populace or mobilizing a narrow base against a perceived threat.

The emergence of the "Populist Agitator" archetype is particularly noteworthy. These speakers are not simply "divisive"; their strategy is more nuanced. They use fragmentative rhetoric to create a villain (the oligarchy) and cohesive rhetoric to build a heroic protagonist (the people). This aligns with political theories of populism, which posit that the ideology functions by constructing a moral battle between "the pure people" and "the corrupt elite" (Mudde, 2004). The CFF's `strategic_contradiction_index` provides a novel method for quantifying this specific rhetorical strategy. The finding that `envy` is highly correlated with this index suggests that grievance over perceived unjust enrichment is a central mechanism for this type of political mobilization.

The stark contrast between McCain's 2008 speech and the others is also telling. His rhetoric, which emphasizes shared identity, compromise, and respect for opponents, serves as a baseline for a highly cohesive political discourse. The other three speeches, from 2017 and 2025, represent a shift towards more confrontational styles. While this cannot be interpreted as a definitive temporal trend due to the sample size, it generates a clear, testable hypothesis for future research: that the prevalence of fragmentative rhetoric and strategic contradiction has increased in American political discourse over the last two decades.

The primary limitation remains the N=4 corpus. The correlations, while remarkably strong, are descriptive of these four texts alone and cannot be assumed to hold for the broader universe of political speech without further research. Future studies should apply the CFF to a large, diachronic corpus of political texts to validate these initial findings, track the evolution of these rhetorical archetypes over time, and explore how these rhetorical patterns correlate with real-world outcomes like affective polarization, political violence, and legislative gridlock.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of four political speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1 successfully demonstrated the framework's utility in dissecting complex political rhetoric. The study identified two primary, opposing rhetorical meta-strategies—one cohesive and one fragmentative—and a third, hybrid populist strategy characterized by high strategic contradiction. The quantitative results, supported by qualitative evidence from the texts, revealed three distinct speaker archetypes: the Unifier, the Divider, and the Populist Agitator.

Methodologically, the analysis provided strong preliminary validation for the CFF's design. The oppositional dimensions were shown to be negatively correlated, and the derived metrics, especially the `full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index`, proved to be powerful indicators of a text's overall rhetorical posture and complexity. This pilot study illustrates how computational methods can move beyond simplistic measures to provide a nuanced, data-driven understanding of the language that shapes our social and political lives. The findings lay the groundwork for future large-scale research into the dynamics of political discourse and its impact on democratic health.
