    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with clear, strong rhetorical themes that map well to the framework's dimensions. The analysis focuses on the explicit populist and class-based framing, which presents a strong 'us vs. them' narrative (working people vs. oligarchs). The speaker simultaneously employs rhetoric of high enmity towards the out-group and high amity towards the in-group, making this a complex text that benefits from independent dimensional scoring."
