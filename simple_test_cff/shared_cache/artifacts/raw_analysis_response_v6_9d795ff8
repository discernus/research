    "analysis_notes": "The analyst assessed the document, a political speech, based on the provided framework. The speech has a very strong and clear rhetorical profile, characterized by high levels of fear, enmity, and tribalism, with almost no presence of the opposing dimensions like hope, amity, or individual dignity. The evidence for the dominant themes is explicit and repeated, leading to high confidence in the scoring. The salience scores reflect that the speech's central purpose revolves around creating an in-group/out-group dynamic based on legal status and perceived constitutional loyalty, and using fear-based narratives to justify fragmentative policy goals."
