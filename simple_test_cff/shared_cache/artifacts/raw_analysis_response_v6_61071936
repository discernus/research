    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic example of populist economic rhetoric, making the dimensions of Envy, Enmity, and Fragmentative Goals highly prominent. The text clearly defines an in-group (the American people/99%) and an out-group (the oligarchs/1%), framing the relationship as a zero-sum conflict. Cohesive dimensions like Hope and Amity are present but are primarily used as a call to action for the in-group to unite against the out-group, rather than as broader, society-wide appeals."
