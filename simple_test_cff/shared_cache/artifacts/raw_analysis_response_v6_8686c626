    "analysis_notes": "The document presents a strong, populist, class-based narrative. The primary rhetorical strategy is to establish a conflict between an oligarchy/billionaire class ('them') and the American people ('us'). This makes dimensions like Enmity, Envy, and Tribal Dominance highly intense and salient. Cohesive dimensions like Amity and Hope are present but are framed as tools for the in-group's struggle rather than universal appeals."
