    "The research questions stated in the experiment's human-readable abstract ('What are the baseline cohesion and tension scores for the documents in the sample corpus?') do not align with the specific research question provided in the machine-readable configuration ('Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion than populist styles?'). The machine-readable question is the operational one for the experiment.",
    "The experiment's research question, 'Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion than populist styles?', requires a comparison between a single 'institutional' document (McCain 2008) and three 'populist' documents. With N=1 for institutional discourse and N=3 for populist styles, drawing statistically robust conclusions about general 'styles' is severely limited."
