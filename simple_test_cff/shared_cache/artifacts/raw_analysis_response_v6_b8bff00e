    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with a strong populist, class-based rhetorical structure. It consistently frames the central conflict as 'working people' versus a corrupt 'oligarchy'. This leads to high scores on opposing dimensions (e.g., Enmity and Amity), as the speaker calls for internal group solidarity (Amity) to effectively wage a political battle against an external group (Enmity). The rhetoric is intense and focused, making for clear evidence for most dimensions."
