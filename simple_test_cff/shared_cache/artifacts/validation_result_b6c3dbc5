    "The research question in the experiment's human-readable section (\"What are the baseline cohesion and tension scores for the documents in the sample corpus?\") is purely descriptive, while the question in the machine-readable `questions` list (\"Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion than populist styles?\") is comparative and more specific.",
    "The framework's prose title, \"Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1\", is inconsistent with the version specified in the machine-readable metadata appendix, which is `framework_version: \"10.0.0\"`.",
    "The corpus contains only 4 documents (N=4), which is insufficient for robust statistical analysis. The research question compares one 'institutional' document against three 'populist' documents."
