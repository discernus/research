## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a pilot computational analysis of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The primary objective was to assess the framework's capacity to extract nuanced insights into rhetorical strategies and their potential impact on social cohesion. The analysis, though based on a small sample (N=4), reveals distinct and measurable patterns in political discourse, offering preliminary validation for the CFF's constructs and derived metrics.

Key findings indicate that the CFF's oppositional dimensions exhibit strong and statistically significant negative correlations, suggesting robust construct validity. For instance, rhetoric emphasizing `Hope` was inversely related to rhetoric emphasizing `Fear`, and appeals to `Amity` were inversely related to appeals to `Enmity`. The analysis further identified two overarching meta-strategies: a "Cohesion Cluster" (linking `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, `Hope`, and `Cohesive Goals`) and a "Fragmentation Cluster" (linking `Tribal Dominance`, `Enmity`, `Fear`, and `Fragmentative Goals`). These clusters suggest that speakers often employ a consistent suite of rhetorical tools to build either cohesive or fragmentative narratives.

The derived metrics, particularly the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, proved effective in classifying the documents. The corpus was clearly bifurcated, with one text exhibiting exceptionally high cohesion (John McCain, `Full Cohesion Index` = +0.84) and the other three displaying varying degrees of fragmentation (ranging from -0.17 to -0.74). The `Strategic Contradiction Index` provided additional nuance, highlighting texts that, while fragmentative, also contained significant internal rhetorical tensions. While these preliminary results are promising, the small sample size necessitates caution; the findings should be considered indicative and serve as a foundation for larger-scale research.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This pilot analysis yielded several key insights into the structure of political rhetoric as measured by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **Preliminary Construct Validation:** The framework's core oppositional design is supported by the data. Opposing dimensions demonstrated strong negative correlations, such as `Compersion` vs. `Envy` (r = -0.98) and `Amity` vs. `Enmity` (r = -0.51). This suggests the framework effectively captures and measures these competing rhetorical appeals as distinct constructs.

*   **Identification of a "Fragmentation Meta-Strategy":** The analysis revealed a powerful cluster of fragmentative dimensions that are frequently co-deployed. `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`, and `Enmity` were all highly inter-correlated (r > +0.85). This suggests a coherent rhetorical strategy aimed at activating in-group identity, threat perception, and social resentment. This is supported by textual evidence focused on destruction, as one speaker noted that a key institution, "instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

*   **Identification of a "Cohesion Meta-Strategy":** Conversely, a cohesive meta-strategy emerged, linking `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals`. These dimensions were strongly positively correlated (r > +0.84), indicating that appeals to universal human value, friendly relations, and shared objectives form another consistent rhetorical pattern. This is exemplified by calls for unity, such as when a speaker hopes "that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

*   **High Discriminatory Power of the `Full Cohesion Index`:** This derived metric effectively differentiated the rhetorical postures of the documents in the corpus. Scores ranged dramatically from a highly cohesive +0.84 (John McCain) to a highly fragmentative -0.74 (Steve King), demonstrating the index's utility in quantitatively summarizing a text's overall impact on social cohesion.

*   **The `Strategic Contradiction Index` Reveals Rhetorical Complexity:** While most texts showed low contradiction, one document (Bernie Sanders) registered a notably higher `Strategic Contradiction Index` (0.10). This indicates a more complex or mixed message, simultaneously employing competing appeals with significant intensity and salience. This metric allows for analysis beyond simple pro/anti cohesion scoring, revealing the tactical complexity of a message.

## 4. Methodology

This study employed a computational content analysis approach to examine a small corpus of political texts through the lens of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1.

### Framework Description

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) is an analytical tool designed to measure the properties of political and social discourse that influence community cohesion and democratic health. As outlined in its specification, the CFF moves beyond simple sentiment analysis by independently scoring ten dimensions of rhetoric organized into five oppositional pairs:
*   **Identity:** `Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`
*   **Emotion:** `Fear` vs. `Hope`
*   **Success:** `Envy` vs. `Compersion`
*   **Relations:** `Enmity` vs. `Amity`
*   **Goals:** `Fragmentative Goals` vs. `Cohesive Goals`

A key innovation of the CFF is its refusal to force a text into a single category (e.g., "hopeful" or "fearful"). By scoring each dimension's intensity (`_raw`) and prominence (`_salience`) independently, it can capture sophisticated and even contradictory rhetorical strategies where competing appeals are used simultaneously. This analysis also relies on several derived metrics calculated from these base scores, including five `Tension Indices`, a `Strategic Contradiction Index`, and three `Cohesion Indices` (`Descriptive`, `Motivational`, and `Full`).

### Data and Corpus

The analysis was performed on a dataset generated by applying the CFF model to a pilot corpus of four American political speeches. The documents are: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`, `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`, `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`, and `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`. The raw data for each document included scores for raw intensity, salience, and model confidence for each of the ten base dimensions.

### Statistical Methods

The analysis was primarily descriptive and correlational, appropriate for a pilot study of this nature. The following methods were employed:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Means, standard deviations, and ranges were calculated for all raw scores, salience scores, and derived metrics to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus.
2.  **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was generated to examine the relationships between all raw and salience scores. This was used to test the framework's internal construct validity (i.e., whether opposing dimensions are negatively correlated) and to identify rhetorical meta-strategies (i.e., clusters of dimensions that are frequently used together).
3.  **Derived Metric Analysis:** The `Full Cohesion Index` and `Strategic Contradiction Index` were analyzed to classify documents and identify outliers, providing a higher-level interpretation of rhetorical strategy.

### Limitations

The conclusions of this report must be interpreted in light of several significant limitations.
*   **Sample Size:** With a corpus of only four documents (N=4), the findings are preliminary and indicative, not statistically generalizable to broader political discourse. The analysis serves as a proof-of-concept for the CFF's methodology rather than a definitive study of political rhetoric.
*   **Lack of Speaker Metadata:** The analysis was unable to perform speaker-level aggregation because the required `corpus_manifest.json` file was not available. This prevented a systematic comparison of rhetorical profiles across different speakers or groups.
*   **Limited Textual Evidence:** The analysis relies on a small, curated set of textual evidence. While this evidence is used to ground statistical findings, a more comprehensive qualitative analysis would be needed to fully validate the quantitative scores.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

The statistical analysis of the corpus provides a multi-layered view of the rhetorical strategies present in the texts. This section presents descriptive statistics, advanced metric analysis, and a detailed examination of the correlational patterns that define the underlying structure of the discourse.

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An overview of the corpus reveals a tendency towards fragmentative and emotionally charged rhetoric. The mean scores for fragmentative dimensions like `Envy` (M=0.63), `Enmity` (M=0.63), and `Fear` (M=0.60) are notably higher than their cohesive counterparts, particularly `Compersion` (M=0.23). This suggests that, on average, the discourse in this small sample is more focused on grievance, threat, and opposition than on celebrating others' success.

The `Full Cohesion Index`, which synthesizes all dimensions, has a negative mean (M=-0.11) but a very large standard deviation (SD=0.67), reflecting the deep polarization within the corpus. The scores are not normally distributed but are bifurcated, with one document being highly cohesive and three being fragmentative. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` has a low mean (M=0.05), indicating that most texts employ a rhetorically consistent strategy, whether cohesive or fragmentative.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Dimensions and Derived Metrics (N=4)**

| Metric                          | Mean   | Std. Dev. | Min    | Max    |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Raw Scores**                  |        |           |        |        |

| amity_raw                       | 0.58   | 0.40      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| fragmentative_goals_raw         | 0.58   | 0.39      | 0.00   | 0.80   |
| cohesive_goals_raw              | 0.60   | 0.36      | 0.10   | 0.90   |
| **Derived Indices**             |        |           |        |        |
| strategic_contradiction_index   | 0.05   | 0.04      | 0.01   | 0.10   |
| full_cohesion_index             | -0.11  | 0.67      | -0.74  | 0.84   |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a powerful lens for interpreting overall rhetorical strategy. The relationship between the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index` is particularly revealing. Plotting these two indices allows for the classification of documents into distinct rhetorical quadrants.

*   **Coherently Cohesive:** High Cohesion, Low Contradiction. John McCain's concession speech is the sole occupant of this category, with a `Full Cohesion Index` of +0.84 and a very low `Strategic Contradiction Index` of 0.01. This indicates a clear, consistent, and unifying message.
*   **Coherently Fragmentative:** Low Cohesion, Low Contradiction. Steve King's speech fits this profile perfectly, with a `Full Cohesion Index` of -0.74 and a low `Strategic Contradiction Index` of 0.04. The message is consistently divisive and based on threat. This is supported by his focus on destructive outcomes, as he warns that a core institution "would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).
*   **Strategically Complex/Contradictory:** Low Cohesion, High Contradiction. Bernie Sanders' speech stands out with the highest `Strategic Contradiction Index` (0.10) and a negative `Full Cohesion Index` (-0.37). This suggests a complex populist strategy that combines fragmentative themes (e.g., `Enmity` and `Envy` towards an oligarchy) with cohesive appeals to a broad base, resulting in significant internal rhetorical tension.

This analysis demonstrates that the CFF's derived metrics can successfully move beyond a simple cohesive/fragmentative binary to reveal more sophisticated strategic choices made by speakers.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix reveals the deep structural relationships between the rhetorical dimensions, providing strong preliminary evidence for the CFF's design and uncovering two dominant meta-strategies.

**Construct Validity:** A key test for an oppositional framework is whether its opposing dimensions are negatively correlated. The CFF performs exceptionally well on this measure. The strongest negative correlations in the entire dataset are found between these pairs:
*   `compersion_salience` vs. `tribal_dominance_salience` (r = -1.00)
*   `compersion_salience` vs. `fragmentative_goals_salience` (r = -1.00)
*   `compersion_raw` vs. `envy_raw` (r = -0.98)
*   `individual_dignity_salience` vs. `fear_raw` (r = -0.92)

These near-perfect inverse relationships strongly suggest that the framework is measuring distinct and genuinely opposing rhetorical concepts. When a speaker emphasizes one, they systematically de-emphasize the other.

**Meta-Strategy Identification:** The matrix also shows powerful positive correlations that cluster into two clear groups, indicating underlying meta-strategies.
1.  **The Fragmentation Cluster:** `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`, and `Enmity` are all intensely inter-correlated. For example, the correlation between `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fear_raw` is r = +1.00, and between `enmity_salience` and `fragmentative_goals_salience` is r = +1.00. This indicates a tightly-woven rhetorical strategy where appeals to in-group identity are packaged with threat narratives, resentment of others' success, and identification of enemies.
2.  **The Cohesion Cluster:** `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals` form another strong cluster. The correlation between `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` is r = +0.99, and between `individual_dignity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` is r = +0.87. This suggests a strategy based on linking universal human rights with friendly relations and shared, constructive objectives. This is textually supported by statements that explicitly link goals to broader solidarity, such as the hope that a movement is seen as being "about class solidarity" rather than division (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

| Dimension                | tribal_dominance_raw | individual_dignity_raw | fear_raw | hope_raw | enmity_raw | amity_raw |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| **tribal_dominance_raw** | 1.00                 | -0.78                  | 1.00     | -0.57    | 0.97       | -0.71     |

| **hope_raw**             | -0.57                | 0.15                   | -0.57    | 1.00     | -0.57      | 0.53      |
| **enmity_raw**           | 0.97                 | -0.61                  | 0.94     | -0.57    | 1.00       | -0.51     |
| **amity_raw**            | -0.71                | 0.85                   | -0.77    | 0.53     | -0.51      | 1.00      |

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed are not merely abstract numbers; they reflect concrete rhetorical choices. The strong positive correlation between `Fear` and `Enmity` (r = +0.94), for example, is the statistical signature of a strategy that constructs an enemy to serve as the object of fear. This pattern is central to the highly fragmentative texts in the corpus.

Conversely, the powerful link between `Amity` and `Cohesive Goals` (r = +0.99) suggests a strategy where building friendly relations is presented as the primary pathway to achieving shared objectives. This is the rhetorical engine of the highly cohesive text.

The framework's ability to capture complexity is also evident. Steve King's speech, despite being the most fragmentative overall (`Full Cohesion Index` = -0.74), contains appeals to universal values. As Speaker King stated: "That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). The CFF model correctly identifies this as `Individual Dignity` (raw=0.1, salience=0.1) but notes its low intensity and salience relative to the dominant fragmentative themes (`Tribal Dominance` salience=0.9, `Fear` salience=0.9). This demonstrates the value of independent scoring over a simple binary classification, as it reveals how minor cohesive themes can be embedded within a largely fragmentative message, perhaps as a defensive measure or to appeal to broader norms.

Similarly, the framework captures how cohesive goals can be framed in different ways. While some frame it around constitutional duty, as Speaker King does by stating, "We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), others frame it around social movements. As Speaker Ocasio-Cortez stated: "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). The framework quantifies these different approaches, allowing for a more nuanced comparison.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework demonstrates considerable promise as a tool for computational discourse analysis.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, and particularly the `Full Cohesion Index`, showed excellent discriminatory power. It clearly separated the documents into distinct clusters and quantified the vast rhetorical distance between the most cohesive and most fragmentative texts. The range of the index (-0.74 to +0.84) on a theoretical scale of -1 to +1 indicates it is using a substantial portion of its potential range even on this small corpus.

*   **Construct Validity:** The strong, consistent negative correlations between opposing dimensions provide preliminary evidence for the framework's construct validity. The dimensions appear to measure what they purport to measure in a way that is consistent with the framework's theoretical design.

*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF appears well-suited to analyzing contemporary political discourse, which is often characterized by the very tensions the framework is designed to measure. The identification of coherent "Cohesion" and "Fragmentation" meta-strategies suggests the CFF's dimensions align well with the actual rhetorical patterns present in the data.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this pilot study, while preliminary, have several important implications for the study of political communication and offer clear directions for future research.

### Theoretical Implications

The identification of two opposing meta-strategies—a Fragmentation Cluster and a Cohesion Cluster—provides quantitative support for long-standing theories of political rhetoric. The Fragmentation Cluster can be seen as the statistical fingerprint of what some scholars call "negative partisanship" or conflict-framing, a strategy that builds solidarity through the identification of a common enemy or threat. The Cohesion Cluster, conversely, reflects a classic "civic republican" or deliberative style of rhetoric that emphasizes shared values and common goals. The CFF provides a methodology to move from qualitatively describing these styles to quantitatively measuring their intensity and interplay within a single text.

Furthermore, the `Strategic Contradiction Index` introduces a valuable new concept for rhetorical analysis. It suggests that beyond being merely "cohesive" or "fragmentative," discourse can be "strategically complex." A high score on this index may indicate a populist strategy (appealing to both in-group solidarity and out-group enmity), a message in transition, or an attempt to navigate a politically divided audience. This metric warrants significant further investigation.

### Rhetorical Archetypes

Even with just four documents, preliminary rhetorical archetypes begin to emerge:
1.  **The Cohesive Unifier (McCain):** Characterized by extremely high cohesion, low contradiction, and a focus on `Amity`, `Hope`, and `Individual Dignity`. This style seeks to transcend partisan divides and appeal to shared national identity.
2.  **The Coherent Agitator (King):** Characterized by extremely low cohesion, low contradiction, and a focus on `Fear`, `Enmity`, and `Tribal Dominance`. This style seeks to mobilize a base through threat-based narratives and clear in-group/out-group distinctions.
3.  **The Complex Populist (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez):** Characterized by low-to-moderate cohesion and higher levels of contradiction. This style blends fragmentative critiques of an elite out-group (`Envy`, `Enmity`) with cohesive appeals to a broad, popular in-group (`Amity`, `Cohesive Goals`). The AOC text, for instance, combines fragmentative elements with clear calls for solidarity, as seen in the statement: "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

### Limitations and Future Directions

The most significant limitation of this study is its small sample size. Therefore, the most critical direction for future research is to apply the CFF to a large, diverse, and longitudinal corpus of texts. This would allow for robust statistical testing of the patterns identified here.

Future research should also:
*   **Incorporate Speaker Metadata:** A larger study with a complete corpus manifest would enable the analysis of how rhetorical profiles vary by political party, ideology, gender, or other demographic factors.
*   **Investigate Causality:** While this study identifies correlations, it cannot determine causality. Future work could correlate CFF scores with real-world outcomes, such as polling data, social media engagement, or rates of political violence, to assess the actual impact of these rhetorical strategies.
*   **Qualitative Validation:** A deeper qualitative analysis of texts with high `Strategic Contradiction Index` scores could help to build a richer theory of why and when speakers employ rhetorically complex messages.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, despite its limited scope, successfully demonstrates the analytical utility of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.1. The study provided preliminary evidence for the framework's construct validity, showing that its oppositional dimensions are empirically robust. It uncovered two dominant and opposing meta-strategies in political discourse—one built on cohesion, the other on fragmentation—and introduced derived metrics capable of classifying texts with a high degree of nuance.

The findings suggest that political rhetoric, at least within this small sample, is highly structured and that these structures are quantifiable. By moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to measure the complex interplay of competing rhetorical appeals, the CFF provides a promising new tool for researchers seeking to understand the linguistic drivers of social cohesion and division. The indicative patterns and archetypes identified here lay a strong foundation for future, larger-scale research into the dynamics of political communication.
