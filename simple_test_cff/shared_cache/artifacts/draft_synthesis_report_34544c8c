## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis sought to evaluate the framework's utility in quantifying rhetorical strategies related to social cohesion and to identify initial patterns within the small corpus. Despite the significant limitation of a small sample size (N=4), the findings indicate that the CFF possesses strong discriminatory power, effectively distinguishing between cohesive and fragmentative rhetorical styles. The analysis reveals a clear bifurcation in rhetorical strategies: a "Cohesive" strategy characterized by appeals to `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals`, and a "Fragmentative" strategy strongly linking `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, and `fragmentative_goals`.

Key statistical findings support the CFF's construct validity. Opposing dimensions, such as `compersion_raw` and `tribal_dominance_salience`, exhibit a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00), while allied dimensions like `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` show a near-perfect positive correlation (r = 0.999). Furthermore, the framework's derived metrics, the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, successfully captured the overall rhetorical posture and internal complexity of each document. For instance, John McCain's 2008 concession speech registered as highly cohesive (0.840) and coherent (Contradiction Index: 0.014), whereas Steve King's 2017 floor speech was identified as highly fragmentative (-0.735) and similarly coherent (Contradiction Index: 0.044). Other texts displayed higher internal contradiction, suggesting more complex or mixed messaging.

While these results are indicative rather than conclusive due to the sample size, they demonstrate the CFF's potential as a sophisticated tool for discourse analysis. The framework moves beyond simple sentiment analysis to map the underlying architecture of political language, revealing how different rhetorical appeals cluster into coherent meta-strategies. Future research should apply this methodology to a larger, more diverse corpus to validate these preliminary patterns and explore their broader implications for democratic health and social solidarity.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Two Opposing Rhetorical Meta-Strategies Identified:** The analysis reveals two distinct and highly correlated clusters of rhetorical appeals. A "Fragmentative" strategy consistently combines appeals to `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, and `fragmentative_goals` (average inter-correlation r > 0.90). Conversely, a "Cohesive" strategy links `individual_dignity`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals`. This suggests that speakers often deploy these appeals as part of a coherent, overarching rhetorical package.
*   **Strong Support for Framework Construct Validity:** The CFF's oppositional design is strongly supported by the data. The analysis found a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) between the salience of `tribal_dominance` and the raw score of `compersion` (celebrating others' success). This powerful inverse relationship indicates the framework is effectively measuring theoretically opposed concepts.
*   **Cohesion and Contradiction as Independent Measures:** The data demonstrates that a message can be coherently cohesive or coherently fragmentative. John McCain's speech scored highest on the `Full Cohesion Index` (0.840) and lowest on the `Strategic Contradiction Index` (0.014), while Steve King's speech scored lowest on cohesion (-0.735) with a similarly low contradiction score (0.044). This highlights the framework's ability to separate a message's directional intent from its internal consistency.
*   **Fragmentative Goals Linked to Rhetoric of Destruction:** The analysis statistically links high scores in `fragmentative_goals` with rhetoric of threat and destruction. This is textually supported by speakers who score high on this dimension. For example, a document with a high `fragmentative_goals_raw` score (0.80) contains the statement that a core institution, "instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).
*   **High-Contradiction Rhetoric Signals Complex Messaging:** The `Strategic Contradiction Index` successfully identified texts with mixed messaging. The speech by Bernie Sanders, for example, registered the highest contradiction score (0.102), reflecting simultaneous high-salience appeals to both fragmentative (`enmity`, `tribal_dominance`) and cohesive (`amity`) dimensions, indicating a complex strategy of defining an out-group while also calling for in-group solidarity.
*   **Cohesive Goals Align with Calls for Solidarity:** The analysis shows a near-perfect correlation between `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` (r = 0.999). This statistical link is substantiated by textual evidence where calls for unity are explicit. As one speaker articulated, "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`), directly connecting a cohesive goal with a message of amity.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed for the nuanced analysis of political and social discourse. As outlined in its specification, the CFF moves beyond simplistic binary classifications (e.g., positive/negative sentiment) by independently scoring ten rhetorical dimensions organized into five oppositional pairs:
*   **Identity:** `tribal_dominance` vs. `individual_dignity`
*   **Emotion:** `fear` vs. `hope`
*   **Success:** `envy` vs. `compersion`
*   **Relation:** `enmity` vs. `amity`
*   **Goals:** `fragmentative_goals` vs. `cohesive_goals`

For each dimension, the framework generates a `raw` score (intensity of the appeal, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence of the appeal, 0-1). This dual-measurement approach allows the CFF to capture sophisticated rhetorical strategies where competing appeals may be used simultaneously. From these base scores, several derived metrics are calculated, including five `Tension Indices`, a `Strategic Contradiction Index` (the mean of the tension indices), and three `Cohesion Indices` (`descriptive`, `motivational`, and `full`) that provide an overall measure of a text's orientation toward social cohesion.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was conducted on a small pilot corpus (N=4) of political texts. Due to the absence of a `corpus_manifest.json` file, speaker identification was inferred from document filenames. The corpus includes:
1.  `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`
2.  `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`
3.  `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`
4.  `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`

The input data for this report is a structured JSON object containing the complete statistical results generated by a series of automated analysis functions. This includes descriptive statistics, a full Pearson correlation matrix, and the calculated values for all derived CFF metrics for each document.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational, appropriate for a pilot study of this nature. The primary statistical methods include:
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all raw scores, salience scores, and derived metrics to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus.
*   **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was computed for all raw and salience scores to identify relationships between rhetorical dimensions. Given the small sample size (N=4), correlation coefficients (r) are interpreted as indicators of the strength and direction of linear association within this specific dataset, not as generalizable findings. Statistical significance is not formally tested due to the low statistical power; instead, the magnitude of the correlations is used to identify noteworthy patterns.
*   **Derived Metric Analysis:** Interpretation of the CFF's unique indices (`Full Cohesion Index`, `Strategic Contradiction Index`) to assess overall rhetorical posture and complexity.

A significant limitation of this study is the **sample size of four documents**. This prevents the generalization of findings and the use of inferential statistics. All conclusions should be considered preliminary and indicative, serving primarily to demonstrate the analytical potential of the CFF and to generate hypotheses for future research on a larger corpus. Furthermore, the analysis of rhetorical profiles by speaker was skipped due to the missing corpus manifest, preventing formal grouping by speaker attributes.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An analysis of the descriptive statistics across the four documents reveals wide variance in the use of different rhetorical appeals, indicating the framework's ability to differentiate between texts. The mean `Full Cohesion Index` for the corpus was slightly negative (-0.110), with a large standard deviation (0.674), ranging from a highly cohesive score of 0.840 to a highly fragmentative score of -0.735. This demonstrates the framework's high discriminatory power.

Fragmentative dimensions such as `fear_raw` (M=0.60), `envy_raw` (M=0.63), and `enmity_raw` (M=0.63) were, on average, more prevalent than their cohesive counterparts `hope_raw` (M=0.43) and `compersion_raw` (M=0.23). Notably, the `success_tension` metric had a mean and standard deviation of 0, indicating that no document in this corpus simultaneously employed strong appeals to both `envy` and `compersion`, suggesting these are treated as mutually exclusive strategies by the speakers.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Raw Scores and Key Derived Metrics (N=4)**

| Metric                          | Mean    | Std. Dev. | Min     | Max     |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Raw Scores**                  |         |           |         |         |

| `enmity_raw`                    | 0.625   | 0.419     | 0.000   | 0.900   |
| `amity_raw`                     | 0.575   | 0.403     | 0.000   | 0.900   |

| `cohesive_goals_raw`            | 0.600   | 0.356     | 0.100   | 0.900   |
| **Derived Metrics**             |         |           |         |         |
| `strategic_contradiction_index` | 0.049   | 0.038     | 0.014   | 0.102   |
| `full_cohesion_index`           | -0.110  | 0.674     | -0.735  | 0.840   |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The CFF's derived metrics provide a holistic view of each document's rhetorical strategy. The `Full Cohesion Index` and `Strategic Contradiction Index` are particularly insightful when viewed together.

**Table 2: Cohesion vs. Contradiction Scores for Each Document**

| Document Name                                     | Full Cohesion Index | Strategic Contradiction Index | Rhetorical Profile          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`                 | 0.840               | 0.014                         | Coherently Cohesive         |
| `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`                 | -0.735              | 0.044                         | Coherently Fragmentative    |
| `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt` | -0.175              | 0.036                         | Complex / Fragmentative-Leaning |
| `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`      | -0.370              | 0.102                         | Contradictory / Fragmentative |

This analysis reveals four distinct profiles. John McCain's speech is a clear example of **Coherently Cohesive** rhetoric, maximizing pro-social appeals while minimizing internal tension. In contrast, Steve King's speech exemplifies a **Coherently Fragmentative** strategy, with strongly negative cohesion but also low internal contradiction. This suggests a focused, unambiguous message aimed at social division.

The other two documents show more complexity. Bernie Sanders' speech is the most notable, with the highest `Strategic Contradiction Index` (0.102). This high score arises from the simultaneous use of opposing appeals, such as high `enmity` (0.9) and moderate `amity` (0.6), creating a message that is both divisive and unifying, but directed at different groups. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's speech also shows negative cohesion but with much lower contradiction, suggesting a more focused, albeit still fragmentative-leaning, message. The textual evidence supports this complexity; for instance, a speaker can invoke a universalist principle while having a highly fragmentative overall score. As Steve King stated, "That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`), a statement scoring high on `individual_dignity` within a speech that scored highest on `tribal_dominance`.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies within the corpus. The results show a powerful and consistent clustering of dimensions, providing strong evidence for cohesive and fragmentative meta-strategies. Due to the large size of the full matrix, Table 3 presents a curated view of the most theoretically significant correlations between raw scores.

**Table 3: Selected Pearson Correlations (r) Between CFF Raw Score Dimensions (N=4)**

| Dimension A                 | Dimension B                 | Correlation (r) | Interpretation                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `tribal_dominance_raw`      | `fear_raw`                  | 0.996           | Very Strong Positive (Fragmentative Cluster) |
| `enmity_raw`                | `fragmentative_goals_raw`   | 0.993           | Very Strong Positive (Fragmentative Cluster) |
| `fear_raw`                  | `individual_dignity_raw`    | -0.819          | Strong Negative (Opposing Strategies)        |
| `amity_raw`                 | `cohesive_goals_raw`        | 0.999           | Very Strong Positive (Cohesive Cluster)      |
| `individual_dignity_raw`    | `cohesive_goals_raw`        | 0.868           | Strong Positive (Cohesive Cluster)           |
| `compersion_raw`            | `tribal_dominance_raw`      | -0.961          | Very Strong Negative (Opposing Strategies)   |
| `hope_raw`                  | `fear_raw`                  | -0.571          | Moderate Negative (Opposing Emotions)        |

The most striking finding is the emergence of two clear clusters. The **Fragmentative Cluster** (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, `enmity`, `fragmentative_goals`) shows extremely high positive inter-correlations. For example, the link between `tribal_dominance` and `fear` (r = 0.996) is nearly perfect, suggesting that, in this corpus, appeals to in-group dominance are almost always accompanied by appeals to fear.

Conversely, the **Cohesive Cluster** (`individual_dignity`, `hope`, `compersion`, `amity`, `cohesive_goals`) also shows strong internal positive correlations. The near-perfect correlation between `amity` and `cohesive_goals` (r = 0.999) indicates that when speakers in this sample articulate pro-social goals, they do so using the language of friendship and goodwill. As expected, the two clusters are strongly negatively correlated with each other, confirming the framework's bipolar design.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed are not merely abstract numbers; they reflect concrete rhetorical choices. The strong positive correlation between `enmity` and `fragmentative_goals` (r = 0.993) suggests that the articulation of goals that undermine cohesion is often achieved by defining an enemy. This is textually supported in the data. For instance, a speech with high scores on both dimensions frames a political process not as a negotiation but as a destructive act by an opposing force. As one speaker warned, a cherished institution "instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). This quote, classified under `fragmentative_goals`, exemplifies the rhetoric of destruction that correlates with high `enmity`.

In contrast, the powerful link between `amity` and `cohesive_goals` (r = 0.999) is substantiated by language that explicitly frames pro-social goals in terms of solidarity. A speaker with high scores on these dimensions urged listeners to view their movement through a lens of unity, stating, "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This statement, coded for `cohesive_goals`, perfectly illustrates the type of rhetoric driving the statistical correlation with `amity`.

An unexpected finding is the moderate negative correlation between `hope` and `fear` (r = -0.571). While they are opposing dimensions, the correlation is not as strong as other pairs (e.g., `compersion`/`tribal_dominance` at r = -0.961). This suggests that speakers are more likely to mix appeals to hope and fear than they are to mix other opposing concepts. This is a key insight that a simpler model might miss, and it is captured by the CFF's `emotional_tension` metric, which was non-zero for all four documents. This pattern warrants further investigation in a larger corpus to determine if it is a common feature of political discourse.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) demonstrates considerable effectiveness and methodological promise.

1.  **Discriminatory Power:** The framework effectively differentiated the four texts, assigning them to distinct rhetorical profiles (e.g., Coherently Cohesive vs. Contradictory/Fragmentative). The wide range of scores on the `Full Cohesion Index` (-0.735 to 0.840) highlights its ability to capture the full spectrum of rhetorical postures.
2.  **Construct Validity:** The analysis provides strong, albeit preliminary, evidence for the CFF's construct validity. The oppositional dimensions behaved as theoretically predicted, exhibiting strong negative correlations. The perfect negative correlation (r = -1.000) between `compersion_salience` and `tribal_dominance_salience` is a powerful piece of evidence that the framework is measuring distinct, opposing latent constructs. The clustering of allied dimensions into cohesive and fragmentative meta-strategies further supports the framework's internal logic.
3.  **Methodological Innovation:** The `Strategic Contradiction Index` proves to be a valuable innovation. It allows the analysis to move beyond a simple cohesive/fragmentative dichotomy and quantify the internal complexity of a message. Identifying a text as simultaneously fragmentative and highly contradictory (as with the Sanders speech) provides a more nuanced and accurate picture of its rhetorical strategy than a single score could. This is supported by textual evidence where a speaker known for fragmentative rhetoric also invokes cohesive themes, such as when Steve King references the need to "preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend" the Constitution (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`), a statement of `cohesive_goals` that contributes to his document's non-zero contradiction score.

The primary limitation in assessing framework-corpus fit is the corpus size itself. While the CFF performed well on these four diverse texts, its robustness and generalizability can only be confirmed with a much larger and more varied dataset.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this pilot study, while preliminary, carry significant implications for the computational analysis of political discourse. The clear identification of two opposing rhetorical meta-strategies—one cohesive, the other fragmentative—suggests that political language may be more systematically structured than is often assumed. The "Fragmentative" cluster (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`) and the "Cohesive" cluster (`individual_dignity`, `amity`, `hope`) appear to function as rhetorical "packages" that speakers deploy to achieve specific strategic aims.

This analysis allows for the identification of potential rhetorical archetypes. The four documents in this corpus map to four distinct patterns:
1.  **The Unifier (McCain):** High Cohesion, Low Contradiction. A strategy of de-escalation and goodwill, typical of concession speeches.
2.  **The Divider (King):** Low Cohesion, Low Contradiction. An unambiguous, coherent message aimed at solidifying an in-group by targeting an out-group.
3.  **The Populist Agitator (Sanders):** Low Cohesion, High Contradiction. A complex strategy that combines strong `enmity` towards an elite out-group with strong `amity` towards a "people" in-group, resulting in high internal contradiction.
4.  **The Advocate (Ocasio-Cortez):** Low Cohesion, Moderate Contradiction. A strategy focused on advocating for an in-group, which necessarily creates division with an out-group, but with less internal contradiction than the populist agitator.

The CFF's ability to quantify not just the direction (cohesion) but also the complexity (contradiction) of a message is a key theoretical contribution. It suggests that rhetorical effectiveness may not always correlate with coherence. A highly contradictory message might be more effective in certain political contexts, for example, by allowing different audiences to hear what they want to hear.

The primary limitation remains the N=4 sample size. These findings are suggestive, not definitive. Future research is essential to validate these patterns. A larger corpus would allow for the use of inferential statistics, factor analysis to confirm the cohesive/fragmentative clusters, and regression models to test the predictive power of CFF scores on real-world outcomes. Additionally, applying this framework to longitudinal data could reveal how rhetorical strategies evolve over time or in response to specific events.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though limited in scope, successfully demonstrates the analytical utility of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.1. The framework's multidimensional, oppositional design proved effective in capturing the nuanced and often contradictory nature of political rhetoric. The preliminary findings provide strong support for the CFF's construct validity, with allied dimensions clustering together and opposing dimensions showing strong negative correlations as theoretically predicted.

The key contribution of this study is the identification of distinct, measurable rhetorical profiles—such as "Coherently Cohesive" and "Contradictory/Fragmentative"—that emerge from the interplay between the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index`. By moving beyond simple sentiment analysis, this approach offers a more sophisticated and structured understanding of how language is used to build or break social bonds.

While the small sample size (N=4) means these findings must be interpreted with caution, they lay a strong foundation for future research. The patterns and archetypes identified here serve as testable hypotheses for larger-scale studies. This work underscores the potential of computational social science methods to provide rigorous, replicable, and deeply insightful analyses of the language that shapes our public life.
