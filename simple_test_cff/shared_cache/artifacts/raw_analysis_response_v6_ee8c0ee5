    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic political concession speech, characterized by a clear rhetorical strategy of de-escalating conflict, fostering national unity, and graciously acknowledging the victor. The scoring reflects this strong and consistent theme. Dimensions promoting division and conflict are almost entirely absent, while those promoting unity and respect are highly intense and salient. The analysis focuses on the explicit rhetorical choices made by the speaker."
