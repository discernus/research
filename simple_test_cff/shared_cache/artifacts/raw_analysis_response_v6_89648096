    "analysis_notes": "The document is a highly polarized political speech that maps clearly onto the framework's dimensions. The core rhetorical strategy involves defining an antagonistic out-group ('oligarchs') and calling for in-group solidarity ('working people') to defeat them. Opposing dimensions like Enmity/Amity and Fragmentative/Cohesive goals are used simultaneously, with hostility directed at the out-group and unity called for within the in-group. Salience scores reflect the centrality of this class-based conflict narrative."
