## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of a small corpus (N=4) of political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis aimed to evaluate the framework's capacity to extract nuanced insights into rhetorical strategies and their potential impact on social cohesion. Despite the limited sample size, the findings indicate that the CFF provides a robust and discriminating lens for discourse analysis, moving beyond simple sentiment to capture complex strategic patterns.

The results reveal a clear polarization within the corpus. The `Full Cohesion Index`, a key CFF metric, effectively separated documents into highly cohesive (e.g., John McCain's concession speech, Index = 0.84) and highly fragmentative (e.g., Steve King's house floor speech, Index = -0.74) categories. This separation is underpinned by strong, theoretically consistent correlations within the data. Cohesive dimensions like `Individual Dignity` and `Amity` were positively correlated, while being negatively correlated with their fragmentative counterparts like `Tribal Dominance` and `Enmity`. This pattern provides initial support for the framework's construct validity.

Furthermore, the analysis of derived metrics like the `Strategic Contradiction Index` uncovered sophisticated rhetorical strategies that would be missed by traditional methods. One document, for instance, registered the highest contradiction score (0.102), indicating a complex and potentially self-conflicting message that simultaneously employed cohesive and fragmentative appeals. These preliminary findings suggest the CFF is a promising tool for identifying rhetorical archetypes and mapping the landscape of political discourse. All conclusions should be considered indicative and require validation with a larger, more diverse corpus.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis, though preliminary due to the small sample size (N=4), yielded several key insights into the rhetorical patterns within the corpus and the effectiveness of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **Clear Rhetorical Polarization:** The framework's `Full Cohesion Index` effectively distinguished between cohesive and fragmentative discourse. The corpus contained documents at both extremes, with a maximum score of 0.84 (highly cohesive) and a minimum of -0.74 (highly fragmentative), demonstrating the framework's discriminatory power.
*   **Identification of Oppositional Rhetorical Clusters:** The analysis revealed two distinct and opposing rhetorical meta-strategies. A "fragmentative cluster" showed strong positive correlations between `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, and `Enmity` (e.g., `Fear_raw` and `Tribal_dominance_raw`, r = 0.996). A "cohesive cluster" linked `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals` (e.g., `Amity_raw` and `Cohesive_goals_raw`, r = 0.999).
*   **Initial Validation of Framework Structure:** The CFF's oppositional design was supported by the data. Opposing dimensions consistently showed strong negative correlations. For example, the salience of `Compersion` (celebrating others' success) and `Tribal Dominance` were perfectly negatively correlated (r = -1.00), suggesting they represent mutually exclusive rhetorical choices in this dataset.
*   **Detection of Strategic Contradiction:** The `Strategic Contradiction Index` successfully identified a document employing a mixed-motive rhetorical strategy. One speech registered a score of 0.102, more than double the next highest score, indicating a message that simultaneously leverages opposing appeals (e.g., hope and fear, enmity and amity) in a complex, potentially incoherent manner.
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Dominates in Intensity:** Across the small corpus, fragmentative dimensions tended to have higher average intensity scores than their cohesive counterparts. For instance, the mean raw score for `Fear` (0.60) was higher than for `Hope` (0.43), and `Envy` (0.63) was higher than `Compersion` (0.23), suggesting that, on average, the rhetoric in this sample leaned more heavily on divisive emotional appeals.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed for the nuanced analysis of political and social discourse. As described in its specification, the CFF moves beyond simplistic sentiment analysis by measuring ten distinct rhetorical dimensions organized into five oppositional pairs:
*   **Identity:** Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity
*   **Emotion:** Fear vs. Hope
*   **Success:** Envy vs. Compersion
*   **Relation:** Enmity vs. Amity
*   **Goals:** Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals

A key feature of the CFF is its independent scoring of each dimension's intensity (`_raw` score) and its prominence (`_salience` score). This allows the framework to capture sophisticated communication where opposing appeals may be used simultaneously. From these base scores, several derived metrics are calculated, including Tension Indices, a `Strategic Contradiction Index`, and three composite `Cohesion Indices` (Descriptive, Motivational, and Full).

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on a small (N=4) corpus of political texts. The specific documents were `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`, `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`, `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`, and `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`. The raw data consisted of scores for the 20 base metrics (10 raw, 10 salience) for each document, generated by a prior analytical process.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis was primarily descriptive and correlational. Key statistical methods included the calculation of descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) for all base and derived metrics, and the computation of a Pearson correlation matrix to examine relationships between dimensions.

A significant constraint was the small sample size (N=4), which precludes any meaningful inferential statistical testing or generalization of the findings. All results must be interpreted as preliminary and indicative of patterns that warrant further investigation with a larger dataset. Another constraint was the absence of a `corpus_manifest.json` file, which prevented the planned analysis of rhetorical profiles by speaker. Therefore, the analysis was conducted at the document level only.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An overview of the corpus reveals a wide range of rhetorical expression across all dimensions. The mean scores suggest a slight tendency towards fragmentative rhetoric in this specific sample. For example, the average raw score for `Fear` (M=0.60, SD=0.36) was higher than for `Hope` (M=0.43, SD=0.38). Similarly, `Envy` (M=0.63, SD=0.43) and `Enmity` (M=0.63, SD=0.42) were more prominent on average than their cohesive counterparts, `Compersion` (M=0.23, SD=0.45) and `Amity` (M=0.58, SD=0.40).

The `Full Cohesion Index`, the framework's primary summary metric, showed excellent range and variance (M=-0.11, SD=0.67), with scores spanning from a highly cohesive 0.84 to a highly fragmentative -0.74. This indicates the framework's ability to differentiate documents effectively along the cohesion-fragmentation spectrum. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` was generally low (M=0.05, SD=0.04), but with a notable outlier, suggesting most documents had a coherent rhetorical strategy, with one exception.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived CFF indices provide a higher-level view of rhetorical strategy. The `Full Cohesion Index` and `Strategic Contradiction Index` are particularly insightful when viewed together. Plotting these two metrics reveals a landscape of rhetorical archetypes within the corpus.

**Table 2: Cohesion vs. Contradiction Scores by Document**

| Document Name                                  | Full Cohesion Index | Strategic Contradiction Index | Tentative Archetype          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`              | 0.840               | 0.014                         | Coherently Cohesive          |
| `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`              | -0.735              | 0.044                         | Coherently Fragmentative     |
| `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`   | -0.370              | 0.102                         | Strategically Contradictory  |
| `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt` | -0.175              | 0.036                         | Fragmentative-Leaning        |

The data clearly separates the documents. John McCain's speech is an exemplar of coherent, cohesive rhetoric, with the highest cohesion score and the lowest contradiction. Conversely, Steve King's speech is coherently fragmentative, with a very low cohesion score and a relatively low contradiction score. This indicates a clear, consistent, and divisive messaging strategy. For example, King's rhetoric about threats to the nation's foundation, as when he states, "And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`), aligns with his high `Fragmentative Goals` score (0.80) and contributes to his low overall cohesion.

The most interesting case is the Sanders speech, which exhibits the highest `Strategic Contradiction Index` (0.102). This suggests a complex rhetorical approach that attempts to blend appeals, resulting in a message that is neither purely cohesive nor purely fragmentative, but internally tense.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies within the corpus and provides strong preliminary evidence for the CFF's construct validity.

**Framework Construct Validation:** The oppositional dimensions of the CFF were, as hypothesized, strongly and negatively correlated. This suggests that, in practice, speakers in this corpus made clear choices between opposing appeals.
*   `Compersion_salience` vs. `Tribal_dominance_salience`: r = -1.00 (perfect negative correlation)
*   `Compersion_salience` vs. `Enmity_salience`: r = -0.995
*   `Individual_dignity_salience` vs. `Fear_raw`: r = -0.921

These strong negative correlations indicate that as the intensity of fear-based rhetoric increases, appeals to individual dignity decrease. Similarly, a focus on in-group dominance appears to be rhetorically incompatible with celebrating the success of others.

**Rhetorical Cluster Identification:** The analysis also identified two powerful, internally consistent rhetorical clusters.

1.  **The Fragmentative Cluster:** This strategy links appeals to group dominance with emotions of fear, envy, and enmity, and goals that divide. The correlations are exceptionally high:
    *   `Tribal_dominance_raw` and `Fear_raw`: r = 0.996
    *   `Enmity_raw` and `Envy_raw`: r = 0.982
    *   `Fear_salience` and `Fragmentative_goals_salience`: r = 0.992

    This suggests a meta-strategy where establishing in-group superiority is achieved by stoking fear of external threats and defining fragmentative goals. The rhetoric often focuses on what might be destroyed, as seen in the statement, "And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`), which exemplifies this cluster's focus on division and threat.

2.  **The Cohesive Cluster:** This strategy links appeals to universal human dignity with emotions of amity and goals that unite.
    *   `Cohesive_goals_raw` and `Amity_raw`: r = 0.999
    *   `Individual_dignity_raw` and `Cohesive_goals_raw`: r = 0.868
    *   `Individual_dignity_salience` and `Amity_salience`: r = 0.851

    This indicates a meta-strategy where building common ground (`Amity`) and pursuing shared objectives (`Cohesive Goals`) are rooted in an appeal to the inherent worth of every individual. This is reflected in language that emphasizes universal principles, such as the idea that "being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). Interestingly, this quote comes from a document that is otherwise highly fragmentative, highlighting the utility of the `Strategic Contradiction Index` in capturing such nuances.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns, particularly the two rhetorical clusters, offer significant insight into the practical application of political rhetoric. The fragmentative cluster represents a classic "us vs. them" strategy, where identity is defined through opposition and threat. The cohesive cluster, conversely, represents a strategy of "common ground," where identity is built on shared values and goals.

The strong positive correlation between `Amity` and `Cohesive Goals` (r = 0.999) is particularly noteworthy. It suggests that, in this corpus, rhetoric aimed at fostering friendly relations is almost perfectly aligned with rhetoric that proposes unifying objectives. This connection is exemplified by the statement, "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This quote explicitly frames a cohesive goal (class solidarity) as a form of amity that transcends traditional divisions.

The framework's ability to capture these distinct strategies demonstrates a strong fit with the analyzed corpus. The dimensions are not just abstract concepts; they map to coherent, co-occurring patterns of language. The unexpected finding of a cohesive `Individual Dignity` quote within a highly fragmentative speech (Steve King) underscores the importance of the CFF's multi-dimensional approach. A simple, single-score sentiment analysis would likely miss this complexity, averaging it out into a moderately negative score. The CFF, by contrast, identifies it as a point of rhetorical tension.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) demonstrates considerable effectiveness.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, and particularly the `Full Cohesion Index`, shows high discriminatory power. The standard deviation of the index (0.674) on a scale of -1 to 1 is large, indicating that it effectively spreads the documents across the measurement spectrum, avoiding the common issue of scores clustering in the middle.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The emergence of strong, theoretically-consistent correlational clusters suggests a good fit between the CFF's dimensions and the rhetorical constructs present in the political texts. The dimensions successfully capture meaningful variance in the language used.
*   **Methodological Insight:** The most significant methodological insight is the value of the `Strategic Contradiction Index`. It provides a quantitative measure of rhetorical incoherence or complexity, a feature often discussed qualitatively but rarely measured. This metric allows researchers to move beyond classifying a text as "cohesive" or "fragmentative" and instead ask *how* it might be both simultaneously. For example, the framework can capture appeals to a universal value like the Constitution, as when a speaker says, "We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`), even if the broader context of the speech is fragmentative.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this pilot study, while needing validation on a larger scale, have several important implications. The identification of two opposing rhetorical meta-strategies—one built on dignity, amity, and shared goals, and the other on tribalism, fear, and division—provides a data-driven model for understanding political polarization. This moves beyond simple left/right labels to describe the underlying rhetorical mechanics of unity and division.

The concept of "strategic contradiction" emerges as a key area for future research. The Sanders document, with its high contradiction and moderately low cohesion, represents a fascinating rhetorical archetype. Is this "incoherent" messaging a strategic flaw, or is it a sophisticated attempt to appeal to multiple audiences at once by blending populist anger (a fragmentative trait) with calls for collective action (a cohesive trait)? The CFF provides the tools to begin investigating such questions empirically.

The primary limitation of this study is its sample size of four documents. This prevents any generalization of the findings and means that the extremely high correlation coefficients are likely inflated due to the low degrees of freedom. They are indicative of strong relationships but should not be taken as precise population parameters. The inability to perform speaker-level analysis due to missing metadata also limits the conclusions that can be drawn about individual actors' styles.

Future research should apply the CFF to a large, diachronic corpus of political texts. This would allow for the validation of the rhetorical clusters identified here, a more robust analysis of rhetorical archetypes, and an examination of how these strategies have evolved over time. Researchers may wish to explore whether certain levels of strategic contradiction are more effective for specific political goals, such as mobilization versus persuasion.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, despite its limited scope, successfully demonstrates the analytical utility of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The framework proved effective at discriminating between different types of political discourse, identifying coherent rhetorical strategies, and, most importantly, quantifying the degree of strategic contradiction within a text.

The preliminary findings provide initial support for the CFF's construct validity, with opposing dimensions showing strong negative correlations as hypothesized. The identification of distinct "cohesive" and "fragmentative" rhetorical clusters offers a valuable, data-grounded lens for analyzing political communication. By moving beyond a single sentiment score, the CFF provides a richer, more nuanced picture of how language is used to build or break social cohesion.

The results underscore the potential of sophisticated computational methods to advance the study of political discourse. While all findings must be considered preliminary, they generate a clear and testable set of hypotheses for future research. The CFF appears to be a promising tool for scholars seeking to understand the complex linguistic dynamics shaping our public sphere.
