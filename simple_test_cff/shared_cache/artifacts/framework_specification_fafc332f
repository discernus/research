It moves beyond simple sentiment analysis to reveal sophisticated patterns in how language builds or undermines social solidarity, trust, and constructive civic engagement.\n\n**What problem does it solve?**\nCFF addresses a critical gap in discourse analysis by providing a methodology that preserves complex rhetorical information. Traditional analysis often forces artificial choices (e.g., a text is \"hopeful\" or \"fearful\"), losing nuance when sophisticated communication employs competing appeals simultaneously. CFF's independent scoring of opposing dimensions (e.g., Hope vs. Fear) captures this complexity, enabling a more accurate and insightful analysis of rhetorical strategy.\n\n**Who is it for?**\nThis framework is designed for researchers, policymakers, and civic leaders who need to understand whether discourse contributes to social flourishing or fragmentation. It is applicable to political communication, community health assessment, and media impact evaluation.\n\n### Section 2: Theoretical & Empirical Foundations\n\nThe CFF is grounded in a multi-disciplinary body of research from social psychology, political communication, and conflict resolution theory. Its core innovation\u2014the independent scoring of opposing conceptual anchors\u2014is a direct response to the information loss problem observed in traditional valence-based content analysis.\n\n#### **Social Identity Theory Foundation**\n\nThe framework's identity dimensions (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity) are grounded in Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), which demonstrates how group membership affects intergroup behavior and attitudes. Research shows that in-group favoritism and out-group derogation are fundamental processes in social categorization (Brewer, 1999). The framework's approach to measuring group supremacy rhetoric builds on work by Sidanius & Pratto (1999) on Social Dominance Theory, which explains how societies maintain group-based hierarchies.\n\n**Key Citations**:\n- Tajfel, H., & Turner, J.

(1999). *Social dominance: An intergroup theory of social hierarchy and oppression*. Cambridge University Press.\n\n#### **Political Communication Research**\n\nThe framework's approach to emotional climate analysis (Fear vs. Hope) draws from extensive research on emotional appeals in political discourse. Brader (2006) demonstrated that emotional appeals significantly influence political behavior and decision-making. The framework's emphasis on preserving complex emotional information addresses limitations identified by Marcus et al. (2000) in their Affective Intelligence Theory.\n\nThe relational dimensions (Enmity vs. Amity) are informed by research on political polarization and democratic discourse. Jamieson & Cappella (2008) showed how media discourse patterns can increase political polarization, while Gutmann & Thompson (1996) outlined conditions for constructive democratic deliberation.\n\n**Key Citations**:\n- Brader, T.

(2008). *Echo chamber: Rush Limbaugh and the conservative media establishment*. Oxford University Press.\n- Gutmann, A., & Thompson, D. (1996). *Democracy and disagreement*. Harvard University Press.\n\n#### **Discourse Analysis Methodology**\n\nThe framework's independent scoring approach addresses the \"information loss problem\" identified in traditional valence-based content analysis. Krippendorff (2004) emphasized the importance of preserving analytical complexity rather than forcing artificial binary classifications. The salience-weighting methodology builds on work by van Dijk (2008) on critical discourse analysis, which emphasizes the importance of rhetorical emphasis and structural positioning in meaning construction.\n\n**Key Citations**:\n- Krippendorff, K. (2004). *Content analysis: An introduction to its methodology* (2nd ed.). Sage Publications.\n- van Dijk, T. A. (2008). *Discourse and power*. Palgrave Macmillan.\n\n#### **Empirical Justification for Salience Weighting**\n\nThe use of salience-weighting is empirically grounded in research demonstrating that static, predetermined weights for analytical dimensions lack empirical support. Studies in computational linguistics (Pang & Lee, 2008) and political communication (Laver et al., 2003) have shown that context-dependent weighting based on textual emphasis patterns provides more accurate and reliable results than fixed weighting schemes.\n\n**Key Citations**:\n- Pang, B., & Lee, L.

Extracting policy positions from political texts using words as data. *American Political Science Review*, 97(2), 311-331.\n\n#### **Democratic Health and Social Cohesion**\n\nThe framework's focus on democratic health builds on Putnam's (2000) work on social capital and civic engagement, which demonstrated the relationship between discourse patterns and community cohesion. The normative layers approach draws from deliberative democracy theory (Habermas, 1996), which provides criteria for evaluating the quality of democratic discourse.\n\n**Key Citations**:\n- Putnam, R.

This dual-track analysis reveals not just *what* is being said, but *how much emphasis* it receives.\n-   **Rhetorical Tension**: The framework calculates the strategic tension between opposing pairs to measure the coherence of the discourse. The formula `Tension = min(Score_A, Score_B) \u00d7 |Salience_A - Salience_B|` quantifies contradictions where a speaker employs competing appeals.\n\n**Three Analytical Layers with Normative Transparency**:\n\n| Layer | Focus | Key Questions | Normative Load | Applications |\n|-------|-------|---------------|----------------|--------------|\n| **1 - Pattern Recognition** | Rhetorical strategies | What rhetorical patterns are being used? How sophisticated is the messaging? | **Low** | Academic research, content analysis, baseline measurement |\n| **2 - Motivational Assessment** | Behavioral implications | What behaviors might this inspire? How will audiences likely respond? | **Moderate** | Strategic communication, audience analysis, campaign evaluation |\n| **3 - Social Health Evaluation** | Democratic impact | Does this strengthen or weaken democratic institutions? What are the social consequences? | **High** | Policy evaluation, intervention design, community health monitoring |\n\nEach layer builds on the previous one, adding interpretive depth while maintaining transparency about analytical assumptions. This normative transparency enables appropriate analytical depth selection while maintaining scholarly rigor.\n\n**Derived & Composite Metrics**:\n\n**Tension Indices** (0.0-1.0, higher = more contradiction):\n-   **Identity Tension**: Measures contradiction between tribal dominance and individual dignity appeals\n  - **Formula**: `min(tribal_dominance_score, individual_dignity_score) \u00d7 |tribal_dominance_salience - individual_dignity_salience|`\n-   **Emotional Tension**: Measures contradiction between fear and hope messaging\n  - **Formula**: `min(fear_score, hope_score) \u00d7 |fear_salience - hope_salience|`\n-   **Success Tension**: Measures contradiction between envy and compersion rhetoric\n  - **Formula**: `min(envy_score, compersion_score) \u00d7 |envy_salience - compersion_salience|`\n-   **Relational Tension**: Measures contradiction between enmity and amity positioning\n  - **Formula**: `min(enmity_score, amity_score) \u00d7 |enmity_salience - amity_salience|`\n-   **Goal Tension**: Measures contradiction between fragmentative and cohesive objectives\n  - **Formula**: `min(fragmentative_goals_score, cohesive_goals_score) \u00d7 |fragmentative_goals_salience - cohesive_goals_salience|`\n\n**Strategic Contradiction Index** (0.0-1.0, higher = more incoherent):\n-   **Average of all tension indices** measuring overall rhetorical coherence\n-   **Formula**: `(identity_tension + emotional_tension + success_tension + relational_tension + goal_tension) / 5`\n-   **Low values** indicate consistent, coherent messaging\n-   **High values** indicate strategic contradictions and mixed appeals\n\n**Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices** (-1.0 to +1.0, negative = fragmentative, positive = cohesive):\n\n**Descriptive Cohesion Index**: Measures immediate emotional and relational climate using salience weighting. **Positive values** indicate hope, compersion, and amity emphasis; **negative values** indicate fear, envy, and enmity emphasis.\n\n**Formula**: `(hope_score \u00d7 hope_salience - fear_score \u00d7 fear_salience) + (compersion_score \u00d7 compersion_salience - envy_score \u00d7 envy_salience) + (amity_score \u00d7 amity_salience - enmity_score \u00d7 enmity_salience)` divided by the sum of all salience weights for these dimensions plus epsilon (0.001) to prevent division by zero.\n\n**Motivational Cohesion Index**: Assesses likely behavioral consequences with salience-adjusted emphasis. **Positive values** suggest cooperative, abundance-oriented behaviors; **negative values** suggest competitive, zero-sum behaviors.\n\n**Formula**: `(hope_score \u00d7 hope_salience - fear_score \u00d7 fear_salience) + (compersion_score \u00d7 compersion_salience - envy_score \u00d7 envy_salience) + (amity_score \u00d7 amity_salience - enmity_score \u00d7 enmity_salience) + (cohesive_goals_score \u00d7 cohesive_goals_salience - fragmentative_goals_score \u00d7 fragmentative_goals_salience)` divided by the sum of all salience weights for these dimensions plus epsilon (0.001) to prevent division by zero.\n\n**Full Cohesion Index**: Comprehensive evaluation of democratic health and social cohesion. **Positive values** indicate discourse supporting democratic institutions and social solidarity; **negative values** indicate discourse undermining democratic health and promoting fragmentation.\n\n**Formula**: `(individual_dignity_score \u00d7 individual_dignity_salience - tribal_dominance_score \u00d7 tribal_dominance_salience) + (hope_score \u00d7 hope_salience - fear_score \u00d7 fear_salience) + (compersion_score \u00d7 compersion_salience - envy_score \u00d7 envy_salience) + (amity_score \u00d7 amity_salience - enmity_score \u00d7 enmity_salience) + (cohesive_goals_score \u00d7 cohesive_goals_salience - fragmentative_goals_score \u00d7 fragmentative_goals_salience)` divided by the sum of all salience weights for these dimensions plus epsilon (0.001) to prevent division by zero.\n\n**Calculation Method**: All indices use salience-weighted calculations where each dimension's score is multiplied by its rhetorical prominence (salience), ensuring that what speakers actually emphasize receives appropriate influence on the final measurement. The normalization by total salience weights ensures indices remain within the -1.0 to +1.0 range while reflecting the relative emphasis patterns in the discourse.\n\n### Section 4: Intended Application & Corpus Fit\n\n-   **Target Corpus Description**: CFF is designed for the analysis of persuasive or strategic communication, particularly in the political and social spheres. This includes political speeches, campaign materials, policy documents, and organizational communications.\n-   **Known Limitations & Scope**: The framework is less suited for analyzing purely informational, conversational, or fictional texts. The complexity of the salience and tension assessments requires a text with sufficient length and rhetorical structure to be meaningful.\n-   **Model Requirements**: This framework requires a highly capable LLM model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4) for reliable analysis. The sophisticated dual-track analysis (intensity + salience), complex concept distinctions, and mathematical framework exceed the capabilities of basic or lightweight models.\n-   **System Validation Note**: Be aware that the Discernus platform will perform a post-hoc statistical analysis of your framework's fit with your chosen corpus based on the variance in the results. A low framework-corpus fit score may indicate that the framework was misapplied and could impact the interpretation of the results.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: The Machine-Readable Appendix\n\n```yaml\n# --- Start of Machine-Readable Appendix ---\n\n# 5.1: Metadata\nmetadata:\n  framework_name: \"cohesive_flourishing_framework\"\n  framework_version: \"10.2\"\n  author: \"Discernus Project\"\n  date: \"2025-08-20\"\n  spec_version: \"10.0\"\n\n# 5.2: Analysis Variants\nanalysis_variants:\n  default:\n    description: \"Complete v10.0 implementation with salience and tension analysis.\"\n    analysis_prompt: |\n      You are an expert discourse analyst specializing in social cohesion and democratic health, grounded in political psychology and social identity theory.
