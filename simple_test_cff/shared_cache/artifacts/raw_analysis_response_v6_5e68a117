    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with a strong, clear rhetorical structure. The central theme is a class-based conflict, framing 'working people' against 'oligarchs'. This allows for high scores on seemingly contradictory dimensions like Tribal Dominance (class-based us-vs-them), Individual Dignity (call for universal dignity within the 'us' group), Enmity (towards the 'them' group), and Amity (within the 'us' group). The rhetoric is consistent, making confidence in scoring high."
