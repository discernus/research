    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with strong populist and class-based rhetoric. This makes it an excellent fit for the Cohesive Flourishing Framework. The analysis focused on distinguishing between the 'in-group' (working people, the audience) and the 'out-group' (oligarchs, billionaires, specific political opponents). The rhetoric is characterized by high Enmity and Envy towards the out-group, coupled with calls for Amity and solidarity within the in-group as a means to achieve Fragmentative Goals (defeating opponents)."
