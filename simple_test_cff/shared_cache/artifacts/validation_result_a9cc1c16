    "In experiment 'simple_test', the human-readable research question in the narrative section ('What are the baseline cohesion and tension scores for the documents in the sample corpus?') differs from the machine-readable research question in the YAML appendix ('Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion than populist styles?').",
    "The corpus contains only 4 documents. According to platform standards, this sample size is too small for robust statistical significance testing and limits the generalizability of findings."
