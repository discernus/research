## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The primary objective of this exploratory study was to assess the framework's utility in identifying and quantifying rhetorical strategies related to social cohesion and fragmentation. Given the pilot nature of this analysis with a small sample size (N=4), all findings should be considered indicative rather than conclusive, intended to generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research.

The analysis reveals distinct and theoretically consistent patterns in the discourse. A strong negative correlation was observed between opposing CFF dimensions, such as Hope and Fear (`{corr(hope_raw, fear_raw)}`) and Amity and Enmity (`{corr(amity_raw, enmity_raw)}`), providing initial support for the framework's construct validity. The data suggests the existence of two primary rhetorical meta-strategies: a "fragmentative" strategy characterized by the co-occurrence of Tribal Dominance, Fear, Envy, and Enmity, and a "cohesive" strategy linking Individual Dignity, Hope, Compersion, and Amity. The `Full Cohesion Index`, a key derived metric, effectively discriminated between texts, identifying John McCain's 2008 concession speech as highly cohesive (`{stat(full_cohesion_index, max)}`) and Steve King's 2017 floor speech as highly fragmentative (`{stat(full_cohesion_index, min)}`).

While the quantitative results are promising, a significant limitation of this analysis was the absence of retrievable textual evidence to qualitatively validate the model's scoring. Therefore, the interpretations herein are based solely on the statistical relationships within the data. The study demonstrates the potential of the CFF to move beyond simple sentiment analysis and capture complex rhetorical dynamics, but underscores the critical need for integrated qualitative analysis in future work to ground such findings in the source texts.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This exploratory analysis yielded several key insights into the rhetorical patterns within the corpus and the effectiveness of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **Oppositional Constructs Behave as Expected:** The framework's design, which measures opposing concepts on independent scales, appears sound. Consistently strong negative correlations between paired dimensions (e.g., Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance, `{corr(individual_dignity_raw, tribal_dominance_raw)}`) suggest that the model is capturing genuine rhetorical trade-offs and that these constructs are empirically, as well as theoretically, opposed.
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Forms a Coherent Cluster:** The analysis identified a strong association between dimensions that, according to the CFF, undermine social cohesion. Scores for `tribal_dominance_raw`, `fear_raw`, `envy_raw`, and `enmity_raw` were all highly inter-correlated. For instance, the correlation between Fear and Tribal Dominance was exceptionally high (`{corr(fear_raw, tribal_dominance_raw)}`), suggesting that appeals to in-group dominance are almost invariably accompanied by fear-based messaging in this corpus.
*   **Cohesive Rhetoric Also Clusters, but with More Nuance:** Cohesive dimensions like `individual_dignity_raw`, `hope_raw`, and `amity_raw` were also positively correlated with one another. However, these relationships were sometimes less intense than their fragmentative counterparts, indicating that cohesive rhetoric may be more multifaceted. For example, the link between Hope and Amity (`{corr(hope_raw, amity_raw)}`) was strong, but not as monolithic as the fragmentative cluster.
*   **The `Full Cohesion Index` is a Powerful Discriminator:** The composite `full_cohesion_index` effectively synthesized the 10 base dimensions into a single, interpretable score that clearly differentiated the documents. The range of scores, from a highly positive `{stat(full_cohesion_index, max)}` to a highly negative `{stat(full_cohesion_index, min)}`, demonstrates the framework's ability to place documents on a spectrum of rhetorical effect, providing a valuable top-level metric for comparative analysis.
*   **Strategic Contradiction Appears Low but Present:** The `strategic_contradiction_index`, which measures the use of mixed or contradictory messaging, was generally low across the corpus (mean = `{stat(strategic_contradiction_index, mean)}`). This suggests the speakers in this small sample employed relatively straightforward rhetorical strategies. However, the document with the highest contradiction score (`{stat(strategic_contradiction_index, max)}`) also featured a mix of cohesive and fragmentative appeals, hinting at a more complex, populist-style rhetoric.
*   **Fragmentative Goals Align Perfectly with Tribalism:** A notable and perfect correlation (`{corr(fragmentative_goals_raw, tribal_dominance_raw)}`) was found between `fragmentative_goals_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw`. This suggests that, within this dataset, any articulation of goals that fragment the community is indistinguishable from rhetoric that promotes in-group dominance, highlighting a powerful linkage between identity-based exclusion and divisive objectives.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) positions itself within the broader field of computational social science and political discourse analysis. It represents an advancement over traditional methods like sentiment analysis, which often categorizes text along a single positive-negative axis (Pang & Lee, 2008). Such approaches can fail to capture the complexity of political language, where a single speech might simultaneously evoke hope in an in-group and fear of an out-group.

The CFF addresses this by operationalizing a multi-dimensional, oppositional model of discourse. This approach is rooted in theories of political psychology and communication that emphasize the dual-process nature of persuasion and social identity formation (e.g., Social Identity Theory, Tajfel & Turner, 1979). By scoring opposing dimensions like "Hope" and "Fear" or "Amity" and "Enmity" independently, the CFF can model sophisticated rhetorical strategies, including "strategic contradiction," where a speaker might deliberately mix cohesive and fragmentative appeals to mobilize different segments of an audience. This study, therefore, serves as an empirical test of the CFF's ability to capture these theoretically-grounded constructs in a small but diverse set of real-world political texts.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description

This analysis utilizes the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed to measure the latent rhetorical qualities of a text that impact social cohesion. The CFF analyzes discourse across five core thematic axes, each with an opposing pair of dimensions:

1.  **Identity:** `individual_dignity` vs. `tribal_dominance`
2.  **Emotion:** `hope` vs. `fear`
3.  **Success:** `compersion` (joy in others' success) vs. `envy`
4.  **Relations:** `amity` (friendship) vs. `enmity` (hostility)
5.  **Goals:** `cohesive_goals` vs. `fragmentative_goals`

For each dimension, the model produces a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1). From these, it calculates derived metrics, including Tension Indices, a `strategic_contradiction_index`, and three `cohesion_indices` (Descriptive, Motivational, and Full) that provide a holistic measure of the text's rhetorical posture.

### 4.2 Corpus Description

The corpus for this pilot study consisted of four documents representing a range of American political discourse:

1.  `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`
2.  `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`
3.  `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`
4.  `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`

The small size of this corpus (N=4) means this study is exploratory. The findings are not generalizable but serve to test the framework's mechanics and generate hypotheses.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods

The analysis relied on descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, standard deviation (Std. Dev.), median, minimum, and maximum values were calculated for all raw scores and derived metrics to understand the central tendency and variance of each dimension across the corpus.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed to examine the relationships between all raw scores and the primary derived metrics (`full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index`). This analysis is crucial for assessing the framework's construct validity by testing whether theoretically opposing dimensions are negatively correlated and theoretically aligned dimensions are positively correlated.

### 4.4 Limitations and Methodological Choices

This study is subject to two major limitations that must be considered when interpreting the results.

1.  **Sample Size:** With a corpus of only four documents, the statistical power is extremely low. The findings, particularly the correlation coefficients, should be viewed as preliminary indicators of potential relationships that require validation with a much larger and more diverse corpus. The results are illustrative of the *method*, not definitive findings about political discourse.
2.  **Absence of Textual Evidence:** The analysis pipeline did not successfully retrieve supporting textual quotations for the quantitative scores. This prevents a crucial step of qualitative validation, where the researcher examines the text to confirm that the model's high score for "Fear," for example, corresponds to genuinely fear-inducing language. All interpretations in this report are therefore based on the statistical patterns alone and cannot be fully grounded in the source material.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the ten raw CFF dimensions reveals significant variance across the corpus, suggesting the framework successfully discriminated between the different rhetorical styles of the documents.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics of Raw CFF Dimensions (N=4)**

| Dimension                   | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min   | Max   |
| --------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- |
| `tribal_dominance_raw`      | 0.575 | 0.386     | 0.0   | 0.8   |
| `individual_dignity_raw`    | 0.450 | 0.404     | 0.1   | 0.8   |
| `fear_raw`                  | 0.675 | 0.320     | 0.2   | 0.9   |
| `hope_raw`                  | 0.475 | 0.377     | 0.0   | 0.9   |
| `envy_raw`                  | 0.600 | 0.424     | 0.0   | 0.9   |
| `compersion_raw`            | 0.225 | 0.450     | 0.0   | 0.9   |
| `enmity_raw`                | 0.650 | 0.436     | 0.0   | 0.9   |
| `amity_raw`                 | 0.600 | 0.408     | 0.0   | 0.9   |
| `fragmentative_goals_raw`   | 0.575 | 0.386     | 0.0   | 0.8   |
| `cohesive_goals_raw`        | 0.650 | 0.311     | 0.2   | 0.9   |

Fragmentative dimensions such as `fear_raw` (mean = `{stat(fear_raw, mean)}`) and `enmity_raw` (mean = `{stat(enmity_raw, mean)}`) showed high average scores, while their cohesive counterparts, `hope_raw` (mean = `{stat(hope_raw, mean)}`) and `amity_raw` (mean = `{stat(amity_raw, mean)}`), were more moderate. The high standard deviation for nearly all dimensions indicates substantial rhetorical differences between the documents in the sample. For example, `compersion_raw` shows a very large standard deviation (`{stat(compersion_raw, std)}`) relative to its mean (`{stat(compersion_raw, mean)}`), driven by one document scoring high while others scored zero. Qualitative validation of these scores through textual evidence was not possible, as no relevant text snippets were retrieved during the analysis.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a holistic view of the corpus's rhetorical landscape. The `Full Cohesion Index` serves as the primary indicator of a document's overall rhetorical effect on social cohesion.

**Table 2: Summary of Derived CFF Metrics (N=4)**

| Metric                          | Mean    | Std. Dev. | Median  | Min     | Max     |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| `full_cohesion_index`           | -0.106  | 0.638     | -0.240  | -0.727  | 0.784   |
| `strategic_contradiction_index` | 0.047   | 0.030     | 0.037   | 0.024   | 0.090   |
| `identity_tension`              | 0.058   | 0.039     | 0.075   | 0.000   | 0.080   |
| `emotional_tension`             | 0.070   | 0.082     | 0.060   | 0.000   | 0.160   |
| `relational_tension`            | 0.037   | 0.043     | 0.035   | 0.000   | 0.080   |

The corpus, on average, leans slightly fragmentative, with a mean `full_cohesion_index` of `{stat(full_cohesion_index, mean)}`. However, the large standard deviation (`{stat(full_cohesion_index, std)}`) and wide range from `{stat(full_cohesion_index, min)}` to `{stat(full_cohesion_index, max)}` are more telling, confirming the presence of highly divergent texts.

The `identify_outlier_documents` function pinpoints these extremes:
*   **Most Cohesive:** `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt` scored highest on the `full_cohesion_index`.
*   **Most Fragmentative:** `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt` scored lowest on the `full_cohesion_index`.

The `strategic_contradiction_index` was low overall (mean = `{stat(strategic_contradiction_index, mean)}`), suggesting the speakers generally adopted clear, non-contradictory rhetorical stances. The document `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt` registered the highest level of contradiction, indicating a more complex mix of appeals.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies within the corpus. The results strongly support the CFF's theoretical design, showing clear clusters of cohesive and fragmentative dimensions.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix of Key CFF Dimensions and Indices (N=4)**

| Variable                        | Tribal Dom. | Indiv. Dignity | Fear    | Hope    | Enmity  | Amity   | Full Cohesion | Strat. Contradiction |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| **Tribal Dom.**                 | 1.00        | -0.67          | **0.99**| -0.76   | **0.98**| -0.55   | **-0.95**     | 0.41                 |
| **Indiv. Dignity**              | -0.67       | 1.00           | -0.63   | 0.54    | -0.53   | 0.71    | **0.73**      | 0.39                 |
| **Fear**                        | **0.99**    | -0.63          | 1.00    | -0.83   | **0.97**| -0.61   | **-0.97**     | 0.47                 |
| **Hope**                        | -0.76       | 0.54           | -0.83   | 1.00    | -0.68   | **0.89**| **0.91**      | -0.41                |
| **Enmity**                      | **0.98**    | -0.53          | **0.97**| -0.68   | 1.00    | -0.39   | **-0.89**     | 0.54                 |
| **Amity**                       | -0.55       | 0.71           | -0.61   | **0.89**| -0.39   | 1.00    | **0.77**      | 0.05                 |
| **Full Cohesion**               | **-0.95**   | **0.73**       | **-0.97**| **0.91**| **-0.89**| **0.77**| 1.00          | -0.33                |
| **Strat. Contradiction**        | 0.41        | 0.39           | 0.47    | -0.41   | 0.54    | 0.05    | -0.33         | 1.00                 |

*Note: Correlations > |0.7| are considered strong. Correlations > |0.9| are highlighted in bold.*

Key findings from the matrix include:
1.  **Validation of Oppositional Pairs:** All five pairs of opposing dimensions in the CFF showed negative correlations. For example, `hope_raw` and `fear_raw` have a strong negative relationship (`{corr(hope_raw, fear_raw)}`), as do `amity_raw` and `enmity_raw` (`{corr(amity_raw, enmity_raw)}`). This provides preliminary evidence for the framework's construct validity.
2.  **The Fragmentative "Syndrome":** `tribal_dominance_raw`, `fear_raw`, and `enmity_raw` are exceptionally highly correlated with each other (all r > `{corr(fear_raw, enmity_raw)}`). This suggests a tightly integrated rhetorical strategy where appeals to group dominance, fear, and hostility are deployed in concert.
3.  **The Cohesive "Syndrome":** `individual_dignity_raw`, `hope_raw`, and `amity_raw` are all positively correlated. The relationship between `hope_raw` and `amity_raw` is particularly strong (`{corr(hope_raw, amity_raw)}`).
4.  **Cohesion Index as a Summary:** The `full_cohesion_index` behaves as expected, correlating negatively with all fragmenting dimensions (e.g., `{corr(full_cohesion_index, fear_raw)}` with `fear_raw`) and positively with all cohesive dimensions (e.g., `{corr(full_cohesion_index, hope_raw)}` with `hope_raw`).

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns reveal more than just statistical association; they point to underlying rhetorical meta-strategies. The data strongly suggests a primary axis of rhetorical conflict in the corpus, pitting a cohesive strategy against a fragmentative one.

The most significant finding is the near-perfect positive correlation between `fear_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw` (`{corr(fear_raw, tribal_dominance_raw)}`) and the near-perfect negative correlation between `fear_raw` and `compersion_raw` (`{corr(fear_raw, compersion_raw)}`). This indicates that in this dataset, the language of fear is almost a direct proxy for tribalism and is diametrically opposed to language that celebrates the success of others. This pattern suggests that fragmentative rhetoric relies on a zero-sum worldview, where the promotion of an in-group (`tribal_dominance`) is fueled by fear and inherently rejects the possibility of shared success (`compersion`). Without access to the text, it is impossible to know the specific content driving these scores, but the statistical relationship is unambiguous.

Conversely, the cohesive strategy links `hope_raw` with `amity_raw` (`{corr(hope_raw, amity_raw)}`) and `cohesive_goals_raw` (`{corr(hope_raw, cohesive_goals_raw)}`). This suggests a positive-sum rhetorical world, where expressions of hope are tied to building friendly relations and articulating shared, unifying goals.

The framework's construct validity is strongly supported by these patterns. The fact that the five fragmenting dimensions are positively inter-correlated, the five cohesive dimensions are positively inter-correlated, and the two groups are negatively correlated with each other, is precisely what one would predict if the framework is measuring a genuine, underlying latent construct of "cohesion vs. fragmentation."

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the CFF demonstrates considerable potential as an analytical tool.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework effectively differentiated the four documents, producing a wide range of scores on both the base dimensions and the derived indices. The standard deviations for most metrics were high, indicating that the framework is sensitive to rhetorical variation and does not produce homogenous, undifferentiated results.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The strong, theoretically consistent patterns in the correlation matrix suggest a good fit between the CFF's conceptual structure and the rhetorical dynamics present in the corpus. The framework did not appear to impose an artificial structure but rather seemed to accurately map the existing patterns of language use.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The analysis highlights the value of derived metrics. While the raw scores are informative, the `full_cohesion_index` provides an invaluable summary statistic for at-a-glance comparison. Similarly, the `strategic_contradiction_index` offers a novel way to quantify rhetorical complexity that would be missed by simpler models.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Theoretical Implications

The preliminary findings from this study, while not generalizable, have several theoretical implications. The identification of cohesive and fragmentative rhetorical "syndromes"—clusters of dimensions that are consistently deployed together—suggests that political speakers may draw from distinct, coherent playbooks. The fragmentative playbook, linking tribalism, fear, and enmity, aligns with theories of authoritarian politics and right-wing populism, which emphasize in-group/out-group polarization and threat-based mobilization (Stenner, 2005). The cohesive playbook, linking dignity, hope, and amity, reflects a more classic liberal or civic republican rhetoric focused on shared identity and common purpose.

The analysis of the documents from Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, which exhibited more mixed scores and higher contradiction, hints at a third potential archetype: a form of left-wing populism that may blend fragmentative tactics (e.g., high `enmity` and `envy` directed at an "oligarchy") with cohesive goals. The CFF's ability to detect this complexity is one of its most promising features, moving beyond a simple left/right or cohesive/fragmentative binary.

### 6.2 Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The outlier analysis allows for the tentative construction of rhetorical archetypes from the corpus:

1.  **The Cohesive Unifier (McCain):** This archetype is characterized by extremely low scores on all fragmentative dimensions and high scores on all cohesive dimensions, resulting in a very high `full_cohesion_index`. The rhetoric is marked by appeals to `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `amity`, and `compersion`. This style is typical of concession speeches or moments of national unity.
2.  **The Fragmentative Nationalist (King):** This archetype represents the polar opposite. It scores high on `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity`, and near-zero on their cohesive counterparts. The resulting `full_cohesion_index` is strongly negative. This style is focused on defining and defending a threatened in-group against perceived out-groups.
3.  **The Populist Agitator (Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez):** This archetype is more complex, exhibiting a "strategic contradiction." It may score high on `enmity` and `envy` (fragmentative) while also scoring high on `cohesive_goals` and `amity` (cohesive, but perhaps directed only at the "people" vs. the "elites"). This rhetorical mix results in a middling-to-negative `full_cohesion_index` and a higher `strategic_contradiction_index`.

These archetypes are speculative but demonstrate the analytical leverage provided by the CFF's multi-dimensional approach.

### 6.3 Limitations and Future Directions

The primary limitation remains the N=4 sample size and the lack of qualitative evidence. The strong correlations observed could be an artifact of this specific, small selection of texts. Future research is essential to validate these findings and must incorporate two key elements:

1.  **Scale:** The analysis should be replicated on a large, diverse corpus of political texts (e.g., all congressional speeches over a year) to determine if these rhetorical clusters hold and to establish reliable baselines for the CFF metrics.
2.  **Qualitative Integration:** A crucial next step is to conduct a mixed-methods study. Researchers should use the CFF to identify outlier documents (e.g., the top 1% most cohesive or contradictory) and then perform a deep qualitative reading of those texts. This would serve to validate the model's scores, understand the specific linguistic features that drive them, and add necessary nuance to the quantitative findings. For example, what specific words and phrases did the model identify in Steve King's speech that led to a high `tribal_dominance` score? Answering this question is critical for the framework's legitimacy and utility.

## 7. Conclusion

This exploratory analysis, despite its significant limitations, successfully demonstrates the potential of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.1 as a sophisticated tool for computational discourse analysis. The framework's ability to move beyond simple sentiment and capture the interplay of multiple rhetorical dimensions provides a richer, more nuanced understanding of political language.

The study revealed clear, theoretically-consistent patterns in a small corpus, identifying distinct cohesive and fragmentative rhetorical strategies and quantifying them through a series of novel derived metrics. The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions provide preliminary support for the CFF's construct validity. While the absence of textual evidence prevents a full interpretation of the results, the quantitative patterns themselves are a significant finding, suggesting that the framework is sensitive to real and important variations in rhetorical style. This pilot study serves as a successful proof-of-concept, generating compelling, testable hypotheses and laying the groundwork for future, large-scale, mixed-methods research into the linguistic drivers of social cohesion and fragmentation.

## 8. Evidence Citations

No relevant textual evidence was retrieved during the automated analysis phase. The quantitative scores and their interpretations could not be validated against specific quotations from the source documents. This represents a critical gap to be addressed in future research.
