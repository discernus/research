The rhetorical strategy is consistent and pronounced, involving the clear definition of an 'in-group' (the American people/working class) and an 'out-group' (the billionaire class/oligarchs). This made scoring dimensions related to conflict, such as Tribal Dominance, Envy, and Enmity, straightforward. The speech also employs a classic problem/solution structure, establishing a crisis (Fear) and then offering a unifying path forward (Hope, Amity, Cohesive Goals), leading to significant scores in these opposing dimensions. The salience scores often reflect the structural importance of a theme (e.g., Hope as a concluding call to action) even if its overall intensity throughout the text is moderate.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribal_dominance\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"individual_dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"envy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"compersion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"enmity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"amity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"fragmentative_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"cohesive_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribal_dominance\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people.
