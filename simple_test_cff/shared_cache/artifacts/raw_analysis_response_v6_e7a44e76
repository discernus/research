    "analysis_notes": "The document is a highly polemical political speech with two distinct but thematically linked sections: the constitutional role of the judiciary and the perceived crisis of illegal immigration. The rhetoric is stark and emotionally charged, making the identification of dimensions relatively straightforward. The primary challenge was distinguishing between policy disagreement and the specific dimensional definitions (e.g., 'enmity' vs. simple opposition). The analysis focused on the rhetorical strategies used to frame these issues."
