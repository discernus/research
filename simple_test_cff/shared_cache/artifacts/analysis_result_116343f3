The speech has a very strong and clear rhetorical profile, characterized by high levels of fear, enmity, and tribalism, with almost no presence of the opposing dimensions like hope, amity, or individual dignity. The evidence for the dominant themes is explicit and repeated, leading to high confidence in the scoring. The salience scores reflect that the speech's central purpose revolves around creating an in-group/out-group dynamic based on legal status and perceived constitutional loyalty, and using fear-based narratives to justify fragmentative policy goals.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribal_dominance\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.85,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"individual_dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.95,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"envy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.2,\n          \"salience\": 0.2,\n          \"confidence\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"compersion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"enmity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"amity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.2,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"fragmentative_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"cohesive_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribal_dominance\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"That's 135 dead Americans that would be alive today if the President didn't have the policy of releasing criminal, criminal aliens onto the streets.\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"in-group/out-group framing\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"individual_dignity\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"absence of evidence\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"fear\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body.\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"existential threat narrative\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"hope\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"absence of evidence\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"envy\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"And now the edict that we grant this de facto permit, this amnesty for the parents of, of anchor babies to be staying free in the United States, that suspends the rule of law...\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"context_type\": \"grievance over unearned benefits\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"compersion\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"absence of evidence\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"enmity\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that the Constitution means what they want it to mean...\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"adversarial political positioning\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"amity\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"we here who take an oath to support and defend the Constitution\u2014and that's actually all of us here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, and everyone in the United States Senate for that matter\u2014we recognize that if we're going to support and defend the Constitution...\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"context_type\": \"in-group solidarity appeal\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"fragmentative_goals\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"And when they're done, send them back to the country that they can live in legally for the rest of their lives if they don't stay in our prisons for the rest of their lives.\",\n          \"confidence\": 1.0,\n          \"context_type\": \"zero-sum policy objective\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"cohesive_goals\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"Secure our borders.
