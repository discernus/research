    "analysis_notes": "The analyzed document is a highly adversarial political speech. The speaker's rhetoric is grounded in constitutional grievance and emotionally charged narratives of victimhood, making dimensions like Fear, Enmity, and Tribal Dominance exceptionally prominent. Conversely, dimensions related to cooperation, hope, or universal dignity are entirely absent. The distinction between intensity (the power of the specific examples) and salience (the overall rhetorical focus) is key to this analysis."
