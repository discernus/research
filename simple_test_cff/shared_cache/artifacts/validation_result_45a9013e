    "The experiment configuration specifies `framework: \"cff_v10.md\"`, but the provided framework document is titled \"Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1\" and its machine-readable metadata specifies version \"10.2\". The system will be unable to locate the specified framework file.",
    "The research question in the experiment's human-readable abstract (\"What are the baseline cohesion and tension scores...\") is different from the machine-readable research question (\"Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion than populist styles?\"). This creates ambiguity about the experiment's primary goal.",
    "The corpus contains only four documents (N=4). Per platform guidelines, this sample size is insufficient for statistical analysis and limits the experiment to a comparative case study. Findings cannot be generalized.",
    "The framework document has inconsistent versioning. The human-readable title is \"v10.1\", while the `framework_version` in the machine-readable YAML appendix is \"10.2\"."
