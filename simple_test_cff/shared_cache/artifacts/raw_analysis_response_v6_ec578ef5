    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic political concession speech, a genre characterized by calls for unity and graceful acceptance of defeat. This rhetorical context heavily influences the scoring, leading to high scores on cohesive dimensions (Amity, Hope, Compersion, Cohesive Goals, Individual Dignity) and very low scores on fragmentative dimensions (Enmity, Fear, Envy, Fragmentative Goals, Tribal Dominance). The analysis focuses on the explicit rhetorical strategies employed to bridge divides after a contentious election."
