    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political concession speech, a genre characterized by specific rhetorical goals: conceding defeat, promoting national unity, and gracefully exiting the contest. The analysis reflects this context. The speaker, John McCain, very clearly and deliberately emphasizes themes of unity, respect for the victor, and hope for the country, while actively suppressing themes of division, resentment, or fear. This results in a highly polarized set of scores, with cohesive dimensions being strong and salient, and fragmentative dimensions being absent. The evidence is abundant and explicit for the scored dimensions."
