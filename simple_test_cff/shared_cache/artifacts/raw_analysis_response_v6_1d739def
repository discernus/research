    "analysis_notes": "The document is a strong example of populist, class-based political rhetoric. It clearly defines an in-group ('working people') and an out-group ('oligarchs'), resulting in high scores in dimensions like Enmity, Fear, and Tribal Dominance. Countervailing themes such as Individual Dignity and Amity are also present, but they are framed as virtues for the in-group's internal solidarity. The dimension of Compersion is notably absent, creating a stark contrast with the high score in Envy."
