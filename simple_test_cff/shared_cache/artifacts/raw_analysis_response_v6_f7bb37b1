    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic political concession speech, characterized by graciousness towards the victor and calls for national unity. This leads to high scores in the cohesive dimensions (Individual Dignity, Hope, Compersion, Amity, Cohesive Goals) and near-zero scores in the fragmentative dimensions (Tribal Dominance, Fear, Envy, Enmity, Fragmentative Goals). The rhetoric is explicit and not difficult to interpret."
