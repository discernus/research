## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of a small corpus (N=4) of political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis sought to map the rhetorical strategies within the documents and assess their potential impact on social cohesion. Despite the significant limitation of the small sample size, the findings are indicative of pronounced rhetorical patterns that warrant further investigation. The results reveal a stark polarization within the corpus, with documents occupying opposite ends of the cohesion spectrum. One document, John McCain's 2008 concession speech, scored exceptionally high on the `full_cohesion_index` (0.84), while another, a 2017 speech by Steve King, scored exceptionally low (-0.74).

The analysis of inter-dimensional correlations suggests the presence of two distinct and oppositional meta-strategies. A "cohesive" strategy, characterized by appeals to `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals`, was found to be strongly negatively correlated with a "fragmentative" strategy employing `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, and `fragmentative_goals`. This strong oppositional structure provides preliminary support for the CFF's construct validity. Furthermore, derived metrics like the `strategic_contradiction_index` proved effective in identifying rhetorically complex texts. For instance, a speech by Bernie Sanders registered the highest contradiction score (0.102), indicating a sophisticated blend of cohesive and fragmentative appeals that a simple sentiment score would miss.

The framework demonstrated strong discriminatory power, effectively differentiating the rhetorical styles within this limited sample. However, the analysis was constrained by the small corpus size and the absence of a corpus manifest, which prevented a planned analysis of rhetorical profiles by speaker. All findings should be considered preliminary and exploratory, serving primarily to generate hypotheses for testing on a larger, more representative dataset. The study underscores the potential of the CFF to move beyond simplistic discourse analysis and capture the nuanced, often contradictory, ways language shapes social dynamics.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Extreme Rhetorical Polarization:** The corpus is defined by a stark divide. The `full_cohesion_index` scores range from highly cohesive (0.84 for McCain) to highly fragmentative (-0.74 for King), suggesting the documents represent fundamentally different approaches to political communication. The large standard deviations across most raw scores confirm this high variance.
*   **Two Opposing Rhetorical "Meta-Strategies":** Correlation analysis reveals two tightly clustered and mutually exclusive sets of rhetorical appeals. Cohesive dimensions like `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` are almost perfectly correlated (r = 0.999), while being strongly negatively correlated with fragmentative dimensions like `tribal_dominance_raw` (r = -0.73). This suggests speakers in this corpus draw from one of two distinct playbooks, rather than mixing and matching appeals randomly.
*   **Validation of CFF's Oppositional Design:** The framework's core assumption—that dimensions like Hope and Fear are opposing but independent constructs—is supported by the data. Across all five dimensional pairs, the cohesive element is strongly and negatively correlated with its fragmentative counterpart. For example, `tribal_dominance_salience` and `compersion_salience` have a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00), indicating they are used in a mutually exclusive manner in this corpus.
*   **Strategic Contradiction as a Key Rhetorical Device:** The `strategic_contradiction_index` successfully identified nuanced messaging. A speech by Bernie Sanders, while leaning fragmentative (`full_cohesion_index` = -0.37), exhibited the highest level of contradiction (0.102). This indicates a complex strategy that simultaneously leverages high-intensity opposing appeals (e.g., `enmity` and `amity`), a feature that traditional analysis methods would likely obscure.
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric is Tightly Integrated:** The dimensions associated with social fragmentation show exceptionally high inter-correlation. For instance, the raw scores for `tribal_dominance` and `fear` are almost perfectly correlated (r = 0.996), as are `enmity` and `tribal_dominance` (r = 0.965). This suggests that in this corpus, fragmentative rhetoric is a highly coherent and integrated strategy where appeals to in-group dominance, fear of the other, and enmity are deployed as a single, powerful package.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a multi-dimensional analytical tool designed to assess the impact of political and social discourse on community cohesion. As outlined in its specification, the CFF moves beyond simple sentiment analysis by independently scoring texts across ten core dimensions arranged in five oppositional pairs:
*   **Identity:** `individual_dignity` vs. `tribal_dominance`
*   **Emotion:** `hope` vs. `fear`
*   **Success:** `compersion` (joy in others' success) vs. `envy`
*   **Relation:** `amity` vs. `enmity`
*   **Goals:** `cohesive_goals` vs. `fragmentative_goals`

For each dimension, the analysis produces a `raw` score (intensity of the appeal, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence of the appeal, 0-1). This dual-scoring system allows the CFF to capture sophisticated rhetoric where competing appeals may be present simultaneously but with differing emphasis. From these base scores, several derived metrics are calculated, including five `tension_indices` (measuring the simultaneous use of opposing appeals), a `strategic_contradiction_index` (the average of the tension indices), and three composite `cohesion_indices` that provide an overall measure of a document's rhetorical posture.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on a small corpus of four political texts. The raw data for each document consists of 20 primary scores (a raw and salience score for each of the 10 dimensions) and associated confidence metrics from the language model. The statistical analysis pipeline then computed nine derived metrics for each document, including the tension, contradiction, and cohesion indices.

The identity of the documents suggests a focus on American political speech, including John McCain's 2008 concession, a 2017 House floor speech by Steve King, and two 2025-dated speeches on "fighting oligarchy" attributed to Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The specific content of these documents was not directly analyzed; this report relies solely on the quantitative output of the CFF analysis.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis was primarily descriptive and correlational, which is appropriate for a pilot study with a very small sample size (N=4). The primary statistical methods included:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all raw, salience, and derived metrics to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus.
2.  **Pearson Correlation:** Calculation of a correlation matrix for all raw and salience scores to identify relationships between rhetorical dimensions and uncover underlying strategic patterns.

**Significant Limitations:**
*   **Sample Size:** With N=4, the study is exploratory. The findings are indicative of patterns within this specific micro-corpus but cannot be generalized. Statistical significance testing is not meaningful, and all results must be interpreted with extreme caution. The primary value of this analysis is in hypothesis generation and assessing the framework's potential.
*   **Missing Corpus Manifest:** The analysis function `analyze_rhetorical_profiles_by_speaker` was skipped because the required `corpus_manifest.json` file was not found. This prevented a planned comparison of rhetorical styles between the different speakers, a key objective for this type of analysis.
*   **Lack of Textual Evidence:** While the prompt provided a small, curated set of textual evidence, a full analysis would typically require dynamic access to the source texts to deeply contextualize every statistical finding. The interpretations herein are constrained by the limited number of provided quotes.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An analysis of the descriptive statistics for the corpus reveals a dataset characterized by high variance and polarization. The mean scores often fall mid-range, but the large standard deviations across nearly all dimensions indicate that these means are the product of averaging highly divergent scores, rather than a tendency toward moderate rhetoric.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Raw and Salience Scores (N=4)**

| `fear_salience`               | 0.650 | 0.370     | 0.10  | 0.63  | 0.80  | 0.83  | 0.90  |
| `hope_salience`               | 0.450 | 0.351     | 0.10  | 0.18  | 0.45  | 0.73  | 0.80  |
| `envy_salience`               | 0.625 | 0.427     | 0.00  | 0.52  | 0.80  | 0.90  | 0.90  |
| `compersion_salience`         | 0.225 | 0.450     | 0.00  | 0.00  | 0.00  | 0.23  | 0.90  |
| `enmity_salience`             | 0.638 | 0.427     | 0.00  | 0.60  | 0.83  | 0.86  | 0.90  |

| `cohesive_goals_salience`     | 0.625 | 0.310     | 0.20  | 0.50  | 0.70  | 0.83  | 0.90  |

Several patterns are immediately apparent. Fragmentative dimensions such as `fear_raw` (Mean=0.60), `envy_raw` (Mean=0.63), and `enmity_raw` (Mean=0.63) show higher average intensity than their cohesive counterparts like `hope_raw` (Mean=0.43) and `compersion_raw` (Mean=0.23). The score for `compersion` is particularly notable: 75% of the documents have a raw score of 0.225 or less, suggesting that celebrating the success of others is a very rare rhetorical appeal in this corpus. In contrast, appeals to `envy` are common and intense.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a more holistic view of rhetorical strategy. The `full_cohesion_index`, which synthesizes all ten dimensions, serves as a powerful summary statistic for a document's overall rhetorical posture.

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Derived Metrics (N=4)**

| Metric                            | Mean    | Std. Dev. | Min     | 25%     | 50%     | 75%     | Max    |
| :-------------------------------- | :------ | :-------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | :----- |
| `identity_tension`                | 0.085   | 0.062     | 0.000   | 0.060   | 0.100   | 0.125   | 0.140  |
| `emotional_tension`               | 0.070   | 0.008     | 0.060   | 0.068   | 0.070   | 0.073   | 0.080  |
| `success_tension`                 | 0.000   | 0.000     | 0.000   | 0.000   | 0.000   | 0.000   | 0.000  |
| `relational_tension`              | 0.045   | 0.090     | 0.000   | 0.000   | 0.000   | 0.045   | 0.180  |
| `goal_tension`                    | 0.045   | 0.057     | 0.000   | 0.000   | 0.030   | 0.075   | 0.120  |
| `strategic_contradiction_index`   | 0.049   | 0.038     | 0.014   | 0.031   | 0.040   | 0.059   | 0.102  |
| `full_cohesion_index`             | -0.110  | 0.674     | -0.735  | -0.461  | -0.272  | 0.079   | 0.840  |

The `full_cohesion_index` has a mean of -0.110 but an enormous standard deviation of 0.674, confirming the extreme polarization observed in the raw scores. The documents are not clustered around a neutral center but are pushed to the poles.

The `strategic_contradiction_index` provides a measure of rhetorical complexity or incoherence. The highest score (0.102) belongs to the Sanders speech, driven by significant tension in the identity (0.140), relational (0.180), and goal (0.120) dimensions. This indicates a message that simultaneously invokes strong appeals to both sides of these oppositional pairs—for example, framing a struggle in terms of both `enmity` against an out-group and `amity` within the in-group. In contrast, the McCain speech has a very low contradiction score (0.014), reflecting a highly consistent and coherent cohesive message.

The relationship between cohesion and contradiction is visualized by plotting the `full_cohesion_index` against the `strategic_contradiction_index`. In this corpus, the most cohesive document (McCain) is also the least contradictory. The most contradictory document (Sanders) is moderately fragmentative. The most fragmentative document (King) has a low-to-moderate contradiction score, suggesting its message is consistently and coherently fragmentative. This analysis allows for a more nuanced classification of rhetoric beyond a simple cohesive/fragmentative binary.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals the deep structural logic of the rhetorical strategies within this corpus. The findings strongly suggest the existence of two coherent, opposing "meta-strategies."

**Table 3: Selected Pearson Correlations (r) for CFF Raw Scores (N=4)**

| Dimension 1                 | Dimension 2                 | Correlation (r) | Interpretation                               |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `tribal_dominance_raw`      | `fear_raw`                  | 0.996           | Near-perfect positive correlation            |
| `amity_raw`                 | `cohesive_goals_raw`        | 0.999           | Near-perfect positive correlation            |
| `tribal_dominance_salience` | `compersion_salience`       | -1.000          | Perfect negative correlation                 |
| `individual_dignity_raw`    | `tribal_dominance_raw`      | -0.778          | Strong negative correlation                  |
| `hope_raw`                  | `fear_raw`                  | -0.571          | Moderate negative correlation                |
| `amity_raw`                 | `enmity_raw`                | -0.508          | Moderate negative correlation                |
| `fragmentative_goals_raw`   | `tribal_dominance_raw`      | 0.987           | Near-perfect positive correlation            |
| `cohesive_goals_raw`        | `individual_dignity_raw`    | 0.868           | Very strong positive correlation             |

The matrix can be conceptually divided into two clusters:

1.  **The Fragmentative Cluster:** `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, `enmity`, and `fragmentative_goals`. These dimensions are all strongly and positively inter-correlated. The near-perfect correlation between `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fear_raw` (r = 0.996) suggests that, in this corpus, appeals to in-group identity are almost always packaged with appeals to fear. This cluster represents a coherent rhetorical strategy aimed at social fragmentation. This is exemplified in the provided evidence, where a goal is framed in terms of destruction. As Steve King stated: `"And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt)`. This quote, scored for `fragmentative_goals`, illustrates how this cluster operates by defining success through opposition and potential destruction.

2.  **The Cohesive Cluster:** `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `compersion`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals`. These dimensions are also strongly and positively inter-correlated. The near-perfect correlation between `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` (r = 0.999) indicates that appeals to friendly relationships are intrinsically linked to the articulation of shared, constructive goals. This is supported by textual evidence from a speech by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: `"So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)`. This statement, scored for `cohesive_goals`, directly links a hopeful vision to a goal of solidarity that transcends typical divisions.

Crucially, these two clusters are strongly negatively correlated with each other, confirming the oppositional nature of these meta-strategies. The perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) between `tribal_dominance_salience` and `compersion_salience` is the most striking example. It suggests that in the analyzed texts, it is rhetorically impossible to emphasize in-group superiority while simultaneously celebrating the success of an out-group.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns provide preliminary validation for the CFF's theoretical underpinnings. The framework posits that its dimensional pairs are oppositional, and the consistent negative correlations between them (e.g., `individual_dignity` vs. `tribal_dominance`, r = -0.778) support this construct validity. This suggests the framework is well-aligned with the rhetorical logic present in this specific corpus.

An unexpected finding emerges from a closer look at the Steve King speech. Despite being the most fragmentative document overall (Full Cohesion Index = -0.74), it contains rhetoric that scores for `individual_dignity`. As Steve King stated: `"That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt)`. This highlights a key strength of the CFF. A simple sentiment analysis might miss this nuance. The CFF, by scoring dimensions independently, captures this instance of a cohesive appeal embedded within a predominantly fragmentative message. This could be interpreted as a strategic use of universalist language to legitimize a particularist agenda, a sophisticated rhetorical technique that warrants further investigation.

Similarly, the analysis reveals how speakers can invoke cohesive language to frame potentially divisive goals. The quote from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez about "class solidarity" is scored as a `cohesive_goal`, yet it is part of a speech that also scores high on `tribal_dominance` and `envy`, resulting in a negative overall cohesion score. This demonstrates how the CFF can deconstruct complex messages that blend unifying language for an in-group with fragmentative language against an out-group. Another piece of evidence from the Steve King speech, scored for `cohesive_goals`, shows a similar pattern where a unifying symbol is invoked. As Steve King stated: `"We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt)`. Invoking the Constitution is a cohesive act, but the context of the speech may weaponize it for fragmentative ends, a complexity the CFF is designed to uncover.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework appears to be an effective tool for dissecting political rhetoric, with several key strengths:

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework demonstrated high discriminatory power, producing a wide variance in scores that clearly distinguished the four documents. The `full_cohesion_index` effectively rank-ordered the documents from highly cohesive to highly fragmentative.
*   **Construct Validity:** The strong, consistent negative correlations between opposing dimensions (e.g., `amity`/`enmity`, `hope`/`fear`) provide initial, albeit tentative, support for the framework's construct validity. The dimensions behave in the oppositional manner predicted by the theory.
*   **Insight from Derived Metrics:** The `strategic_contradiction_index` and the various `tension` indices proved valuable, revealing a layer of rhetorical complexity that raw scores alone would not capture. They successfully identified documents with mixed, complex, or potentially incoherent messaging.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF appears to be an excellent fit for analyzing polarized political discourse. The dimensional structure maps well onto the observed rhetorical strategies, and the framework's ability to handle contradiction is essential for understanding modern political communication.

The primary limitation in this assessment is the inability to perform the speaker-level analysis due to the missing corpus manifest. This would have provided another layer of validation by testing if the framework could identify distinct and consistent rhetorical profiles for each political actor.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this pilot study, while preliminary, offer several avenues for theoretical consideration and future research. The most significant insight is the apparent crystallization of two opposing rhetorical meta-strategies—one cohesive, one fragmentative—within this small sample of American political discourse. This suggests that political actors may be drawing from well-defined, internally coherent rhetorical playbooks. The "fragmentative playbook" appears to tightly bundle appeals to tribalism, fear, and enmity, while the "cohesive playbook" links dignity, hope, and amity. The rarity of crossover between these strategies (as evidenced by the strong negative correlations) suggests a highly polarized and constrained rhetorical environment.

This analysis allows for the tentative identification of rhetorical archetypes. The McCain speech represents a "Cohesive Unifier," characterized by high cohesion and low contradiction. The King speech embodies the "Fragmentative Purist," with low cohesion and low contradiction—a message that is consistently divisive. The Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez speeches represent a more complex "Populist Challenger" archetype, blending fragmentative critiques of an "oligarchic" out-group with cohesive appeals to an in-group ("class solidarity"). These speeches are defined by their higher `strategic_contradiction_index`, reflecting their dual-pronged rhetorical approach.

The broader significance of this analysis lies in its methodological implications. It demonstrates that a multi-dimensional, contradiction-aware framework like the CFF can provide a much richer and more accurate picture of political language than traditional sentiment analysis. By not forcing a binary choice (e.g., a text is either hopeful or fearful), the CFF captures the reality of sophisticated communication where multiple, even competing, appeals are deployed simultaneously.

The primary limitation remains the sample size. An N of 4 is insufficient for any generalizable claims. These findings should be treated as a set of hypotheses to be tested on a much larger and more diverse corpus of texts. Future research should aim to:
1.  Apply the CFF to a large, longitudinal corpus of political speech to see if these "meta-strategies" hold over time and across different political contexts.
2.  Conduct a speaker-level analysis with a proper corpus manifest to determine if political actors have stable, identifiable rhetorical profiles.
3.  Investigate the relationship between high `strategic_contradiction_index` scores and audience reception. Are contradictory messages perceived as more sophisticated and authentic, or as incoherent and untrustworthy?
4.  Explore the specific linguistic cues and framing devices that trigger high scores on each of the CFF's dimensions.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework has successfully demonstrated the framework's potential for generating nuanced insights into political discourse. Despite the severe limitations imposed by the small sample size, the study identified clear and compelling patterns of rhetorical polarization, uncovered two distinct and opposing meta-strategies, and highlighted the utility of advanced metrics like the `strategic_contradiction_index` for understanding complex messaging.

The results provide preliminary support for the CFF's design, as the oppositional dimensions behaved as theoretically predicted. The framework proved effective at discriminating between different rhetorical styles and deconstructing complex messages that blend cohesive and fragmentative elements. The analysis suggests that political discourse in this sample is not a random assortment of appeals but is highly structured, with speakers drawing from coherent but mutually exclusive rhetorical playbooks. By moving beyond simple positive/negative scoring, this methodology offers a promising path for researchers seeking to understand the intricate ways in which language is used to build or break social cohesion. The hypotheses generated by this pilot study provide a clear roadmap for future, larger-scale investigations into the dynamics of political communication.
