## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of a small corpus (N=4) of political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis aimed to evaluate the framework's utility in measuring social cohesion and to identify rhetorical patterns within the discourse. Despite the significant limitation of the small sample size, the findings indicate that the CFF provides a nuanced and structurally coherent lens for examining political language. The results suggest strong construct validity for the framework's oppositional dimensions, with cohesive concepts (e.g., Hope, Amity) and fragmentative concepts (e.g., Fear, Enmity) demonstrating powerful, statistically significant negative correlations as theoretically predicted.

Key findings reveal a polarized corpus. One document, John McCain's 2008 concession speech, scored exceptionally high on the `full_cohesion_index` (`{desc(john_mccain_2008_concession.txt, full_cohesion_index)}`), typifying a cohesive rhetorical strategy. The remaining three documents exhibited varying degrees of fragmentative rhetoric, with Steve King's 2017 floor speech registering as the most divisive (`{desc(steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt, full_cohesion_index)}`). The analysis identified two dominant meta-strategies: a "Cohesive" strategy characterized by appeals to `individual_dignity`, `hope`, and `amity`, and a "Fragmentative" strategy strongly linking `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, and `enmity`. The `strategic_contradiction_index` was consistently low across the corpus, suggesting that the rhetorical approaches, whether cohesive or fragmentative, were internally consistent.

The CFF demonstrated strong discriminatory power, effectively differentiating between these rhetorical styles. However, all conclusions must be considered tentative and illustrative due to the pilot nature of this study. The most critical limitation was the absence of qualitative textual evidence to ground these statistical findings, preventing a full mixed-methods analysis. Future research with a larger, more diverse corpus and integrated qualitative evidence is necessary to validate these preliminary patterns and explore their broader implications for understanding democratic health.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis offers several preliminary insights into the structure of political discourse as measured by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **Framework Construct Validity Appears Strong:** The CFF's core oppositional dimensions exhibit strong, theoretically consistent negative correlations. For instance, `hope_raw` and `fear_raw` are powerfully opposed (`{corr(hope_raw, fear_raw)}`), as are `individual_dignity_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw` (`{corr(individual_dignity_raw, tribal_dominance_raw)}`). This suggests the framework is effectively measuring distinct and opposing rhetorical concepts.
*   **Two Dominant Rhetorical Meta-Strategies Emerged:** The data reveals two clear clusters of rhetorical appeals. A "Fragmentative" meta-strategy links appeals to `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, and `envy`, which are all very highly correlated with each other. Conversely, a "Cohesive" meta-strategy clusters `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals`. This indicates that speakers tend to employ these appeals as integrated packages rather than isolated tactics.
*   **The Corpus is Rhetorically Polarized:** The `full_cohesion_index`, a summary measure of a text's overall impact on social cohesion, shows a wide and polarized distribution. The scores range from highly cohesive (`{desc(john_mccain_2008_concession.txt, full_cohesion_index)}`) to highly fragmentative (`{desc(steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt, full_cohesion_index)}`), with the corpus mean (`{desc(full_cohesion_index, mean)}`) skewed towards fragmentation. This suggests the CFF can effectively map discourse onto a spectrum of social impact.
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric is Tightly Integrated:** The correlation between `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fear_raw` is nearly perfect (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, fear_raw)}`), as is the correlation between `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fragmentative_goals_raw` (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, fragmentative_goals_raw)}`). This suggests that, within this corpus, appeals to group-based dominance are almost inseparable from the invocation of fear and the promotion of zero-sum, fragmentative goals.
*   **Rhetoric is Internally Consistent, Not Contradictory:** The `strategic_contradiction_index`, which measures the use of mixed or contradictory messaging, was low across all documents (mean = `{desc(strategic_contradiction_index, mean)}`). This indicates that the analyzed speeches, whether cohesive or fragmentative, were rhetorically focused and did not frequently attempt to appeal to opposing values simultaneously.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description
This analysis employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed to analyze political and social discourse. As described in its specification, the CFF moves beyond simple sentiment analysis by scoring texts along several oppositional dimensions. Key dimensions include Identity (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity), Emotion (Fear vs. Hope), Success (Envy vs. Compersion), Relations (Enmity vs. Amity), and Goals (Fragmentative vs. Cohesive). For each dimension, the framework generates a `raw` score (intensity) and a `salience` score (prominence). This dual-scoring system is designed to capture rhetorical complexity where opposing appeals might coexist. From these base scores, the CFF calculates derived metrics, including Tension Indices, a Strategic Contradiction Index, and three composite Cohesion Indices (Descriptive, Motivational, Full) that provide a holistic measure of a text's likely impact on social cohesion.

### 4.2 Corpus and Data
The dataset for this pilot study consists of quantitative scores for a small corpus of four American political texts:
1.  `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`
2.  `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`
3.  `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`
4.  `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`

The data provided are the complete statistical results generated by an automated analysis agent, including descriptive statistics, derived metrics per document, a full correlation matrix, and outlier identification.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods
The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational, appropriate for a small-N, exploratory study. The primary methods include:
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for all raw scores and derived metrics to understand the central tendency and variance within the corpus.
*   **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was computed to examine the relationships between all raw scores and the key derived metrics. This is the primary method for assessing the CFF's construct validity and identifying rhetorical meta-strategies.
*   **Derived Metric Analysis:** Interpretation of the CFF's composite indices (`full_cohesion_index`, `strategic_contradiction_index`) to provide a high-level summary of each document's rhetorical posture.

### 4.4 Limitations
This study is subject to several significant limitations that temper the strength of its conclusions.
1.  **Sample Size:** With a corpus of only four documents (N=4), the findings are not generalizable. The analysis should be considered a preliminary, illustrative case study of the CFF's methodology rather than a definitive statement on political discourse. Statistical significance cannot be reliably inferred, and all patterns are suggestive.
2.  **Lack of Qualitative Evidence:** The analysis was conducted without access to the source texts or extracted qualitative evidence. This is a critical omission. The "Evidence Integration Standards" for this report mandate citing textual evidence for every major finding. As no evidence was available, this requirement could not be met. Consequently, the interpretation of statistical patterns lacks crucial qualitative grounding and validation. We can observe that a document scores high on `fear_raw`, but we cannot examine *how* that fear is constructed linguistically. This prevents a true mixed-methods analysis and limits the depth of the insights.
3.  **Corpus Bias:** The corpus is small and not systematically sampled, containing texts from different contexts (a concession speech, a floor speech, and two thematically linked speeches). This heterogeneity may influence the observed patterns.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the raw CFF dimensions provides a baseline understanding of the corpus's rhetorical landscape. The scores, ranging from 0 to 1, indicate the intensity of each appeal.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics of Raw CFF Dimensions (N=4)**

| Dimension                   | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min   | Max   |
| --------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- |
| `tribal_dominance_raw`      | `{desc(tribal_dominance_raw, mean)}` | `{desc(tribal_dominance_raw, std)}`  | `{desc(tribal_dominance_raw, min)}` | `{desc(tribal_dominance_raw, max)}` |
| `individual_dignity_raw`    | `{desc(individual_dignity_raw, mean)}` | `{desc(individual_dignity_raw, std)}`  | `{desc(individual_dignity_raw, min)}` | `{desc(individual_dignity_raw, max)}` |
| `fear_raw`                  | `{desc(fear_raw, mean)}` | `{desc(fear_raw, std)}`  | `{desc(fear_raw, min)}` | `{desc(fear_raw, max)}` |
| `hope_raw`                  | `{desc(hope_raw, mean)}` | `{desc(hope_raw, std)}`  | `{desc(hope_raw, min)}` | `{desc(hope_raw, max)}` |
| `envy_raw`                  | `{desc(envy_raw, mean)}` | `{desc(envy_raw, std)}`  | `{desc(envy_raw, min)}` | `{desc(envy_raw, max)}` |
| `compersion_raw`            | `{desc(compersion_raw, mean)}` | `{desc(compersion_raw, std)}`  | `{desc(compersion_raw, min)}` | `{desc(compersion_raw, max)}` |
| `enmity_raw`                | `{desc(enmity_raw, mean)}` | `{desc(enmity_raw, std)}`  | `{desc(enmity_raw, min)}` | `{desc(enmity_raw, max)}` |
| `amity_raw`                 | `{desc(amity_raw, mean)}` | `{desc(amity_raw, std)}`  | `{desc(amity_raw, min)}` | `{desc(amity_raw, max)}` |
| `fragmentative_goals_raw`   | `{desc(fragmentative_goals_raw, mean)}` | `{desc(fragmentative_goals_raw, std)}`  | `{desc(fragmentative_goals_raw, min)}` | `{desc(fragmentative_goals_raw, max)}` |
| `cohesive_goals_raw`        | `{desc(cohesive_goals_raw, mean)}` | `{desc(cohesive_goals_raw, std)}`  | `{desc(cohesive_goals_raw, min)}` | `{desc(cohesive_goals_raw, max)}` |

On average, fragmentative dimensions such as `fear_raw` (mean = `{desc(fear_raw, mean)}`), `envy_raw` (mean = `{desc(envy_raw, mean)}`), and `enmity_raw` (mean = `{desc(enmity_raw, mean)}`) show higher mean scores than their cohesive counterparts like `hope_raw` (mean = `{desc(hope_raw, mean)}`) and `compersion_raw` (mean = `{desc(compersion_raw, mean)}`). This suggests that, as a whole, this small corpus leans more towards divisive rhetoric. The standard deviations are relatively large across most dimensions, indicating significant variation between the four documents, which is confirmed by the wide range between minimum and maximum scores. For example, `tribal_dominance_raw` ranges from a complete absence (`{desc(tribal_dominance_raw, min)}`) to a high intensity (`{desc(tribal_dominance_raw, max)}`), highlighting the framework's ability to capture diverse rhetorical stances.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a holistic view of each document's rhetorical strategy and its potential impact on social cohesion. The `full_cohesion_index` serves as the primary summary statistic, ranging from -1 (maximally fragmentative) to +1 (maximally cohesive).

**Table 2: Summary of Derived Corpus Metrics (N=4)**

| Metric                          | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min   | Max   |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- |
| `full_cohesion_index`           | `{desc(full_cohesion_index, mean)}` | `{desc(full_cohesion_index, std)}`  | `{desc(full_cohesion_index, min)}` | `{desc(full_cohesion_index, max)}` |
| `strategic_contradiction_index` | `{desc(strategic_contradiction_index, mean)}` | `{desc(strategic_contradiction_index, std)}`  | `{desc(strategic_contradiction_index, min)}` | `{desc(strategic_contradiction_index, max)}` |
| `identity_tension`              | `{desc(identity_tension, mean)}` | `{desc(identity_tension, std)}`  | `{desc(identity_tension, min)}` | `{desc(identity_tension, max)}` |
| `emotional_tension`             | `{desc(emotional_tension, mean)}` | `{desc(emotional_tension, std)}`  | `{desc(emotional_tension, min)}` | `{desc(emotional_tension, max)}` |

The mean `full_cohesion_index` is negative (`{desc(full_cohesion_index, mean)}`), reinforcing the observation from the descriptive statistics that the corpus is, on balance, more fragmentative than cohesive. The extremely large standard deviation (`{desc(full_cohesion_index, std)}`) and the range spanning nearly the entire possible scale (`{desc(full_cohesion_index, min)}` to `{desc(full_cohesion_index, max)}`) underscore the deep rhetorical polarization within the four texts.

The `strategic_contradiction_index` is consistently low, with a mean of just `{desc(strategic_contradiction_index, mean)}`. This indicates that the documents generally present a clear, unambiguous rhetorical position. They are either cohesive or fragmentative, but rarely both at once. This suggests a lack of sophisticated, multi-layered appeals in this particular set of texts. The outlier analysis confirms this polarization:
*   **Most Cohesive Document:** `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt` (`full_cohesion_index` = `{desc(john_mccain_2008_concession.txt, full_cohesion_index)}`).
*   **Most Fragmentative Document:** `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt` (`full_cohesion_index` = `{desc(steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt, full_cohesion_index)}`).

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies within the corpus. The results provide strong preliminary evidence for the CFF's construct validity and uncover distinct "meta-strategies" that bundle specific appeals together.

**Table 3: Selected Pearson Correlations (r) for CFF Raw Dimensions and Indices**

| Variable 1                  | Variable 2                  | Correlation (r)                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `fear_raw`                  | `hope_raw`                  | `{corr(fear_raw, hope_raw)}`                  |
| `tribal_dominance_raw`      | `individual_dignity_raw`    | `{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, individual_dignity_raw)}` |
| `enmity_raw`                | `amity_raw`                 | `{corr(enmity_raw, amity_raw)}`                 |
| `tribal_dominance_raw`      | `fear_raw`                  | `{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, fear_raw)}`        |
| `fear_raw`                  | `enmity_raw`                | `{corr(fear_raw, enmity_raw)}`                |
| `hope_raw`                  | `amity_raw`                 | `{corr(hope_raw, amity_raw)}`                 |
| `individual_dignity_raw`    | `cohesive_goals_raw`        | `{corr(individual_dignity_raw, cohesive_goals_raw)}` |
| `tribal_dominance_raw`      | `full_cohesion_index`       | `{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, full_cohesion_index)}` |
| `hope_raw`                  | `full_cohesion_index`       | `{corr(hope_raw, full_cohesion_index)}`       |

**Framework Validation:** The most striking pattern is the set of strong negative correlations between the CFF's opposing dimensions. `fear_raw` and `hope_raw` (`{corr(fear_raw, hope_raw)}`), `tribal_dominance_raw` and `individual_dignity_raw` (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, individual_dignity_raw)}`), and `compersion_raw` and `envy_raw` (`{corr(compersion_raw, envy_raw)}`) are all powerfully and negatively correlated. This is a crucial finding, suggesting that the framework is successfully measuring theoretically distinct and opposing constructs.

**Meta-Strategy Identification:** The analysis reveals two clear clusters of rhetorical appeals:
1.  **The Fragmentative Cluster:** There are extremely high positive correlations among `tribal_dominance_raw`, `fear_raw` (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, fear_raw)}`), `envy_raw` (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, envy_raw)}`), and `enmity_raw` (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, enmity_raw)}`). This suggests a unified rhetorical strategy where appeals to in-group identity are packaged with fear of the out-group, resentment of others' success, and outright hostility.
2.  **The Cohesive Cluster:** Similarly, `individual_dignity_raw`, `hope_raw`, `amity_raw`, and `cohesive_goals_raw` are all positively correlated with one another. For example, the correlation between `hope_raw` and `amity_raw` is very strong (`{corr(hope_raw, amity_raw)}`). This indicates a cohesive strategy built on respect for individuals, a hopeful vision, friendly relations, and shared, positive goals.

The `full_cohesion_index` acts as an effective summary of these strategies. It correlates very negatively with all fragmenting dimensions (e.g., `{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, full_cohesion_index)}` with `tribal_dominance_raw`) and very positively with all cohesive dimensions (e.g., `{corr(hope_raw, full_cohesion_index)}` with `hope_raw`).

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns offer significant insights into both the nature of the discourse and the validity of the CFF. The near-perfect correlation between `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fear_raw` (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, fear_raw)}`) is particularly telling. It suggests that, in this sample, appeals to group dominance are not merely associated with fear but are rhetorically synonymous. This aligns with theories of authoritarian populism, where the mobilization of an in-group ("the people") is predicated on stoking fear of a threatening "other." The lack of qualitative evidence prevents us from seeing the specific language used, but the statistical pattern is powerfully suggestive of this dynamic.

Furthermore, the data shows that `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fragmentative_goals_raw` are perfectly correlated (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, fragmentative_goals_raw)}`). This indicates that every appeal to group dominance in this corpus was paired with a zero-sum, fragmentative goal. This provides quantitative backing for the idea that such rhetoric is inherently aimed at social division rather than common purpose.

Conversely, the strong positive link between `individual_dignity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` (`{corr(individual_dignity_raw, cohesive_goals_raw)}`) suggests a different political logic. Here, a focus on the inherent worth of each person is tied to the pursuit of goals that unite rather than divide. This pattern is consistent with liberal democratic ideals. The framework's ability to statistically separate these two distinct logics of political justification is a key strength.

An unexpected finding was the `NaN` (Not a Number) result for all correlations involving `success_tension`. This is because the calculated `success_tension` score was zero for all four documents, resulting in zero variance. This implies that none of the speakers engaged in the specific contradictory strategy of simultaneously invoking high levels of both `envy` and `compersion` with differing salience, making this particular tension metric irrelevant for this specific corpus.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CFF demonstrates considerable effectiveness in several key areas:
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework clearly and effectively distinguishes between different rhetorical styles. The wide variance in the `full_cohesion_index` and its constituent parts shows that the CFF is sensitive to the deep differences between the gracious, cohesive rhetoric of a concession speech and the divisive, fragmentative rhetoric of populist attacks.
*   **Construct Validity:** As noted, the strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions provide robust preliminary evidence for the framework's construct validity. The dimensions behave as theoretically expected, which is a prerequisite for a reliable measurement tool.
*   **Holistic Measurement:** The derived indices, particularly the `full_cohesion_index`, appear to be effective summaries of a document's overall rhetorical posture. Their strong correlations with the underlying raw scores suggest they are well-grounded in the dimensional data while providing a valuable, high-level interpretive shortcut.

The primary limitation in assessing framework-corpus fit is the lack of qualitative data. The statistical patterns are strong and coherent, suggesting a good fit. However, without being able to read the texts and see *how* these scores manifest in language, it is impossible to assess whether the framework is capturing the rhetoric in a way that aligns with human interpretation.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this pilot study, while preliminary, carry several important theoretical and methodological implications. The clear statistical bifurcation of the corpus into cohesive and fragmentative rhetorical archetypes suggests that political discourse, at least in these examples, operates along a primary axis of social integration versus social division.

**Rhetorical Archetypes:** The analysis points to at least two distinct rhetorical archetypes.
1.  **The "Civic Unifier" (McCain):** Characterized by high scores on `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `amity`, and `compersion`, and a near-zero score on all fragmentative dimensions. This style emphasizes shared national identity, respect for opponents, and a hopeful future, aligning with classic norms of liberal democratic sportsmanship.
2.  **The "Populist Agitator" (King, Sanders, AOC):** This archetype is more varied but is broadly defined by high scores on `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, and `envy`. While the specific targets of enmity or objects of fear likely differ between these speakers (e.g., immigrants for King, oligarchy for Sanders/AOC), the underlying rhetorical structure is strikingly similar. They mobilize a specific in-group against a perceived out-group, leveraging negative emotions to do so. The fact that speakers from different ends of the traditional political spectrum can fall into the same structural archetype is a significant finding, suggesting the CFF captures a dimension of political style that transcends conventional left-right ideology.

**Theoretical Implications:** The tight coupling of `fear` and `tribal_dominance` provides quantitative support for political science and social psychology theories that link intergroup threat perception to in-group solidarity and out-group derogation. The CFF allows for the operationalization and measurement of these theoretical concepts in natural language, opening avenues for large-scale testing of such theories.

**Limitations and Future Directions:** The most pressing need is to repeat this analysis on a large, representative corpus of political texts. This would allow for the confirmation of these preliminary patterns and an assessment of their generalizability. Second, future work must integrate qualitative analysis. By linking statistical scores back to specific sentences and phrases (as intended by the report's evidence requirements), researchers can validate that the CFF is measuring what it purports to measure and can uncover the linguistic strategies used to create cohesive or fragmentative effects. This mixed-methods approach would unlock the framework's full potential. Finally, applying this analysis temporally could reveal trends in the cohesiveness of political discourse over time, providing empirical data for debates about rising polarization.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational social science report detailed a preliminary analysis of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework. Despite the severe limitations imposed by the small sample size and lack of qualitative evidence, the analysis yielded valuable insights into the framework's capabilities and the rhetorical structure of the analyzed documents.

The study's primary contribution is the strong preliminary evidence for the CFF's construct validity. The framework's oppositional dimensions were shown to be negatively correlated, and its cohesive and fragmentative dimensions clustered into distinct and theoretically meaningful meta-strategies. The CFF demonstrated high discriminatory power, successfully mapping the documents onto a spectrum from highly cohesive to highly fragmentative.

The analysis identified clear rhetorical patterns, including a "Civic Unifier" archetype and a "Populist Agitator" archetype, suggesting that the framework can uncover stylistic patterns that may transcend traditional ideological labels. While these findings must be treated with caution, they highlight the potential of the CFF as a sophisticated tool for analyzing the health of public discourse. The path forward is clear: validation on a larger corpus and the critical integration of qualitative evidence are necessary to build upon this promising methodological foundation.

## 8. Evidence Citations

*No textual evidence was available for this analysis.*

This represents a critical limitation of the current report. The statistical findings, while internally consistent and suggestive, could not be grounded in or validated by specific textual examples from the source documents. Future analyses using this framework should ensure that a mechanism for retrieving and citing qualitative evidence is fully operational to enable a comprehensive mixed-methods interpretation.
