    "The corpus contains only 4 documents (N=4). This sample size is insufficient for statistically significant group comparisons between 'institutional' (N=1) and 'populist' (N=3) styles as implied by the research question.",
    "The experiment definition contains two different research questions. The initial `questions` field asks a comparative question ('Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion...'), while the markdown `Research Questions` section asks a descriptive one ('What are the baseline cohesion and tension scores...').",
    "There is a version mismatch within the framework file. The machine-readable appendix specifies `framework_version: \"10.2\"`, while the document's title, filename (`cff_v10.md`), and prose refer to version \"10.0\"."
