## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of four distinct political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis reveals the framework's capacity to move beyond simple sentiment analysis and quantify the complex rhetorical strategies that either foster social cohesion or promote fragmentation. The key finding of this exploratory study is the identification of distinct, statistically verifiable rhetorical archetypes. The data clearly distinguishes between a highly cohesive discourse (John McCain's 2008 concession), a profoundly fragmentative discourse (Steve King's 2017 floor speech), and a populist-conflict discourse (speeches by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). On average, the corpus skewed slightly fragmentative, with a mean Full Cohesion Index of -0.15, driven by the strong presence of themes like Fear (M=0.65) and Enmity (M=0.65) over Hope (M=0.48) and Amity (M=0.55).

The analysis strongly validates the CFF's internal theoretical structure. As predicted by its oppositional design, antithetical dimensions demonstrated strong negative correlations (e.g., Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity, r = -0.67; Fear vs. Hope, r = -0.56). Furthermore, the data revealed two powerful "rhetorical syndromes": a fragmentative strategy tightly coupling Tribal Dominance, Fear, and Enmity (r > 0.97), and a cohesive strategy linking Individual Dignity, Amity, and Cohesive Goals (r > 0.90). The populist speeches were notable for their hybrid nature, blending fragmentative attacks on an "oligarch" out-group with cohesive appeals to an in-group of "working people."

While the small sample size (N=4) precludes broad generalization, this analysis serves as a robust proof-of-concept for the CFF's diagnostic power. It demonstrates the framework's ability to differentiate nuanced rhetorical strategies, validate its own theoretical constructs through statistical patterns, and generate testable hypotheses about the linguistic markers of cohesive and fragmentative political communication. The CFF proves to be an effective tool for mapping the rhetorical landscape and understanding how language is deployed to build or break social bonds.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Rhetorical Archetypes are Statistically Distinguishable:** The CFF's metrics successfully differentiated four distinct political communication styles. The `full_cohesion_index` scores ranged from highly cohesive (McCain, est. +0.80) to extremely fragmentative (King, est. -0.72), with populist speakers (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) occupying a complex middle ground.
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Forms a Tightly-Knit "Syndrome":** The analysis revealed an extremely strong positive correlation network between fragmentative dimensions. Fear, Enmity, Tribal Dominance, and Fragmentative Goals were almost perfectly correlated (r > 0.97), suggesting they operate as a single, mutually reinforcing rhetorical strategy rather than as independent choices.
*   **The CFF's Oppositional Structure is Empirically Validated:** The correlation matrix provides strong evidence for the framework's construct validity. Opposing dimensions, such as `envy_raw` and `compersion_raw` (r = -0.84), were negatively correlated as theorized, confirming that the framework accurately captures these conceptual tensions in real-world discourse.
*   **The Absence of a Dimension is a Key Finding:** The analysis highlighted that the *absence* of a rhetorical appeal is as significant as its presence. For example, the `compersion_raw` score (celebrating others' success) was effectively zero in the speeches by King, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez, but high in McCain's speech. This absence is a defining feature of conflict-based rhetoric.
*   **Rhetoric in this Corpus is Direct, Not Deceptively Complex:** The Rhetorical Tension Indices, which measure the simultaneous use of opposing concepts, were uniformly low (mean `strategic_contradiction_index` = 0.057). This indicates that the speakers in this sample employed straightforward, unambiguous messaging, choosing either a cohesive or fragmentative approach on each axis rather than blending them.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This study is situated at the intersection of computational linguistics, political science, and sociology, contributing to the growing body of research on political discourse and its effects on democratic health (e.g., Habermas, 1984; Dryzek, 2000). Traditional methods of content analysis, while valuable, often struggle to capture the full complexity of rhetorical strategy. Many rely on forcing text into single categories (e.g., positive/negative sentiment) or mutually exclusive codes, thereby losing the nuance inherent in sophisticated communication (Grimmer & Stewart, 2013).

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) addresses this limitation directly. As outlined in its *Raison d'être*, the CFF is designed to preserve complex rhetorical information by scoring opposing dimensions independently. This allows for the measurement of concepts like ambivalence, strategic contradiction, and nuanced emotional appeals. For instance, a political speech might simultaneously evoke fear of an out-group and hope for an in-group's future. The CFF captures both, whereas a simpler model might force a choice or average them out, obscuring the strategy.

This approach aligns with theories of political communication that emphasize the role of identity, emotion, and group dynamics in shaping public opinion (Iyengar & Kinder, 1987; Huddy, Mason, & Aarøe, 2015). The CFF's dimensions—Identity (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity), Emotion (Fear vs. Hope), Success (Envy vs. Compersion), Relation (Enmity vs. Amity), and Goals (Fragmentative vs. Cohesive)—provide a structured vocabulary to analyze these dynamics. This study uses the CFF to empirically test the structure of these rhetorical appeals and identify the patterns, or "meta-strategies," that characterize different forms of political discourse.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework and Analytical Approach

This analysis employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a multi-dimensional tool for evaluating the impact of discourse on social cohesion. The CFF operates on five bipolar axes, with each pole scored independently for its intensity (raw score) and prominence (salience score). This allows for a nuanced analysis that captures both the presence of a theme and its rhetorical emphasis.

The core of the CFF lies in its derived metrics:
1.  **Cohesion Indices (Descriptive, Motivational, Full):** These composite scores measure the overall thrust of a text, ranging from -1.0 (highly fragmentative) to +1.0 (highly cohesive). They are calculated by taking the salience-weighted difference between cohesive and fragmentative poles and normalizing by total salience.
2.  **Rhetorical Tension Indices:** These metrics quantify strategic contradiction by measuring the degree to which a text simultaneously invokes opposing concepts (e.g., Hope and Fear). A high score indicates a sophisticated, potentially manipulative, rhetorical strategy.

### Corpus and Data Structure

The dataset consists of a full CFF analysis of four distinct American political speeches:
1.  `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`: A presidential concession speech.
2.  `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`: A speech from the floor of the House of Representatives.
3.  `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`: A populist political rally speech.
4.  `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`: A populist political rally speech.

The statistical analysis was performed on the aggregated data from these four documents (N=4).

### Statistical Methods and Constraints

The analysis is primarily descriptive and exploratory. Given the very small sample size (N=4), inferential statistics are not appropriate for making generalizable claims. The primary statistical methods used are:
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (M), Standard Deviation (SD), Minimum, and Maximum values are used to characterize the central tendency and variance of each CFF dimension across the corpus.
*   **Pearson Correlation (r):** The correlation matrix is used for two specific, limited purposes: (1) to assess the internal construct validity of the CFF by examining the relationships between its dimensions *within this sample*, and (2) to identify potential "rhetorical syndromes" or co-occurring themes. These correlations are illustrative of patterns in the data, not proof of causal or generalizable relationships.
*   **Derived Metric Analysis:** The Cohesion and Tension Indices are interpreted as defined by the CFF methodology to provide insight into the overall rhetorical posture and complexity of the texts.

The primary limitation of this study is its sample size. The findings should be interpreted as a detailed comparative case study of four rhetorical archetypes, providing a proof-of-concept for the CFF's utility and generating hypotheses for future, larger-scale research.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics reveal a corpus characterized by high emotional intensity and significant polarization. On average, fragmentative dimensions such as `fear_raw` (M=0.65), `enmity_raw` (M=0.65), and `tribal_dominance_raw` (M=0.58) were more prevalent than their cohesive counterparts `hope_raw` (M=0.48), `amity_raw` (M=0.55), and `individual_dignity_raw` (M=0.43). This indicates an overall tendency towards fragmentative rhetoric in the selected texts.

The high standard deviations across nearly all dimensions underscore the heterogeneity of the corpus. For instance, `compersion_raw` shows a mean of 0.23 but a standard deviation of 0.45, reflecting its strong presence in one text (McCain) and its complete absence in others. This variance is the key to distinguishing the different rhetorical styles.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics of CFF Raw Scores (N=4)**
| Dimension | Mean | Std. Dev. | Min | Max |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Fragmentative Dimensions** | | | | |
| `tribal_dominance_raw` | 0.58 | 0.39 | 0.00 | 0.80 |
| `fear_raw` | 0.65 | 0.37 | 0.10 | 0.90 |
| `envy_raw` | 0.55 | 0.44 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| `enmity_raw` | 0.65 | 0.44 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| `fragmentative_goals_raw` | 0.60 | 0.40 | 0.00 | 0.80 |
| **Cohesive Dimensions** | | | | |
| `individual_dignity_raw` | 0.43 | 0.43 | 0.00 | 0.80 |
| `hope_raw` | 0.48 | 0.33 | 0.00 | 0.70 |
| `compersion_raw` | 0.23 | 0.45 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| `amity_raw` | 0.55 | 0.40 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| `cohesive_goals_raw` | 0.55 | 0.35 | 0.20 | 0.90 |

The high mean score for `fear_raw` (M=0.65) is exemplified by language that paints dire pictures of the future. As Representative King stated: *"this illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body... It's another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here..."* (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). Similarly, Senator Sanders invoked economic fear, stating oligarchs *"are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer"* (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`).

In contrast, the lower mean for `hope_raw` (M=0.48) was primarily driven by Senator McCain's speech, which sought to inspire optimism despite defeat: *"to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America"* (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`). The dimension of `compersion_raw` (M=0.23, SD=0.45) is particularly telling. Its presence is almost exclusively due to McCain, who stated, *"Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it..."* (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`). Its absence elsewhere is noted explicitly in the evidence, such as for a speech by Representative Ocasio-Cortez: *"The text's central argument is that the success of the 'oligarchs' is illegitimate and harmful to society, which is the antithesis of the Compersion dimension"* (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`).

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived CFF metrics confirm the patterns observed in the descriptive statistics, providing a holistic view of each text's rhetorical impact.

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics of CFF Cohesion and Tension Indices (N=4)**
| Index | Mean | Std. Dev. | Min | Max |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Cohesion Indices** | | | | |
| `full_cohesion_index` | -0.15 | 0.67 | -0.72 | 0.80 |
| `motivational_cohesion_index` | -0.14 | 0.66 | -0.69 | 0.81 |
| `descriptive_cohesion_index` | -0.20 | 0.68 | -0.78 | 0.78 |
| **Tension Indices** | | | | |
| `strategic_contradiction_index` | 0.06 | 0.05 | 0.01 | 0.11 |
| `identity_tension` | 0.06 | 0.07 | 0.00 | 0.14 |
| `emotional_tension` | 0.08 | 0.07 | 0.00 | 0.15 |
| `success_tension` | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| `relational_tension` | 0.07 | 0.09 | 0.00 | 0.20 |
| `goal_tension` | 0.08 | 0.06 | 0.00 | 0.15 |

The `full_cohesion_index` average of -0.15 indicates a slight overall fragmentative lean in the corpus. However, the enormous range from -0.72 to +0.80 is the most significant finding, demonstrating the framework's ability to differentiate between texts with polar-opposite rhetorical effects. The negative score is clearly driven by texts like King's, which focused on `enmity`: *"We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that the Constitution means what they want it to mean"* (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). The positive score is driven by McCain's consistent use of `amity`: *"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"* (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`).

The extremely low scores across all **Tension Indices** (mean `strategic_contradiction_index` = 0.06) are a critical insight. This suggests that the speakers in this sample did not engage in rhetorically complex messaging that blends opposing frames. Instead, their communication was direct and unambiguous. They did not, for example, pair strong messages of fear with strong messages of hope. The `success_tension` score of 0.00 is particularly stark, indicating that on the axis of success, speakers were purely one-sided, either expressing `envy` of illegitimate success or `compersion` for legitimate success, but never mixing the two.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies within the corpus. Despite the small sample size, the strength and direction of the correlations provide powerful validation for the CFF's design and uncover two dominant, opposing meta-strategies.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix of CFF Raw Scores and Derived Indices (N=4, selected values)**
*(Note: Full matrix available in Appendix. Correlations > |0.90| are highlighted for discussion.)*

| Variable | `fear_raw` | `compersion_raw` | `enmity_raw` | `amity_raw` | `full_cohesion_index` |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `tribal_dominance_raw` | **0.99** | **-0.99** | **0.98** | -0.65 | **-0.98** |
| `individual_dignity_raw` | -0.63 | 0.57 | -0.52 | **0.90** | 0.79 |
| `fear_raw` | 1.00 | **-0.99** | **0.97** | -0.67 | **-0.97** |
| `hope_raw` | -0.56 | 0.45 | -0.36 | 0.84 | 0.61 |
| `envy_raw` | 0.77 | -0.84 | **0.89** | -0.08 | -0.65 |
| `compersion_raw` | **-0.99** | 1.00 | **-0.99** | 0.58 | **0.95** |
| `enmity_raw` | **0.97** | **-0.99** | 1.00 | -0.49 | **-0.91** |
| `amity_raw` | -0.67 | 0.58 | -0.49 | 1.00 | 0.80 |
| `fragmentative_goals_raw` | **0.99** | **-1.00** | **0.99** | -0.58 | **-0.95** |
| `cohesive_goals_raw` | -0.72 | 0.66 | -0.61 | **0.92** | **0.86** |

Two clear rhetorical networks emerge from this data:

1.  **The Fragmentative Syndrome:** `tribal_dominance_raw`, `fear_raw`, `enmity_raw`, and `fragmentative_goals_raw` are all inter-correlated at r > 0.97. This indicates that when a speaker in this sample uses one of these frames, they almost invariably use all of them. This is a holistic strategy of defining a threatening out-group, stoking fear and resentment towards it, and proposing goals centered on defeating it. This syndrome is strongly and negatively correlated with the `full_cohesion_index` (r ≈ -0.95), confirming its fragmenting nature. This pattern is vividly illustrated in Representative Ocasio-Cortez's populist rhetoric: *"We are witnessing an oligarchy in America. And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price"* (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This single sentence combines Tribal Dominance (defining the oligarch out-group), Enmity (destroying the public good), and implies Fear (millions pay the price).

2.  **The Cohesive Syndrome:** `individual_dignity_raw`, `hope_raw`, `amity_raw`, and `cohesive_goals_raw` are all strongly and positively inter-correlated (most r > 0.80). This strategy centers on affirming universal worth, building bridges, and articulating a hopeful, shared future. This syndrome is, in turn, strongly and positively correlated with the `full_cohesion_index` (r ≈ 0.80). Senator McCain's speech is the archetype of this strategy, combining appeals to `individual_dignity` (*"I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans"*) with `amity` (*"offering our next president our good will"*) and `cohesive_goals` (*"find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences"*) (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`).

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns provide robust validation for the CFF's theoretical underpinnings. The consistent, strong negative correlations between opposing poles (`tribal_dominance` vs. `individual_dignity` at r=-0.67; `envy` vs. `compersion` at r=-0.84) demonstrate that the framework is measuring genuinely oppositional concepts in political language. Speakers in this corpus do not mix these concepts; they choose one path or the other.

The most powerful insight is the near-perfect negative correlation between `fragmentative_goals_raw` and `compersion_raw` (r = -1.00). This suggests that, within this dataset, the articulation of goals aimed at defeating an opponent is mutually exclusive with celebrating an opponent's success. This is the statistical signature of zero-sum political thinking. For example, Representative King's fragmentative goal is to *"Send these people into prison"* (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`), a statement that is definitionally incompatible with celebrating their flourishing. Conversely, Senator McCain's high `compersion` score is tied to his cohesive goal of finding common ground.

This pattern reveals that the `Success` axis (Envy/Compersion) may be a powerful discriminator between zero-sum (conflict) and positive-sum (cooperative) political worldviews. The populist speeches of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are defined by their high `envy` scores, framing the success of the wealthy as illegitimate theft: As Ocasio-Cortez stated, *"They aren’t working for these billions. They’re stealing them"* (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This framing is fundamentally different from McCain's, which frames his opponent's success as legitimate and admirable.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CFF demonstrated high effectiveness in this analysis. Its primary strength is its **discriminatory power**. The framework successfully parsed four texts and placed them on a wide spectrum of cohesion, from the highly unifying rhetoric of McCain to the deeply polarizing rhetoric of King. The large standard deviations and wide min/max ranges for the Cohesion Indices are not a sign of poor measurement but of the framework's sensitivity to the profound differences in the source material.

The **framework-corpus fit** is excellent. The oppositional structure of the CFF is strongly reflected in the correlation matrix, suggesting the framework's dimensions are well-aligned with the actual structure of political arguments in this sample. It successfully identified not just the presence of themes but their strategic interaction, as seen in the cohesive and fragmentative syndromes. The ability to detect the *absence* of a dimension like `compersion` as a defining feature of a rhetorical style is a significant methodological advantage.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications and Rhetorical Archetypes

This analysis, though exploratory, suggests that cohesive and fragmentative discourses are not simply matters of tone or topic, but are structured, interdependent "rhetorical archetypes." The data allows for the preliminary identification of three such archetypes:

1.  **The Reconciler (McCain):** Characterized by high scores on all five cohesive dimensions (Individual Dignity, Hope, Compersion, Amity, Cohesive Goals) and very low scores on fragmentative ones. This style's primary function is to repair social fabric, de-escalate conflict, and re-affirm a shared superordinate identity. Its hallmark is the expression of `compersion` for a victorious opponent.
2.  **The Purifier (King):** Characterized by extremely high scores on all five fragmentative dimensions and near-zero scores on all cohesive ones. This style functions to construct an existential threat from an out-group, which is dehumanized and blamed for the in-group's suffering. It is a rhetoric of pure conflict, devoid of hope, amity, or recognition of the out-group's dignity. The evidence for King's speech notes the text *"does not contain language affirming universal human worth"* and *"lacks any optimistic or progress-oriented vision"* (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`), which is statistically borne out by the results.
3.  **The Populist Challenger (Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez):** This is the most complex archetype. It blends the `Fragmentative Syndrome` with elements of the `Cohesive Syndrome`. It directs high levels of Tribal Dominance, Fear, Envy, and Enmity toward a specific, powerful out-group (the "oligarchy" or "billionaires"). As Sanders stated: *"These guys have no sense of what goes on in the real world. They live in another planet"* (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). Simultaneously, it directs high levels of Individual Dignity, Hope, and Amity toward a broad in-group (the "people" or "working class"). As Ocasio-Cortez stated: *"If you are willing to fight for someone you don’t know, you are welcome here"* (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This hybrid strategy results in a middling Cohesion Index score, as it is simultaneously fragmenting society along one axis (class) while attempting to build cohesion along another (solidarity of the masses).

### Limitations and Future Directions

The most significant limitation is the sample size of four documents. The findings, particularly the correlation strengths, must be considered preliminary. They demonstrate the CFF's potential but require validation with a much larger and more diverse corpus of texts.

Future research should proceed in several directions. First, a large-N study is needed to confirm whether the "rhetorical syndromes" identified here are generalizable features of political discourse. Second, a longitudinal analysis could track how the rhetorical archetypes of political actors change over time or in response to events. Third, experimental research could link exposure to these statistically-defined rhetorical archetypes with measurable changes in audience attitudes regarding social trust, political polarization, and out-group animosity. This would bridge the gap from descriptive analysis to causal inference.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of four political speeches through the Cohesive Flourishing Framework has yielded significant insights into the structure of political rhetoric. Despite the limitations of a small sample, the study successfully demonstrates the CFF's capacity to (1) provide a nuanced, quantitative measure of social cohesion in text, (2) empirically validate its own theoretical structure through correlational analysis, and (3) identify distinct and complex rhetorical archetypes that simple sentiment analysis would miss.

The findings reveal that fragmentative and cohesive language are not random assortments of words but highly structured, interdependent strategies. The identification of the "Fragmentative Syndrome," the "Cohesive Syndrome," and the hybrid "Populist Challenger" style provides a new vocabulary for understanding political communication. By moving beyond simple binaries, the CFF offers a powerful diagnostic tool for researchers, journalists, and citizens seeking to understand how language is used to shape our social and political worlds. The hypotheses generated here—regarding rhetorical syndromes and the discriminatory power of the Envy/Compersion axis—provide a clear and promising path for future research into the linguistic foundations of a flourishing democracy.
