    "analysis_notes": "The document is a highly partisan and emotional political speech. The speaker's rhetoric is consistently built on an 'us vs. them' framework, primarily contrasting law-abiding Americans with a 'lame duck' president and 'criminal aliens.' The analysis focuses on the clear and repeated rhetorical patterns that strongly align with dimensions of fear, enmity, and tribal dominance, while noting the almost complete absence of their positive counterparts."
