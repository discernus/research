## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of four significant American political speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis reveals a stark bifurcation in rhetorical strategies, distinguishing between discourse that promotes social cohesion and that which fosters fragmentation. The key finding is the identification of two distinct and internally consistent rhetorical archetypes: a **Cohesive Bridge-Builder** and a **Fragmentative Champion**. The corpus, on average, leans towards fragmentation, with a mean Full Cohesion Index of -0.149, but this average masks a deep polarization within the data, driven by the profound differences between the archetypes.

The CFF framework demonstrates exceptional construct validity in this analysis. Opposing conceptual dimensions, such as Hope vs. Fear and Amity vs. Enmity, exhibit strong negative correlations as theoretically predicted. The analysis uncovers a tightly-coupled "Fragmentative Cluster" of rhetorical appeals—linking Tribal Dominance, Fear, Enmity, and Envy—that function as a unified meta-strategy in three of the four texts. Conversely, a "Cohesive Cluster"—linking Individual Dignity, Hope, Amity, and Compersion—defines the single conciliatory text. The near-perfect negative correlation between Compersion (celebrating others' success) and Tribal Dominance (r = -0.99) suggests that the presence or absence of magnanimity towards opponents is a powerful diagnostic for the overall cohesive or fragmentative intent of political discourse.

While the small sample size (N=4) limits generalizability, this exploratory analysis serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for the CFF's capacity to move beyond simple sentiment analysis. It empirically maps the underlying architecture of political language, revealing how specific linguistic choices contribute to broader strategies of either unifying a diverse populace or mobilizing a base against a perceived enemy. The findings underscore the framework's utility for scholars of political communication, polarization, and democratic theory, providing a nuanced, data-driven methodology for assessing the health of public discourse.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of political discourse through the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) yields several critical insights into the structure of cohesive and fragmentative rhetoric:

*   **Two Opposing Rhetorical Archetypes Dominate:** The data reveals a clear split between a highly cohesive rhetorical style and a highly fragmentative one. The overall average Full Cohesion Index of -0.149 is misleading; the high standard deviation (0.670) indicates the data is not centered but clustered at two extremes, exemplified by John McCain's conciliatory concession speech and the confrontational speeches of Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Steve King.
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Forms a Coherent Meta-Strategy:** The analysis identifies a "Fragmentative Cluster" where appeals to Tribal Dominance, Fear, Enmity, and Envy are powerfully inter-correlated. For instance, Tribal Dominance and Fear show a near-perfect positive correlation (r = +0.99). This indicates that these are not isolated rhetorical choices but components of a singular, synergistic strategy aimed at mobilizing an in-group against a threatening out-group.
*   **The CFF Demonstrates Strong Construct Validity:** The framework's design is validated by the strong negative correlations between its oppositional dimensions. The data shows a powerful inverse relationship between Tribal Dominance and Individual Dignity (r = -0.67), and an exceptionally strong inverse relationship between Tribal Dominance and Compersion (r = -0.99). This confirms that the framework is effectively measuring opposing rhetorical constructs as intended.
*   **Compersion is a Keystone of Cohesive Rhetoric:** The dimension of Compersion (celebrating the legitimate success of others, including opponents) emerges as a critical differentiator. Its mean score across the corpus is exceptionally low (0.225), and its near-total absence in the three fragmentative speeches is a defining feature. As Senator John McCain stated, *"Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it..."* (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`). This type of statement is entirely absent from the other texts.
*   **Discourse is Rhetorically Simple, Not Complex:** The analysis of Rhetorical Tension Indices reveals consistently low scores (e.g., Strategic Contradiction Index mean = 0.057). This suggests the speeches do not employ sophisticated rhetorical contradiction (e.g., mixing hope and fear appeals strategically). Instead, they are straightforwardly cohesive or fragmentative, indicating a preference for clarity and directness over nuanced, multi-layered messaging in these contexts.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This study is situated at the intersection of computational social science, political communication, and democratic theory. The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) addresses a central question in the study of contemporary politics: how does the language of political actors affect social trust, polarization, and the stability of democratic institutions?

The CFF's focus on oppositional dimensions like **Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity** and **Enmity vs. Amity** directly engages with the literature on **affective polarization**, which describes the tendency of citizens to feel animosity and distrust towards members of the opposing political party, independent of policy disagreements (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012). By measuring the rhetorical inputs that may fuel such polarization, the CFF provides a tool for empirically testing theories about its linguistic drivers. For example, the high scores on `enmity` and `tribal_dominance` in some texts can be seen as the rhetorical enactment of the "othering" process central to affective polarization.

Furthermore, the framework's structure aligns with theories of **populist rhetoric**. Scholars like Cas Mudde (2004) and Benjamin Moffitt (2016) define populism as a "thin-centered ideology" that pits a virtuous, homogeneous "people" against a corrupt and self-serving "elite." This is precisely the dynamic captured by the CFF's core axes. High scores in `tribal_dominance`, `enmity`, and `envy` correspond directly to the populist strategy of constructing an in-group (the people) and an out-group (the elite or other perceived enemies). As Bernie Sanders stated, *"We will not accept an oligarchic form of society. We will not accept the richest guy in the world running all over Washington..."* (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`), which exemplifies this rhetorical construction.

Finally, the CFF's emphasis on emotion (e.g., **Hope vs. Fear**) builds on work by Ted Brader (2006) and others who have demonstrated that emotional appeals are not mere embellishments but central to political persuasion. Brader argues that appeals to enthusiasm (akin to `hope`) motivate engagement and reinforce existing loyalties, while appeals to fear stimulate vigilance and can persuade voters to reconsider their options. The CFF allows for a more nuanced analysis by measuring these appeals independently, capturing how speakers might simultaneously use fear to warn of threats and hope to inspire action, a common and powerful rhetorical combination. This study uses the CFF to map these theoretical constructs onto empirical data, providing a quantitative and qualitative assessment of their deployment in practice.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed to analyze political and social discourse. As outlined in its specification, the CFF moves beyond simple sentiment analysis by measuring language along five bipolar axes, each with a fragmentative and a cohesive pole:

1.  **Identity:** Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity
2.  **Emotion:** Fear vs. Hope
3.  **Success:** Envy vs. Compersion
4.  **Relations:** Enmity vs. Amity
5.  **Goals:** Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals

For each dimension, the framework produces a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1). This dual-scoring system allows for the measurement of complex rhetorical strategies where opposing concepts can co-exist. This analysis utilizes the statistical results generated by the CFF, including descriptive statistics, correlation matrices, and three derived indices: the **Descriptive Cohesion Index**, **Motivational Cohesion Index**, and **Full Cohesion Index**, which aggregate dimensional scores into overall measures of a text's cohesive or fragmentative orientation.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The dataset for this analysis consists of CFF scores for a small, purposively selected corpus of four American political speeches:

1.  `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`: A populist-left speech focused on economic inequality.
2.  `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`: A populist-left speech with similar themes.
3.  `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`: A populist-right speech focused on immigration and constitutional threats.
4.  `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`: A conciliatory speech following a presidential election loss.

This corpus, while not representative, was chosen to provide examples of highly distinct rhetorical styles, enabling a clear test of the CFF's discriminatory power.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis is **purely descriptive and exploratory**. Given the extremely small sample size (N=4), no inferential claims can be made, and the findings are not generalizable to a wider population of political speeches. Statistical measures, particularly the Pearson correlation coefficients, should be interpreted as descriptions of patterns *within this specific set of four documents*, not as stable, generalizable relationships.

The primary methods used are:
1.  **Interpretation of Descriptive Statistics:** Examining means and standard deviations to understand the central tendency and variance of each rhetorical dimension across the corpus.
2.  **Analysis of Derived Metrics:** Interpreting the CFF's Cohesion and Tension Indices to assess the overall rhetorical thrust and complexity of the texts.
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** Examining the Pearson correlation matrix to identify clusters of co-occurring rhetorical appeals and to assess the construct validity of the CFF's oppositional dimensions. Strong negative correlations between opposing poles (e.g., Hope vs. Fear) are treated as evidence of successful measurement.

### Limitations

The foremost limitation is the **sample size of N=4**. This constrains the analysis to identifying patterns and archetypes within this specific dataset. The correlation matrix is particularly sensitive to such a small sample and should be viewed as illustrative. The findings serve as a pilot study or proof-of-concept, generating hypotheses that would require testing on a much larger and more representative corpus of texts.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

This section details the statistical findings from the CFF analysis, integrating quantitative data with qualitative textual evidence.

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics reveal a corpus characterized by high levels of fragmentative rhetoric and significant variance across dimensions, pointing to the polarized nature of the selected texts.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Raw Scores (N=4)**

| Dimension                   | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min   | Max   |
| --------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- |
| **Fragmentative Dimensions**|       |           |       |       |
| Tribal Dominance            | 0.575 | 0.386     | 0.000 | 0.800 |
| Fear                        | 0.650 | 0.370     | 0.100 | 0.900 |
| Envy                        | 0.550 | 0.436     | 0.000 | 0.900 |
| Enmity                      | 0.650 | 0.436     | 0.000 | 0.900 |
| Fragmentative Goals         | 0.600 | 0.400     | 0.000 | 0.800 |
| **Cohesive Dimensions**     |       |           |       |       |
| Individual Dignity          | 0.425 | 0.435     | 0.000 | 0.800 |
| Hope                        | 0.475 | 0.330     | 0.000 | 0.700 |
| Compersion                  | 0.225 | 0.450     | 0.000 | 0.900 |
| Amity                       | 0.550 | 0.404     | 0.000 | 0.900 |
| Cohesive Goals              | 0.550 | 0.351     | 0.200 | 0.900 |

On average, the fragmentative dimensions of **Fear** (M=0.650) and **Enmity** (M=0.650) are the most intense appeals across the corpus. This reflects a rhetorical environment focused on threat and opposition. The high intensity of Fear is exemplified by Rep. Steve King's graphic depiction of violence, as he stated: *"This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body... It's another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here..."* (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). Similarly, the high mean for Enmity is reflected in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's identification of a malevolent force, stating: *"We are witnessing an oligarchy in America. And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price."* (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`).

In contrast, the cohesive dimensions generally show lower mean scores. The most notable is **Compersion** (M=0.225), which has the lowest average intensity of any dimension. Its high standard deviation (0.450) and range (0.0 to 0.9) indicate that its presence is highly variable; it is intense in one text (McCain's) and virtually absent in the others. This highlights the rarity of celebrating an opponent's success in this sample. The high score is driven entirely by statements like McCain's: *"In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance."* (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`). The absence of this dimension is equally telling, as noted in the analysis of Ocasio-Cortez's speech: *"No evidence found for this dimension. The speech's focus is on the illegitimate success of an oligarchy, not celebrating the success of others."* (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`).

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived Cohesion and Tension Indices provide a holistic view of the rhetorical strategies within the corpus.

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Cohesion & Tension Indices (N=4)**

| Index                           | Mean    | Std. Dev. | Min     | Max    |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ------ |
| **Cohesion Indices**            |         |           |         |        |
| Descriptive Cohesion Index      | -0.196  | 0.678     | -0.785  | 0.781  |
| Motivational Cohesion Index     | -0.139  | 0.662     | -0.692  | 0.813  |
| Full Cohesion Index             | -0.149  | 0.670     | -0.716  | 0.802  |
| **Tension Indices**             |         |           |         |        |
| Identity Tension                | 0.055   | 0.068     | 0.000   | 0.140  |
| Emotional Tension               | 0.083   | 0.074     | 0.000   | 0.150  |
| Success Tension                 | 0.000   | 0.000     | 0.000   | 0.000  |
| Relational Tension              | 0.070   | 0.095     | 0.000   | 0.200  |
| Goal Tension                    | 0.077   | 0.061     | 0.000   | 0.150  |
| Strategic Contradiction Index   | 0.057   | 0.053     | 0.008   | 0.114  |

The **Full Cohesion Index**, the most comprehensive measure, has a negative mean (-0.149), suggesting the corpus is, on balance, more fragmentative than cohesive. However, the extremely large standard deviation (0.670) relative to the mean is the most important finding here. It indicates that the texts are not clustered around a slightly negative center but are instead located at the extremes of the scale, confirming the presence of deeply divergent rhetorical archetypes.

The **Tension Indices** are uniformly low. The overall **Strategic Contradiction Index** has a mean of just 0.057. According to the CFF specification, tension measures the strategic use of opposing appeals (e.g., invoking both high hope and high fear). The low scores across the board imply that the rhetoric in this corpus is not complex or contradictory. Rather, the speeches are unambiguously one-sided: they are either highly cohesive or highly fragmentative, with little attempt to blend opposing frames. For example, a speaker doesn't pair a strong message of hope for their in-group with a nuanced acknowledgment of the out-group's perspective; instead, hope is for "us" and fear is directed at "them."

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies in the corpus. The patterns strongly validate the CFF's theoretical design and uncover two opposing meta-strategies.

**Table 3: Abridged Correlation Matrix of CFF Raw Scores and Derived Indices (N=4)**
*(Note: Due to the large size, only key correlations are presented here. Full matrix in Appendix.)*

| Variable 1         | Variable 2                  | Correlation (r) | Interpretation        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| **Framework Validity (Oppositional Pairs)** | | | |
| Tribal Dominance   | Individual Dignity          | -0.670          | Strong Negative       |
| Fear               | Hope                        | -0.559          | Moderate Negative     |
| Envy               | Compersion                  | -0.841          | Very Strong Negative  |
| Enmity             | Amity                       | -0.492          | Moderate Negative     |
| Fragmentative Goals| Cohesive Goals              | -0.664          | Strong Negative       |
| **Fragmentative Cluster** | | | |
| Tribal Dominance   | Fear                        | +0.992          | Near-Perfect Positive |
| Fear               | Enmity                      | +0.972          | Very Strong Positive  |
| Enmity             | Fragmentative Goals         | +0.994          | Near-Perfect Positive |
| **Cohesive Cluster** | | | |
| Individual Dignity | Cohesive Goals              | +0.993          | Near-Perfect Positive |
| Hope               | Amity                       | +0.836          | Very Strong Positive  |
| Amity              | Cohesive Goals              | +0.916          | Very Strong Positive  |
| **Index Correlations** | | | |
| Tribal Dominance   | Full Cohesion Index         | -0.975          | Near-Perfect Negative |
| Compersion         | Full Cohesion Index         | +0.946          | Very Strong Positive  |

The correlation matrix provides two profound insights.

First, it serves as a powerful **validation of the CFF's construct validity**. As hypothesized, each fragmentative dimension is negatively correlated with its cohesive counterpart. The relationship between Envy and Compersion (r = -0.841) is particularly strong, indicating they are measuring truly opposing concepts of success—one based on resentment of others' gains, the other on celebrating them. This confirms the framework's ability to capture the intended bipolar constructs.

Second, the matrix reveals two tightly-coupled and opposing **rhetorical meta-strategies**.
The **Fragmentative Cluster** shows that appeals to Tribal Dominance, Fear, Enmity, and Fragmentative Goals are used in near-perfect unison. A speaker invoking one is almost certain to invoke the others. This is evident in the rhetoric of Senator Sanders, who links an oligarchic tribe (`tribal_dominance`) to their destructive actions (`fear`) and the need to defeat them (`fragmentative_goals`). As he stated: *"They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer."* (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`).

The **Cohesive Cluster** operates in the opposite manner. Individual Dignity, Hope, Amity, Compersion, and Cohesive Goals are all strongly and positively inter-correlated. This strategy is best exemplified by Senator McCain's speech, which seamlessly weaves these themes together. He recognizes the dignity of a specific group (`individual_dignity`), expresses admiration for his opponent's success (`compersion`), and calls for unity (`amity`) to achieve shared national objectives (`cohesive_goals`). As he stated: *"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together..."* (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`).

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The strongest and most insightful pattern in the data is the pivotal role of the **Success Axis (Envy vs. Compersion)**. The correlation between Tribal Dominance and Compersion is an astonishingly high r = -0.99. This suggests that, in this dataset, the single best predictor of non-tribalistic rhetoric is the presence of magnanimity and the celebration of an opponent's legitimate success. Conversely, the absence of Compersion is a hallmark of fragmentative, in-group/out-group discourse. This finding has significant theoretical implications: it suggests that the capacity for non-zero-sum thinking regarding success is a lynchpin of cohesive political communication. Fragmentative rhetoric appears to rely fundamentally on a zero-sum worldview where the success of the "other" is inherently a loss for "us." This is perfectly captured by Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's statement about billionaires: *"They're not working for these billions. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me."* (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). Here, the out-group's success is framed not just as illegitimate, but as a direct theft from the in-group.

The near-perfect negative correlation between Tribal Dominance and the Full Cohesion Index (r = -0.975) is also highly significant. It demonstrates that, of all the fragmentative dimensions, the framing of politics as a struggle between competing tribes is the most powerful driver of a text's overall fragmentative score. This aligns with theories of affective polarization, where partisan identity itself becomes the primary lens through which political reality is interpreted.

An unexpected finding is the weakness of the `hope` vs. `fear` opposition (r = -0.559) compared to other pairs. This may suggest that hope and fear are not perfect opposites and can sometimes co-exist in political rhetoric more easily than, for example, amity and enmity. However, the low tension scores suggest that in this corpus, they were not used simultaneously in a sophisticated manner.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CFF proved highly effective in analyzing this corpus. Its primary strength is its **discriminatory power**. The framework did not merely find that all political speech is moderately conflictual; it precisely quantified the vast rhetorical distance between different political acts. The Full Cohesion Index ranged from a deeply fragmentative -0.716 to a highly cohesive +0.802, demonstrating its sensitivity and ability to differentiate between rhetorical archetypes.

The framework-corpus fit was excellent. The oppositional structure of the CFF is well-suited to the polarized nature of the selected speeches. The strong correlations and clear clustering suggest the framework's dimensions are capturing meaningful and coherent patterns in the data. The analysis also provides a methodological insight: the `compersion` dimension, which might seem esoteric, is in fact a uniquely powerful diagnostic tool for identifying cohesive discourse, in part because of its rarity in confrontational rhetoric. Its absence is as informative as its presence.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications and Archetypal Patterns

The findings of this analysis contribute empirical weight to theories of political communication that posit the existence of distinct, coherent rhetorical strategies. We can confidently identify two such strategies, or **archetypes**, in this data:

1.  **The Cohesive Bridge-Builder:** This archetype, exemplified by John McCain's 2008 concession speech, is defined by high scores on Amity, Compersion, Hope, and Individual Dignity. Its primary function is to de-escalate conflict, repair social fabric, and re-establish a shared national identity after a period of division. This rhetoric emphasizes shared destiny and the legitimacy of the political process, even in defeat. As McCain stated: *"Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that."* (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`). This archetype is essential for democratic resilience.

2.  **The Fragmentative Champion:** This archetype, represented by the speeches of Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and King, is defined by a unified cluster of Tribal Dominance, Fear, Enmity, and Envy. Its function is to mobilize an in-group ("the people," "working people," "constitutionalists") against a perceived existential threat posed by an out-group ("oligarchs," "billionaires," "illegal criminal aliens," "activist judges"). While the specific out-group differs—economic for Sanders/AOC, cultural/immigrant for King—the underlying rhetorical structure is identical. This structure is fundamentally populist, framing politics as a Manichaean struggle between good and evil. As Rep. King stated: *"We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that the Constitution means what they want it to mean... And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment."* (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).

The discovery of these archetypes suggests that political actors may be drawing from a limited set of coherent rhetorical playbooks. The CFF provides the tools to empirically identify which playbook is in use at any given time.

### Broader Significance and Future Directions

The broader significance of this work lies in its potential to create a more sophisticated, data-driven public discourse about the nature of our discourse. By moving beyond labels like "negative" or "positive," the CFF provides a specific vocabulary and quantitative basis for analyzing political language. This could inform journalism, civic education, and even the platforms of technology companies seeking to understand the nature of content they host.

The primary limitation of this study—its small sample size—is also its clearest direction for future research. The hypotheses generated here require rigorous testing on large, diverse, and longitudinal corpora of text. Future studies should:
*   Analyze thousands of political speeches, press releases, and social media posts to determine if the **Cohesive** and **Fragmentative** clusters hold as stable, cross-cutting meta-strategies.
*   Conduct temporal analysis to track changes in the prevalence of these archetypes over time. Is fragmentative rhetoric becoming more common?
*   Investigate the causal effects of exposure to these rhetorical archetypes on citizen attitudes, particularly affective polarization and trust in institutions, through experimental designs.
*   Explore the conditions under which politicians switch between archetypes. For example, do candidates use fragmentative rhetoric in primaries and more cohesive rhetoric in general elections?

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though exploratory, successfully demonstrates the power of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework to dissect the rhetorical architecture of political speech. The study moved beyond surface-level sentiment to reveal two deeply opposed and internally coherent meta-strategies: a **Cohesive Bridge-Builder** archetype designed to unify and a **Fragmentative Champion** archetype designed to mobilize through division.

The framework's conceptual design was strongly validated by the data, with oppositional dimensions showing the expected negative correlations. The analysis elevated the `compersion`/`envy` axis as a particularly potent indicator of rhetorical intent, suggesting that a speaker's posture towards the success of others is a keystone of their entire approach to political communication. The findings provide a robust, empirically grounded method for identifying and measuring the very language that may either strengthen or erode social cohesion and democratic health. While the conclusions drawn from this small sample are illustrative, they lay the groundwork for future large-scale research and offer a new lens through which to understand the profound impact of political discourse.
