    "analysis_notes": "The document is a highly rhetorical political speech. The analysis focused on the explicit framing of a class-based conflict between 'oligarchs/billionaires' and 'working people'. The speaker uses strong, often oppositional language, making most dimensions clearly present and salient. The primary challenge was distinguishing between the speaker's own goals and the goals she attributes to her opponents, which was handled by scoring both as present in the discourse."
