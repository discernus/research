    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic political concession speech, characterized by its gracious tone, calls for unity, and praise for the victor. This makes the scoring of the dimensions relatively straightforward. The rhetoric strongly aligns with the 'cohesive' dimensions of the framework (Individual Dignity, Hope, Compersion, Amity, Cohesive Goals) and shows a marked absence of the 'fragmentative' dimensions. The salience scores reflect the speech's primary purpose: to unify the country after a divisive election."
