    "analysis_notes": "Analysis of a political speech by AOC from the 2020s, focusing on economic policy and social commentary. The speech frames a clear 'us vs. them' narrative (working class/people vs. oligarchy/wealthy/certain politicians) while simultaneously emphasizing internal unity and inclusive solidarity within the 'us' group. Strong emotional appeals, particularly fear of current conditions and hope for a better future through collective action, are present. The success of the 'other' is consistently delegitimized as stolen or ill-gotten."
