The speech strongly delineates an 'in-group' (the working class) and an 'out-group' (the oligarchy), attributing malicious intent and illegitimate success to the latter. The primary rhetorical strategy is to foster in-group solidarity (Amity, Cohesive Goals) to fight an external enemy (Enmity, Fragmentative Goals)."
