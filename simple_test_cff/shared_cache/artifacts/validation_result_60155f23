    "The machine-readable appendix of the experiment specification includes a 'questions' field. This field is not defined in the Experiment Specification v10.0 standard. Research questions must be defined exclusively in the human-readable narrative part of the document.",
    "The framework's human-readable narrative refers to 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework (v10.0)', but the machine-readable appendix specifies 'framework_version: \"10.2\"'. This is a minor version inconsistency between the prose and the configuration.",
    "The research goal of comparing 'institutional' vs. 'populist' styles is statistically limited by the corpus composition. The 'institutional' group contains only one document (N=1), which, per Discernus v10.0 standards, prevents inferential statistical tests like ANOVA that require group sizes of N>=2."
