It employs a populist, class-based framing that strongly polarizes a 'working class' in-group against an 'oligarch' out-group. This makes dimensions like Tribal Dominance, Envy, and Enmity highly intense and salient. Conversely, opposing dimensions like Compersion are entirely absent. The speech strategically combines strong negative framing of the problem (Fear, Envy) with a strong call for in-group solidarity (Amity, Cohesive Goals) to motivate action.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribal_dominance\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"individual_dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.2,\n          \"salience\": 0.2,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"envy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"compersion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"enmity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"amity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"fragmentative_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"cohesive_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.85\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribal_dominance\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country and they derive their power from dividing working people apart.
