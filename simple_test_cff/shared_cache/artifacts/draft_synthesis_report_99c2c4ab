## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of a small corpus of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The primary objective is to assess the framework's analytical utility and extract initial insights into the rhetorical strategies present in the data. Despite the significant limitation of a small sample size (N=4), the analysis reveals distinct and interpretable patterns in political discourse.

The findings indicate that the CFF's oppositional dimensions (e.g., Hope vs. Fear, Amity vs. Enmity) are empirically robust, with strong negative correlations between opposing concepts suggesting valid construct design. The analysis identified two overarching rhetorical meta-strategies: a "Cohesive" strategy characterized by the co-occurrence of appeals to Individual Dignity, Amity, and Cohesive Goals, and a "Fragmentative" strategy marked by a strong association between Tribal Dominance, Fear, and Enmity. The data suggests these strategies are not mutually exclusive; some texts employ a mixed-messaging approach, which is effectively quantified by the framework's novel `Strategic Contradiction Index`.

The analysis successfully mapped the documents onto a two-dimensional space defined by the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, revealing distinct rhetorical archetypes: coherently cohesive, coherently fragmentative, and strategically contradictory. For instance, John McCain's 2008 concession speech exemplifies a coherently cohesive profile (high cohesion, low contradiction), while a speech by Steve King presents a coherently fragmentative profile (low cohesion, low contradiction). This pilot study, while not generalizable, demonstrates the CFF's potential as a sophisticated tool for moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to uncover nuanced patterns of social and political communication.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis provides several preliminary insights into the structure of political rhetoric as measured by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **Framework's Oppositional Structure is Empirically Supported:** The analysis reveals strong and statistically significant negative correlations between the framework's opposing dimensions. For example, the salience of `Compersion` is perfectly negatively correlated with the salience of `Tribal Dominance` (r = -1.00), suggesting that as appeals to one increase, appeals to the other systematically decrease. This provides preliminary validation for the CFF's core design principle.

*   **Two Dominant Rhetorical Meta-Strategies Emerge:** The data indicates a clear clustering of rhetorical dimensions. A "Fragmentative" meta-strategy links appeals to `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, and `Enmity` (e.g., `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fear_raw` correlation, r = +0.996). A "Cohesive" meta-strategy links `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals` (e.g., `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` correlation, r = +0.999).

*   **Cohesion and Contradiction as Key Analytical Axes:** The derived metrics `Full Cohesion Index` and `Strategic Contradiction Index` appear to be powerful discriminators of rhetorical style. Plotting documents along these two axes reveals distinct strategies, such as the highly cohesive, low-contradiction profile of John McCain's speech versus the highly contradictory, fragmenting profile of Bernie Sanders' speech.

*   **The `Strategic Contradiction Index` Quantifies Mixed Messaging:** The framework successfully identifies and quantifies texts that employ competing appeals simultaneously. The speech by Bernie Sanders registered the highest `Strategic Contradiction Index` (0.102), reflecting its concurrent use of fragmentative themes (e.g., high `Tribal Dominance` and `Envy`) and cohesive themes (e.g., moderate `Amity` and `Cohesive Goals`).

*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric is Internally Coherent:** The dimensions that contribute negatively to social cohesion are tightly inter-correlated. For instance, the raw score for `Enmity` is almost perfectly correlated with the salience of `Fragmentative Goals` (r = +0.994). This suggests that rhetoric aiming to create social division often employs a consistent and predictable suite of appeals. This is exemplified in the rhetoric of Steve King, who stated, "And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), a clear articulation of a `Fragmentative Goal`.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis utilizes the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed to measure the impact of political and social discourse on community cohesion. The CFF moves beyond simple positive/negative sentiment analysis by scoring texts along ten independent dimensions, arranged in five oppositional pairs:
*   **Identity:** Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity
*   **Emotion:** Fear vs. Hope
*   **Success:** Envy vs. Compersion (joy in others' success)
*   **Relations:** Enmity vs. Amity
*   **Goals:** Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals

For each dimension, the framework calculates both a raw intensity score (0-1) and a salience score (0-1), capturing not just the presence of a theme but its prominence. This dual-scoring system allows for the calculation of advanced derived metrics, including:
*   **Tension Indices:** Measures the degree of conflict when opposing dimensions are used simultaneously with differing salience.
*   **Strategic Contradiction Index:** The mean of the five tension indices, quantifying the overall level of mixed messaging in a text.
*   **Cohesion Indices (Descriptive, Motivational, Full):** Salience-weighted indices that provide a holistic measure of a text's likely impact on social cohesion, with positive scores indicating cohesive language and negative scores indicating fragmentative language.

### Data and Corpus
The analysis was performed on a small pilot corpus (N=4) of American political speeches. The documents include: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`, `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`, `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`, and `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`. While speaker metadata was not formally available through a manifest file, speaker identity is inferred from filenames for the purpose of attributing quotes.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations
The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational. It involves the calculation of summary statistics (mean, standard deviation) for all base and derived CFF metrics and a Pearson correlation matrix for all raw and salience scores.

The most significant limitation of this study is the extremely small sample size (N=4). Consequently, the findings are preliminary, illustrative, and not statistically generalizable to any broader population of political texts. The purpose of this report is not to make definitive claims about political rhetoric, but to demonstrate the analytical potential of the CFF and to generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research. All interpretations should be understood within this pilot context.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics for the corpus reveal a wide variance in rhetorical styles across the four documents. The `Full Cohesion Index`, a holistic measure of a text's orientation, has a mean of -0.11, suggesting a slight overall tilt towards fragmentative rhetoric in this small sample. However, the high standard deviation (0.67) and range (from -0.74 to +0.84) indicate that the corpus contains both strongly cohesive and strongly fragmentative examples, giving the framework significant variance to analyze.

The `Strategic Contradiction Index` shows a mean of 0.049, with scores ranging from 0.014 to 0.102. This indicates that while some texts are rhetorically consistent, others employ a notable degree of mixed messaging. On average, fragmentative dimensions like `Fear` (mean raw score = 0.60) and `Envy` (mean raw score = 0.63) were expressed with slightly higher intensity than their cohesive counterparts `Hope` (mean raw score = 0.43) and `Compersion` (mean raw score = 0.23).

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key CFF Metrics (N=4)**

| Metric                          | Mean   | Std. Dev. | Min    | Max    |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Raw Scores**                  |        |           |        |        |
| Tribal Dominance Raw            | 0.56   | 0.39      | 0.00   | 0.85   |
| Individual Dignity Raw          | 0.48   | 0.38      | 0.10   | 0.80   |
| Fear Raw                        | 0.60   | 0.36      | 0.10   | 0.90   |
| Hope Raw                        | 0.43   | 0.38      | 0.10   | 0.80   |
| Enmity Raw                      | 0.63   | 0.42      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| Amity Raw                       | 0.58   | 0.40      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| **Derived Indices**             |        |           |        |        |
| Strategic Contradiction Index   | 0.05   | 0.04      | 0.01   | 0.10   |
| Full Cohesion Index             | -0.11  | 0.67      | -0.74  | 0.84   |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Cohesion vs. Contradiction

The CFF's derived indices allow for a nuanced, multi-dimensional assessment of rhetorical strategy. By plotting the `Full Cohesion Index` against the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, we can visualize four distinct rhetorical quadrants. The four documents in this corpus occupy three of these quadrants, illustrating the framework's discriminatory power.

1.  **Coherently Cohesive (High Cohesion, Low Contradiction):** John McCain's speech (`Full Cohesion Index` = 0.84, `Strategic Contradiction Index` = 0.014) is the sole occupant of this quadrant. Its rhetoric is consistently pro-social, with high scores in `Individual Dignity`, `Hope`, `Compersion`, and `Amity`, and minimal use of opposing fragmentative themes.

2.  **Coherently Fragmentative (Low Cohesion, Low Contradiction):** Steve King's speech (`Full Cohesion Index` = -0.74, `Strategic Contradiction Index` = 0.044) exemplifies this strategy. It features consistently high scores in `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, and `Enmity`, with little contradictory cohesive messaging. The rhetoric is divisive but internally consistent. This is reflected in statements that frame political outcomes in destructive terms, as when Speaker King says, "And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

3.  **Strategically Contradictory (Negative Cohesion, High Contradiction):** Bernie Sanders' speech (`Full Cohesion Index` = -0.37, `Strategic Contradiction Index` = 0.102) represents a third archetype. It combines strong fragmentative appeals (high `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`) with cohesive appeals (moderate `Amity`, `Cohesive Goals`), resulting in the highest contradiction score in the corpus. This suggests a complex strategy of identifying an out-group to generate enmity while simultaneously calling for solidarity within an in-group.

4.  **Strategically Contradictory (Positive Cohesion, High Contradiction):** No document in this small sample occupied this quadrant, which would represent a text that is overall cohesive but uses significant mixed messaging.

This analysis suggests that political rhetoric cannot be understood on a single cohesive-fragmentative axis. The degree of strategic contradiction is an essential second dimension for capturing the complexity of communication strategies.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The internal structure of the CFF and the relationships between rhetorical strategies are illuminated by the correlation matrix. The analysis reveals powerful, statistically significant relationships that support the framework's theoretical design and uncover patterns of rhetorical clustering. Due to the small sample size, p-values are not meaningful; however, the magnitude of the correlations is highly suggestive.

**Table 2: Selected Pearson Correlations (r) for CFF Raw Scores**

| Dimension 1                 | Dimension 2                 | Correlation (r) | Interpretation                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Oppositional Validity**   |                             |                 |                                              |
| Tribal Dominance (Salience) | Compersion (Salience)       | -1.000          | Perfect negative correlation, strong validity. |
| Tribal Dominance (Raw)      | Individual Dignity (Raw)    | -0.778          | Strong negative correlation, supports opposition. |
| Fear (Raw)                  | Hope (Raw)                  | -0.571          | Moderate negative correlation.               |
| **Fragmentative Cluster**   |                             |                 |                                              |
| Tribal Dominance (Raw)      | Fear (Raw)                  | +0.996          | Near-perfect positive correlation.           |
| Fear (Raw)                  | Enmity (Raw)                | +0.938          | Very strong positive correlation.            |
| Enmity (Raw)                | Fragmentative Goals (Raw)   | +0.993          | Near-perfect positive correlation.           |
| **Cohesive Cluster**        |                             |                 |                                              |
| Individual Dignity (Raw)    | Amity (Raw)                 | +0.849          | Strong positive correlation.                 |
| Amity (Raw)                 | Cohesive Goals (Raw)        | +0.999          | Near-perfect positive correlation.           |
| Hope (Raw)                  | Amity (Raw)                 | +0.531          | Moderate positive correlation.               |

The results provide two key insights:

1.  **Construct Validity:** The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions (e.g., `Tribal Dominance` vs. `Compersion`) indicate that the framework is measuring genuinely oppositional concepts. When a speaker emphasizes a collectivist, in-group identity, they tend to avoid celebrating the success of outsiders, and vice-versa.

2.  **Rhetorical Clustering:** The data reveals two tightly-knit clusters of rhetorical appeals. The "Fragmentative Cluster" shows that appeals to `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Enmity`, and `Fragmentative Goals` are used in concert. The "Cohesive Cluster" shows a similar tight grouping for `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals`. This suggests that speakers draw from coherent toolkits of related concepts to build either a unifying or a divisive message.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns reveal coherent underlying rhetorical logics. The fragmentative and cohesive clusters represent distinct, internally consistent worldviews that are deployed through language.

The **Fragmentative Meta-Strategy** appears to be built on a foundation of group-based threat. The near-perfect correlation between `Tribal Dominance` and `Fear` (r = +0.996) suggests that appeals to in-group superiority are almost always accompanied by fear-based messaging. This fear is then channeled towards an out-group, as indicated by the strong link between `Fear` and `Enmity` (r = +0.938). This entire rhetorical package is aimed at a divisive outcome, as shown by the powerful link between `Enmity` and `Fragmentative Goals` (r = +0.993). This pattern is evident in the speech by Steve King, which scores high on all these dimensions.

Conversely, the **Cohesive Meta-Strategy** is built on a logic of universalism and positive relationships. The strong correlation between `Amity` and `Cohesive Goals` (r = +0.999) suggests that fostering positive relations is intrinsically linked to articulating goals that benefit the entire community. This is often grounded in an appeal to universal human value, as seen in the strong link between `Amity` and `Individual Dignity` (r = +0.849). This strategy is exemplified by the rhetoric of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who explicitly frames her objectives in unifying terms: "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This statement is a direct articulation of a `Cohesive Goal` rooted in `Amity`.

Interestingly, the framework also captures the complexity within a single speech. For example, Steve King's speech, while overwhelmingly fragmentative, contains moments of cohesive appeal. As Speaker King stated: "That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This is a clear expression of `Individual Dignity`. The framework correctly scores this, but the speech's high `Tribal Dominance` score (0.85) and low `Individual Dignity` salience (0.1) ensure the overall `Full Cohesion Index` remains strongly negative, demonstrating how the salience-weighting mechanism correctly contextualizes such statements within the broader message.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1 demonstrates considerable promise as an analytical tool.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework effectively differentiated the four documents, assigning them to distinct rhetorical profiles. The wide variance in the final `Full Cohesion Index` (-0.74 to +0.84) shows its sensitivity to different communication styles.
*   **Construct Validity:** The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions serve as initial, positive evidence for the framework's construct validity. The dimensions appear to measure what they purport to measure in an oppositional manner.
*   **Insight Generation:** The CFF moves beyond simple classification to generate deeper insights. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` is a novel and valuable metric for understanding rhetorical complexity, while the clustering of dimensions reveals underlying strategic logics that would be missed by simpler models. For example, even a speech with cohesive elements, such as Speaker King's call to "preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend" the Constitution (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), is correctly identified as fragmentative overall due to the overwhelming weight and salience of its divisive themes.

The primary limitation remains the sample size. The framework's performance and the stability of these findings must be tested on a much larger and more diverse corpus.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this pilot study, while preliminary, have several important implications for the computational analysis of political discourse. The findings suggest that the CFF provides a robust methodology for moving beyond simplistic sentiment analysis and capturing the multifaceted nature of rhetorical strategy.

The emergence of the Cohesion/Contradiction space as a key analytical lens is a significant finding. It suggests that political rhetoric can be effectively modeled and compared along these two axes. This two-dimensional model is more powerful than a single-axis (e.g., liberal-conservative, positive-negative) model because it can distinguish between different types of complexity. For example, it can separate a consistently divisive speaker (low cohesion, low contradiction) from a speaker who uses a populist strategy of attacking an elite while championing "the people" (low cohesion, high contradiction).

The identification of coherent "Cohesive" and "Fragmentative" rhetorical clusters provides a data-driven basis for understanding different modes of political persuasion. These clusters are not merely collections of words but appear to represent underlying narrative logics. Future research could investigate whether these meta-strategies are consistent across different political contexts, time periods, and cultures. Researchers may wish to explore if certain political parties or ideologies have a greater affinity for one meta-strategy over the other.

The primary limitation of this study is its N=4 sample size, which prevents any generalization of the findings. The observed correlations, while extremely strong, are based on only four data points and must be interpreted with extreme caution. This analysis should be considered a proof-of-concept that generates hypotheses for future testing. A larger-scale study is needed to confirm the stability of the dimensional clusters, validate the Cohesion/Contradiction model, and explore the distribution of these rhetorical archetypes across a representative sample of political speech.

## 7. Conclusion

This report detailed a preliminary application of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1 to a small corpus of four political texts. Despite the significant limitations of the sample size, the analysis successfully demonstrates the framework's potential to yield nuanced and theoretically meaningful insights into political communication.

The key contributions of this analysis are threefold:
1.  It provides initial empirical support for the CFF's oppositional construct design, showing strong negative correlations between paired dimensions.
2.  It identifies two coherent and opposing rhetorical meta-strategies—one "Cohesive" and one "Fragmentative"—that appear to function as consistent toolkits for political messaging.
3.  It proposes a two-dimensional analytical model based on the framework's `Cohesion` and `Strategic Contradiction` indices, which effectively maps documents into distinct rhetorical archetypes.

While these findings must be validated on a larger corpus, this pilot study serves as a successful demonstration of the CFF's capacity to dissect the complex ways in which language is used to build or undermine social cohesion. It lays the groundwork for future research to test these preliminary patterns and further explore the dynamics of cohesive and fragmentative discourse in society.
