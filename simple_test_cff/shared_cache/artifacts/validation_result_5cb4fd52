    "The research questions in the scholarly narrative of the experiment file ('What are the baseline cohesion and tension scores for the documents in the sample corpus?') differ significantly from the question specified in the machine-readable YAML appendix ('Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion than populist styles?'). The narrative question is descriptive, while the YAML question is comparative and analytical.",
    "The framework specification exhibits internal version inconsistency. The filename is `cff_v10.md`, the scholarly document is titled 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1', and the machine-readable appendix specifies `framework_version: '10.2'`. All three should be consistent.",
    "The experiment aims to conduct a comparative analysis between discourse styles, but the corpus contains only four documents (N=4). According to Discernus validation standards, a sample size of N<10 is only suitable for case study analysis and identifying qualitative patterns, not for statistically significant comparisons."
