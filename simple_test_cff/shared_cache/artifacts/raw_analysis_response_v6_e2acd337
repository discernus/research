The speaker's primary goals are to acknowledge defeat gracefully, affirm the legitimacy of the outcome, and call for national unity. This makes the speech a strong example of dimensions like Amity, Compersion, and Cohesive Goals, while being almost entirely devoid of their counterparts (Enmity, Envy, Fragmentative Goals)."
