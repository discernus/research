    "analysis_notes": "The document is a clear example of populist, class-based political rhetoric. The core narrative is a stark 'us vs. them' conflict, pitting 'the American people' against a 'billionaire oligarchy.' This leads to high scores in dimensions reflecting conflict and grievance (Tribal Dominance, Envy, Enmity, Fragmentative Goals). The opposing cohesive dimensions are present but function primarily as a call for in-group solidarity to achieve the antagonistic goals, rather than as universal principles."
