The first section frames a procedural political dispute (a Supreme Court nomination) in existential terms of constitutional survival. The second, more dominant section pivots to immigration, using highly graphic and emotional victim narratives to evoke fear and anger, framing immigrants as a hostile out-group and the current administration as an adversary enabling them. The rhetorical strategy is clear and maps well to the framework's dimensions, particularly those related to fear, enmity, and tribalism. Cohesive dimensions are almost entirely absent.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribal_dominance\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"individual_dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.2,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"envy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"compersion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"enmity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"amity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"fragmentative_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"cohesive_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.2,\n          \"salience\": 0.3,\n          \"confidence\": 0.85\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribal_dominance\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"That's 135 dead Americans that would be alive today if the President didn't have the policy of releasing criminal, criminal aliens onto the streets.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"Policy Critique\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"individual_dignity\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"Absence of Evidence\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"fear\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body.
