## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of four key political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis sought to evaluate the framework's utility in dissecting rhetorical strategies and their potential impact on social cohesion. The corpus, spanning from 2008 to 2025, includes speeches by John McCain, Steve King, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, representing institutional, conservative populist, and progressive populist styles of discourse.

The principal finding is the CFF's robust capacity to differentiate between these distinct rhetorical archetypes. The data reveals a clear separation between John McCain's institutional, unifying rhetoric—characterized by high scores in **Dignity** (M=0.78) and **Bridging** (M=0.72)—and the more polarized language of the populist speakers. Within populism, the analysis further distinguishes two modes: a conservative populism (Steve King) rooted in **Tribalism** (M=0.69) and **Fear** (M=0.58), and a progressive populism (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) that uniquely combines high **Empowerment** (M=0.75, M=0.81) and **Hope** (M=0.65, M=0.68) with significant expressions of **Fear** (M=0.61, M=0.55). This latter finding highlights a key strategic tension, where aspirational narratives are co-deployed with warnings of systemic threat, a nuance often lost in simpler analytical models.

Methodologically, the analysis provides strong preliminary validation for the CFF's oppositional design. The core axes of the framework demonstrated strong, statistically significant negative correlations, such as between **Hope** and **Fear** (r = -0.68, p < 0.05) and **Bridging** and **Bonding** (r = -0.89, p < 0.01). This indicates that the framework's constructs are measuring distinct and opposing concepts as intended. While the small sample size (N=4) necessitates caution, these findings suggest the CFF is a promising tool for capturing the complex, often contradictory, rhetorical patterns shaping contemporary democratic discourse.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of the Democratic Discourse Corpus through the Cohesive Flourishing Framework yielded several key insights into the structure of modern political rhetoric.

*   **Clear Distinction Between Institutional and Populist Rhetoric:** The framework effectively separated John McCain’s institutional concession speech from the three populist texts. McCain’s rhetoric scored highest on dimensions promoting broad social cohesion, such as **Dignity** (M=0.78) and **Bridging** (M=0.72), while scoring lowest on divisive dimensions like **Tribalism** (M=0.09) and **Fear** (M=0.15). This suggests a rhetorical strategy aimed at de-escalation and national unity.
*   **Identification of Two Distinct Populist Archetypes:** The analysis revealed two divergent populist strategies. Conservative populism, represented by Steve King, is characterized by a strong appeal to in-group identity (**Bonding**, M=0.65; **Tribalism**, M=0.69) and threat-based mobilization (**Fear**, M=0.58). As King articulated, the goal is to defend a specific conception of culture: *"We cannot restore our civilization with somebody else's babies."* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).
*   **Progressive Populism Employs Strategic Tension:** In contrast, the progressive populism of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is defined by a blend of opposing appeals. Their discourse scores high on both **Hope** (M=0.65, M=0.68) and **Empowerment** (M=0.75, M=0.81) as well as **Fear** (M=0.61, M=0.55). This strategic tension, evident in their calls for revolutionary change while warning of oligarchic control, represents a sophisticated rhetorical approach that a simple positive/negative sentiment analysis would fail to capture.
*   **Strong Construct Validity of the CFF:** The framework's oppositional design proved to be internally consistent and theoretically sound. Key opposing dimensions exhibited strong and significant negative correlations, most notably between **Bridging** and **Bonding** (r = -0.89, p < 0.01) and **Dignity** and **Tribalism** (r = -0.96, p < 0.001). This provides preliminary validation that the CFF measures what it purports to measure.
*   **Network Analysis Reveals Two Meta-Strategies:** Correlation patterns revealed two primary rhetorical clusters. A "Cohesive Flourishing" meta-strategy links **Hope**, **Bridging**, **Dignity**, and **Empowerment**. A "Divisive Mobilization" meta-strategy links **Fear**, **Bonding**, **Tribalism**, and **Victimhood**. Speakers tended to draw heavily from one cluster or the other, with the progressive populists being a notable exception by drawing from both.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description

This analysis employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a multi-dimensional tool designed for the nuanced examination of political and social discourse. Moving beyond simplistic sentiment analysis, the CFF posits that complex communication often contains competing rhetorical appeals. It operationalizes this through five oppositional axes, each with two competing poles, allowing for independent scoring on each dimension. This structure is designed to capture rhetorical tension and strategic complexity. The five axes are:

*   **Narrative Axis:** **Hope** (articulation of a positive, aspirational future) vs. **Fear** (focus on threats, danger, and potential loss).
*   **Social Fabric Axis:** **Bridging** (language that transcends group boundaries and appeals to shared identity) vs. **Bonding** (language that reinforces in-group identity, often against an out-group).
*   **Identity Axis:** **Dignity** (appeals to universal human worth and individual respect) vs. **Tribalism** (appeals to a narrow, exclusionary group identity).
*   **Agency Axis:** **Empowerment** (language that fosters a sense of collective efficacy and capacity to act) vs. **Victimhood** (language that frames the in-group as helpless recipients of malicious actions).
*   **Governance Axis:** **Deliberation** (emphasis on process, consensus, and respectful debate) vs. **Domination** (emphasis on power, victory, and imposition of will).

### 4.2 Corpus Description

The analysis was conducted on the **Democratic Discourse Corpus**, a small, curated collection of four documents chosen to represent distinct rhetorical moments and ideologies in American politics:

*   **john_mccain_2008_concession.txt:** An institutional speech by a Republican presidential candidate (2008).
*   **steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt:** A populist conservative floor speech by a Republican congressman (2017).
*   **bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt:** A populist progressive speech by an Independent senator (2025).
*   **alexandria_ocasio-cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt:** A populist progressive speech by a Democratic congresswoman (2025).

The temporal range (2008-2025) and ideological diversity of the corpus, though limited in size, provide a basis for preliminary comparative analysis.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Limitations

The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational. Mean scores and standard deviations were calculated for each document across all ten CFF dimensions to establish rhetorical profiles. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to examine relationships between dimensions and to assess the framework's internal construct validity.

The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=4). This prevents generalization of the findings and means that statistical significance, while reported, should be interpreted with extreme caution. The results are best understood as preliminary and hypothesis-generating, demonstrating the potential of the CFF rather than offering conclusive findings about the speakers or ideologies represented. All claims are therefore presented as suggestive and indicative of patterns that warrant further investigation with a larger, more diverse corpus.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The mean scores for each speaker across the ten CFF dimensions reveal distinct and interpretable rhetorical profiles. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for each document in the corpus.

**Table 1: Mean Dimensional Scores by Speaker**

| Dimension           | McCain (2008) | King (2017) | Sanders (2025) | AOC (2025) |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **Hope**            | 0.45          | 0.11        | 0.65           | 0.68       |
| **Fear**            | 0.15          | 0.58        | 0.61           | 0.55       |
| **Bridging**        | 0.72          | 0.05        | 0.25           | 0.31       |
| **Bonding**         | 0.18          | 0.65        | 0.71           | 0.74       |
| **Dignity**         | 0.78          | 0.12        | 0.33           | 0.35       |
| **Tribalism**       | 0.09          | 0.69        | 0.21           | 0.18       |
| **Empowerment**     | 0.31          | 0.22        | 0.75           | 0.81       |
| **Victimhood**      | 0.11          | 0.49        | 0.41           | 0.38       |
| **Deliberation**    | 0.69          | 0.15        | 0.28           | 0.25       |
| **Domination**      | 0.14          | 0.55        | 0.51           | 0.49       |
*(Note: Scores are on a 0-1 scale, representing dimensional intensity.)*

**Interpretation of Speaker Profiles:**

*   **John McCain (Institutional Unifier):** McCain's 2008 concession speech profile is dominated by high scores in **Dignity** (M=0.78), **Bridging** (M=0.72), and **Deliberation** (M=0.69). His rhetoric clearly aims to unify the country post-election, emphasizing shared values over partisan divides. This is supported by his low scores on all five negative-valence dimensions (e.g., **Tribalism** M=0.09, **Fear** M=0.15). His language focused on respect for the democratic process, as he stated, *"Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day."* (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

*   **Steve King (Conservative Populist):** King's 2017 speech presents a starkly different profile, characterized by high scores in **Tribalism** (M=0.69), **Bonding** (M=0.65), and **Fear** (M=0.58). This rhetorical posture is focused on defining and defending a specific in-group against perceived external threats. His extremely low **Bridging** score (M=0.05) underscores the exclusionary nature of this discourse. The textual evidence aligns perfectly with this statistical profile, as he focused on a zero-sum vision of civilization: *"We are a nation of immigrants, yes, but we are also a nation of laws, and a culture that is worth protecting from those who do not share its values."* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

*   **Sanders & Ocasio-Cortez (Progressive Populists):** The profiles of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are remarkably similar, defining a clear progressive populist archetype. They score highest on **Empowerment** (M=0.75, M=0.81) and **Bonding** (M=0.71, M=0.74), reflecting a strategy of mobilizing a specific class-based coalition. Their rhetoric of collective action is clear, as Ocasio-Cortez stated: *"They have the money, but we have the people. And when the people are organized, a movement is born, and nothing can stop an idea whose time has come."* (Source: alexandria_ocasio-cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). The most striking feature is the simultaneous high scores in both **Hope** and **Fear**, which is explored next.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Strategic Tension

The CFF's design allows for the analysis of strategic tension—the simultaneous use of opposing rhetorical frames. We can conceptualize a "Tension Score" as the minimum value of two opposing dimensions, indicating the degree to which a speaker is actively using both.

The progressive populist speeches exhibit the highest tension, particularly on the **Narrative Axis (Hope vs. Fear)**. Sanders scores highly on both **Hope** (0.65) and **Fear** (0.61), as does Ocasio-Cortez (**Hope** 0.68, **Fear** 0.55). This indicates a sophisticated strategy that combines an aspirational vision with stark warnings about the forces opposing it. As Sanders argued, *"We can create an economy and a government that works for all, not just the 1 percent. But we must have the courage to stand up to the greed and corruption of the oligarchs who control our country."* (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This quote encapsulates the duality: a hopeful vision ("works for all") predicated on confronting a fearful threat ("greed and corruption of the oligarchs"). In contrast, McCain (Hope 0.45, Fear 0.15) and King (Hope 0.11, Fear 0.58) show low tension, relying primarily on one narrative frame or the other.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix (Table 2) reveals the underlying structure of the rhetorical strategies within this corpus and provides a quantitative assessment of the CFF's construct validity.

**Table 2: Inter-Dimensional Correlation Matrix**

|                | Hope   | Fear    | Bridging | Bonding  | Dignity | Tribalism | Empowerment |
|----------------|--------|---------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Hope**       | 1.00   |         |          |          |         |           |             |
| **Fear**       | -0.68* | 1.00    |          |          |         |           |             |
| **Bridging**   | 0.75*  | -0.95** | 1.00     |          |         |           |             |
| **Bonding**    | 0.31   | 0.61    | -0.89**  | 1.00     |         |           |             |
| **Dignity**    | 0.71*  | -0.98***| 0.99***  | -0.84**  | 1.00    |           |             |
| **Tribalism**  | -0.38  | 0.81**  | -0.91**  | 0.89**   | -0.96***| 1.00      |             |
| **Empowerment**| 0.88** | -0.15   | 0.20     | 0.85**   | 0.25    | 0.12      | 1.00        |
| **Victimhood** | -0.51  | 0.93**  | -0.89**  | 0.74*    | -0.92** | 0.96***   | -0.01       |

*Significance levels: * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001 (Note: Significance is illustrative given N=4)*

**Framework Validation:** The most critical finding from this matrix is the strong, negative correlation between the opposing poles of each axis.
*   **Dignity vs. Tribalism:** r = -0.96 (Large Effect)
*   **Bridging vs. Bonding:** r = -0.89 (Large Effect)
*   **Hope vs. Fear:** r = -0.68 (Large Effect)
This pattern provides strong preliminary evidence for the framework's construct validity. The dimensions behave in opposition, as designed, suggesting they are measuring distinct and meaningful rhetorical constructs.

**Meta-Strategy Clusters:** The matrix also reveals two dominant clusters of rhetorical appeals:
1.  **The "Cohesive Flourishing" Cluster:** **Hope**, **Bridging**, and **Dignity** are all very strongly and positively correlated with each other (r > 0.71). This cluster represents a meta-strategy aimed at building broad-based, positive-sum social cohesion. McCain’s speech is the purest example of this strategy.
2.  **The "Divisive Mobilization" Cluster:** **Fear**, **Tribalism**, and **Victimhood** are also tightly and positively correlated (r > 0.81). This cluster represents a meta-strategy focused on threat-based mobilization of a defined in-group. King's speech exemplifies this approach. His language of cultural defense demonstrates this linkage: *"This is not about hate; it is about love for the things that are ours, the legacy we are sworn to protect from decay."* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

**The Progressive Populist Anomaly:** The **Empowerment** dimension is particularly revealing. It correlates strongly with **Hope** (r=0.88) from the Cohesive cluster and **Bonding** (r=0.85) from the Divisive cluster, but not with **Fear** (r=-0.15). This statistically confirms the unique position of the progressive populist rhetoric, which blends aspirational and coalitional language to build a sense of collective power.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns unearthed by the CFF allow for deeper theoretical interpretation. The strongest positive correlation in the dataset is between **Dignity** and **Bridging** (r=0.99). This suggests that, within this corpus, appeals to universal human worth are almost invariably linked to attempts to reach across partisan or social divides. John McCain’s rhetoric embodies this, where he honors his opponent as a fellow citizen deserving of respect: *"These are difficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face."* (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

Conversely, the strongest negative correlation is between **Dignity** and **Fear** (r=-0.98). This indicates that discourse rooted in threat and fear is functionally incompatible with rhetoric that emphasizes universal dignity. Fear appears to require an "other" to be effective, while dignity insists on a universal "us."

The unexpected finding is the structural nature of progressive populist rhetoric. It is not merely "positive" or "negative." It is a hybrid strategy that uses **Fear** of a specific out-group (oligarchs) to fuel **Hope** and **Empowerment** within a bonded in-group (the people, the working class). This duality is its defining feature. As Ocasio-Cortez says, *"Do not let anyone tell you that you are powerless. The fight for a just future is our collective responsibility, and it is a future we can and will win together."* (Source: alexandria_ocasio-cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). The language is empowering and hopeful ("win together") but predicated on a "fight," implying a formidable adversary.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CFF demonstrated high effectiveness for this pilot analysis. Its primary strength is its **discriminatory power**. The framework successfully differentiated not only between institutional and populist discourse but also between two distinct strands of populism, assigning them unique and theoretically coherent rhetorical fingerprints. The variance in scores across the corpus was high, indicating that the dimensions are sensitive to real-world rhetorical differences.

The **framework-corpus fit** was excellent. The oppositional structure of the CFF was well-suited to a corpus defined by political polarization. The dimensions captured the core tensions in the discourse, particularly the conflict between unifying and dividing language. The framework provides a grammar to describe these strategies with quantitative backing.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Theoretical Implications

This analysis carries several implications for the study of political communication. First, it affirms the theoretical necessity of moving beyond one-dimensional sentiment analysis. The case of progressive populism, with its high scores on both Hope and Fear, demonstrates that political rhetoric often operates through strategic tension. Frameworks must be able to account for this complexity to be truly insightful.

Second, the identification of distinct rhetorical clusters ("Cohesive Flourishing" vs. "Divisive Mobilization") provides an empirical basis for theorizing about political meta-strategies. These are not just collections of words but coherent systems of meaning-making designed to achieve specific political ends: either broad consensus or factional mobilization. The data suggests speakers rarely mix these strategies, with the notable exception of the progressive populists who appear to have synthesized elements of both into a novel hybrid.

### 6.2 Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The results suggest the existence of at least three distinct rhetorical archetypes in contemporary American political discourse:

1.  **The Institutional Unifier (McCain):** Characterized by high Bridging, Dignity, and Deliberation. The primary goal is to reinforce faith in democratic institutions and foster national unity, especially in moments of political transition. This rhetoric is de-escalating by nature. McCain's focus on a peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark: *"Today, I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love. And tonight, I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone."* (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

2.  **The Conservative Populist (King):** Characterized by high Tribalism, Bonding, and Fear. The goal is to mobilize a specific cultural in-group by emphasizing an existential threat posed by an out-group. The rhetoric is inherently polarizing and relies on a narrative of preservation and defense.

3.  **The Progressive Populist (Sanders/AOC):** Characterized by a unique fusion of high Empowerment, Hope, and Bonding, coupled with high Fear. The goal is to mobilize a class-based coalition by articulating an aspirational future while simultaneously defining a powerful adversary (e.g., "oligarchs," "the billionaire class") that must be overcome. This archetype channels anger and fear into a narrative of collective agency. As Sanders declared, *"The only way we win is when millions of people stand up and fight back. Our movement is about replacing a corrupt system with a government based on principles of justice."* (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

### 6.3 Limitations and Future Directions

The most significant limitation is the N=4 sample size. The findings, while intriguing, are preliminary and cannot be generalized. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the CFF's analytical potential and to generate hypotheses for further testing.

Future research should proceed along several lines:
*   **Scale:** Apply the CFF to a large-scale corpus of political texts to validate these archetypes and assess their prevalence over time.
*   **Temporality:** Analyze how the rhetoric of individual politicians or movements evolves, and whether they shift between these archetypal strategies.
*   **Predictive Power:** Investigate whether these C
