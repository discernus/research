    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech characterized by strong, unambiguous rhetoric. The dominant dimensions of Fear, Enmity, and Tribal Dominance are exceptionally clear and well-evidenced, making confidence in their scoring very high. Conversely, the cohesive dimensions (Amity, Compersion, Cohesive Goals) are almost entirely absent, which is also scored with high confidence. The analysis focuses on the explicit rhetorical strategies and emotionally charged narratives used throughout the speech."
