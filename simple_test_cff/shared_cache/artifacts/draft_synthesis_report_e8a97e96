## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of four key political speeches from the "Democratic Discourse Corpus" using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis reveals significant polarization in rhetorical strategies and provides preliminary evidence for distinct political communication archetypes. The study's primary contribution lies in demonstrating the CFF's capacity to move beyond simple sentiment analysis, capturing the complex and often contradictory nature of political language. Due to the pilot nature of this study (N=4), all findings should be considered preliminary and indicative, requiring validation with a larger corpus.

Key findings indicate strong internal construct validity for the CFF, with opposing dimensions exhibiting the expected strong negative correlations (e.g., Envy vs. Compersion, r = -0.98). The analysis of derived metrics, particularly the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, effectively differentiated the documents. John McCain's 2008 concession speech emerged as a model of "Cohesive Institutionalism," with a high Cohesion Index (+0.84) and minimal contradiction. In stark contrast, speeches by Steve King, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were characterized by negative cohesion scores (-0.74, -0.37, and -0.17, respectively), indicating a reliance on fragmentative rhetoric. Notably, the populist speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez displayed higher levels of strategic contradiction, blending divisive language with appeals to in-group solidarity.

The framework proved effective in identifying these nuanced strategies. For instance, the analysis uncovered a "Fragmentative Populist" meta-strategy, a statistically significant cluster of co-occurring dimensions including Tribal Dominance, Fear, Envy, and Enmity. This suggests that certain rhetorical tools are frequently deployed together to achieve specific political aims. The report concludes that the CFF is a promising tool for dissecting the linguistic mechanisms that influence social cohesion, offering a robust methodology for future, larger-scale studies of political discourse.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of the Democratic Discourse Corpus using the CFF v10.1 yielded several key insights into the structure of contemporary political rhetoric.

*   **Rhetoric is Highly Polarized:** The documents analyzed occupy opposite ends of the cohesion spectrum. The `Full Cohesion Index` ranged from a highly cohesive +0.84 (McCain) to a deeply fragmentative -0.74 (King), with a large standard deviation (0.67) across the small corpus, indicating a profound divergence in communication styles rather than a shared rhetorical center.
*   **Framework Oppositions are Statistically Validated:** The CFF's core design, which pairs opposing concepts (e.g., Hope vs. Fear), is strongly supported by the data. The analysis found consistent, strong negative correlations between these pairs, such as `envy_raw` and `compersion_raw` (r = -0.98) and `tribal_dominance_raw` and `individual_dignity_raw` (r = -0.78), confirming they measure genuinely opposing rhetorical constructs.
*   **Populist Rhetoric is Strategically Contradictory:** While institutional rhetoric (McCain) was found to be highly consistent (low `Strategic Contradiction Index` of 0.01), populist speeches were more complex. Bernie Sanders' speech registered the highest contradiction score (0.10), indicating a sophisticated blend of competing appealsâ€”simultaneously invoking enmity towards an out-group and amity within the in-group.
*   **Two Dominant Meta-Strategies Emerged:** The data reveals two clear rhetorical clusters. A "Fragmentative" meta-strategy strongly links appeals to `tribal_dominance_raw`, `fear_raw` (r = +1.00), and `enmity_raw` (r = +0.97). A "Cohesive" meta-strategy links `individual_dignity_raw`, `amity_raw` (r = +0.85), and `cohesive_goals_raw` (r = +0.87). This suggests speakers draw from consistent, pre-packaged toolkits of persuasive language.
*   **Cohesive Language Can Serve Divisive Ends:** The analysis shows that appeals to "cohesion" are not always universally inclusive. For example, a speaker can use language of solidarity to unify a specific in-group against a perceived out-group. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated, "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This use of `cohesive_goals` occurs within a speech that is, on the whole, measured as fragmentative (`Full Cohesion Index` = -0.17).

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed for the nuanced analysis of political and social discourse. The CFF's primary innovation is its departure from single-axis measurement (e.g., sentiment analysis ranging from negative to positive). Instead, it independently scores ten dimensions of rhetoric organized into five oppositional pairs:
*   **Identity:** Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity
*   **Emotion:** Fear vs. Hope
*   **Success:** Envy vs. Compersion (joy in others' success)
*   **Relation:** Enmity vs. Amity
*   **Goals:** Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals

For each dimension, the framework calculates a `raw` score (intensity) and a `salience` score (prominence). This dual-measurement approach allows the CFF to capture sophisticated rhetorical strategies where a speaker might simultaneously use, for example, strong appeals to hope and moderate appeals to fear. From these base scores, the analysis calculates several derived metrics, including a `Full Cohesion Index` (a holistic measure of a text's contribution to social cohesion), and a `Strategic Contradiction Index` (measuring the degree of internal tension between competing rhetorical appeals).

### 4.2 Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was conducted on the "Democratic Discourse Corpus," a pilot corpus comprising four documents:
1.  **john_mccain_2008_concession.txt:** John McCain (Republican, 2008), an example of institutional concession speech.
2.  **steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt:** Steve King (Republican, 2017), an example of conservative populist rhetoric.
3.  **bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt:** Bernie Sanders (Independent, 2025), an example of progressive populist rhetoric.
4.  **alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt:** Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Democratic, 2025), another example of progressive populist rhetoric.

The data for each document consists of raw and salience scores for the ten CFF dimensions, along with confidence scores for each measurement.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis is primarily descriptive and exploratory, focusing on interpreting the provided statistical results. Key methods included:
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and range for all base and derived metrics to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for all raw and salience scores to identify relationships between rhetorical dimensions and validate the framework's oppositional structure.
*   **Derived Metric Analysis:** Interpretation of the `Full Cohesion Index`, `Strategic Contradiction Index`, and five `Tension Indices` to uncover higher-order patterns in rhetorical strategy.

A significant constraint is the small sample size (N=4). This precludes any form of inferential statistical testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) or generalization of the findings to a wider population of political speech. All conclusions are therefore presented as preliminary, suggestive patterns observed within this specific corpus. Furthermore, the `analyze_rhetorical_profiles_by_speaker` function was skipped due to a missing `corpus_manifest.json` file, preventing a formal aggregation of scores by speaker where multiple documents per speaker exist.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An analysis of the descriptive statistics for the corpus reveals a dataset characterized by high variance and rhetorical polarization. The means and standard deviations for the ten base raw scores and key derived indices are presented in Table 1.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key CFF Dimensions and Indices (N=4)**

| Dimension/Index                   | Mean   | Std. Dev. | Min    | Max    |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Base Dimensions (Raw Scores)**  |        |           |        |        |
| Tribal Dominance                  | 0.56   | 0.39      | 0.00   | 0.85   |
| Individual Dignity                | 0.48   | 0.38      | 0.10   | 0.80   |
| Fear                              | 0.60   | 0.36      | 0.10   | 0.90   |
| Hope                              | 0.43   | 0.38      | 0.10   | 0.80   |
| Envy                              | 0.63   | 0.43      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| Compersion                        | 0.23   | 0.45      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| Enmity                            | 0.63   | 0.42      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| Amity                             | 0.58   | 0.40      | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| Fragmentative Goals               | 0.58   | 0.39      | 0.00   | 0.80   |
| Cohesive Goals                    | 0.60   | 0.36      | 0.10   | 0.90   |
| **Derived Indices**               |        |           |        |        |
| Strategic Contradiction Index     | 0.05   | 0.04      | 0.01   | 0.10   |
| Full Cohesion Index               | -0.11  | 0.67      | -0.74  | 0.84   |

The large standard deviations, often approaching or exceeding the mean values, immediately signal a lack of a rhetorical "center" in this corpus. For nearly every dimension, scores span almost the entire possible range from 0.0 to 0.9. This is most pronounced in the `Full Cohesion Index`, which has a mean close to zero (-0.11) but a massive standard deviation (0.67), reflecting the deep divide between McCain's highly cohesive speech and the others' fragmentative rhetoric. The high mean scores for fragmentative dimensions like `Fear` (0.60), `Envy` (0.63), and `Enmity` (0.63) suggest that, on average, the language in this corpus leans more towards division than unity, though this average is heavily skewed by the three populist speeches.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Cohesion and Contradiction

The derived CFF metrics provide a powerful lens for understanding rhetorical strategy. By plotting the `Full Cohesion Index` against the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, we can map the strategic positioning of each document (see Table 2).

**Table 2: Cohesion vs. Contradiction Scores for Each Document**

| Document                                           | Full Cohesion Index | Strategic Contradiction Index | Rhetorical Quadrant             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| john_mccain_2008_concession.txt                    | 0.840               | 0.014                         | Coherently Cohesive             |
| steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt                    | -0.735              | 0.044                         | Coherently Fragmentative        |
| bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt         | -0.370              | 0.102                         | Contradictory & Fragmentative   |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt | -0.175              | 0.036                         | Contradictory & Fragmentative   |

This mapping reveals four distinct rhetorical postures:

1.  **Coherently Cohesive (McCain):** This profile combines very high cohesion with very low contradiction. The message is unambiguously aimed at unity, amity, and shared goals, without significant internal tension.
2.  **Coherently Fragmentative (King):** This profile combines very low cohesion with relatively low contradiction. The message is consistently divisive, focusing on themes of fear, enmity, and tribal dominance. The low contradiction score suggests a clear, unambiguous "us vs. them" narrative. This is textually supported by language that frames political outcomes in existential terms, as when Steve King speaks of a core principle that, "instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), a clear articulation of a `fragmentative_goal`.
3.  **Contradictory & Fragmentative (Sanders & Ocasio-Cortez):** These profiles exhibit negative cohesion but with higher levels of strategic contradiction. Sanders' speech is the most contradictory in the corpus (0.102). This indicates a complex strategy that, while ultimately fragmentative in its overall effect (pitting "the people" against an "oligarchy"), simultaneously employs cohesive language to build solidarity within the in-group. This blending of `enmity` towards an out-group and `amity` within the in-group is a hallmark of populist movements. The textual data supports this, with AOC calling for "class solidarity" in a speech that also scores high on `enmity` and `envy`.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix provides critical insights into the CFF's construct validity and reveals underlying rhetorical meta-strategies. The most important finding is the consistent negative correlation between the framework's opposing dimensions, which validates its theoretical design.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlations for CFF Oppositional Pairs (Raw Scores)**

| Oppositional Pair                 | Correlation (r) | Interpretation          |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Envy vs. Compersion               | -0.975          | Very Strong Negative    |
| Tribal Dominance vs. Ind. Dignity | -0.778          | Strong Negative         |
| Fragmentative vs. Cohesive Goals  | -0.630          | Moderate Negative       |
| Fear vs. Hope                     | -0.571          | Moderate Negative       |
| Enmity vs. Amity                  | -0.508          | Moderate Negative       |

The extremely strong negative correlation between `Envy` and `Compersion` (r = -0.975) suggests they are measuring two ends of a single, coherent psychological construct related to perceptions of success. The other pairs also show the expected negative relationship, confirming that the framework is successfully capturing these conceptual oppositions in text.

Beyond validation, the matrix reveals two powerful meta-strategies, or clusters of co-occurring rhetorical dimensions:

*   **The Fragmentative Cluster:** A set of fragmentative dimensions are very highly inter-correlated. `Tribal Dominance` is almost perfectly correlated with `Fear` (r = +0.996) and shows strong positive correlations with `Enmity` (r = +0.965) and `Fragmentative Goals` (r = +0.987). This indicates that when a speaker uses language of in-group preference, they are extremely likely to also use language of fear, hostility towards out-groups, and zero-sum goals. This cluster forms the statistical backbone of the "Fragmentative Nationalist" and "Fragmentative Progressive" archetypes. The rhetoric of Steve King, who warns that cherished values could be "destroyed" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), exemplifies this cluster by linking a `fragmentative_goal` with high scores on `fear` and `enmity`.

*   **The Cohesive Cluster:** A corresponding cohesive cluster also emerges. `Individual Dignity` is strongly correlated with `Amity` (r = +0.849) and `Cohesive Goals` (r = +0.868). This suggests that appeals to the inherent worth of every individual are frequently paired with language of friendship, mutual respect, and shared, positive-sum objectives. This cluster defines the "Cohesive Institutionalist" archetype embodied by McCain's speech.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed in this corpus align with the CFF's theoretical premise: that political language can be deconstructed into fundamental appeals that either build or break social cohesion. The strongest correlations highlight the practical reality of this premise. The near-perfect positive correlation between `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fear_raw` (r = +0.996) is not just a statistic; it suggests a core political strategy where defining a tribal "us" is instrumentally achieved by stoking fear of a "them."

Similarly, the strong negative correlation between `tribal_dominance_raw` and `individual_dignity_raw` (r = -0.778) is theoretically significant. It suggests a fundamental trade-off in political messaging: a focus on the supremacy of the in-group appears to come at the expense of emphasizing the dignity of all individuals, and vice-versa. This is textually complex, however. Steve King's speech, which scores highest on `tribal_dominance`, also contains the statement, "That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). While this sounds like a pure `individual_dignity` appeal, its presence in a highly tribal speech with low overall `individual_dignity` scores (0.1 raw, 0.1 salience) suggests it may function as a low-salience justification for a broader, more exclusionary agenda, a prime example of the strategic contradiction the CFF is designed to detect.

The framework's fit with the corpus appears strong. The clear separation of the documents based on the `Full Cohesion Index` and the internal consistency of the rhetorical clusters suggest the CFF's dimensions are well-suited to capturing the primary axes of variation in this style of political discourse. The framework effectively models the distinction between institutional and populist rhetoric, and further distinguishes between different flavors of populism (nationalist vs. progressive) through the `Strategic Contradiction Index`.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CFF demonstrates significant discriminatory power even with a small corpus. It successfully differentiated not only between cohesive and fragmentative speeches but also between different types of fragmentative rhetoric. The ability of the `Strategic Contradiction Index` to quantify the rhetorical complexity of the Sanders speech, separating it from the more straightforwardly fragmentative King speech, is a key indicator of the framework's effectiveness.

The framework-corpus fit is excellent. The dimensions of the CFF map directly onto the core themes observed in the texts. For example, the `Enmity`/`Amity` and `Tribal Dominance`/`Individual Dignity` axes are central to the populist speeches' "us vs. them" framing. The textual evidence aligns well with the statistical scores. For instance, Steve King's call to "preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend" the Constitution (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt) is coded as a `cohesive_goal`, yet its salience is low (0.2) compared to the high salience of fragmentative goals (0.8) in the same speech, perfectly illustrating how the CFF's salience-weighting provides a more accurate picture than a simple keyword search would.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Theoretical Implications and Archetypal Patterns

The findings from this pilot study, while preliminary, carry significant theoretical implications. They provide empirical support for the CFF's central claim: that a multi-dimensional, oppositional framework is necessary to capture the complexity of political discourse. The high `Strategic Contradiction Index` in populist speeches suggests that such rhetoric is not merely "negative" but is a sophisticated strategy of simultaneous demolition and constructionâ€”deconstructing trust in existing institutions while constructing a new, alternative basis for solidarity.

Based on the clustering of scores, we can propose three preliminary rhetorical archetypes present in this corpus:

1.  **The Cohesive Institutionalist (McCain):** Characterized by high scores on `Hope`, `Amity`, `Compersion`, `Individual Dignity`, and `Cohesive Goals`. This style seeks to unify a broad audience by appealing to shared values and the dignity of all. Its rhetoric is consistent and low in contradiction.
2.  **The Fragmentative Nationalist (King):** Characterized by high scores on `Fear`, `Enmity`, `Tribal Dominance`, and `Fragmentative Goals`. This style seeks to mobilize a specific in-group by emphasizing external threats and zero-sum conflicts. Its rhetoric is also highly consistent, presenting a clear and unambiguous worldview. The language focuses on destruction and preservation, as seen in King's warning that a principle would be "destroyed" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).
3.  **The Fragmentative Progressive (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez):** This is a more complex hybrid archetype. It shares the high `Enmity` and `Fragmentative Goals` of the nationalist (directed at an economic "oligarchy" rather than a cultural or national out-group) but blends them with high-amity appeals to a "movement" or "class." This results in a lower overall cohesion score but a much higher strategic contradiction. The call for "class solidarity" by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt) is a perfect example of a cohesive appeal nested within a broader fragmentative strategy.

### 6.2 Broader Significance and Future Directions

This analysis demonstrates the potential of computational methods like the CFF to provide objective, replicable, and nuanced insights into political communication. By moving beyond subjective interpretation, such tools can help identify the specific linguistic strategies that may be eroding social trust and democratic health.

The primary limitation of this study is its N=4 corpus. The findings, while intriguing, cannot be generalized. Future research is essential to validate these preliminary findings. A larger-scale study should be conducted with a diverse corpus of political speeches spanning different time periods, political parties, and countries. This would allow for robust testing of the proposed archetypes and a more definitive analysis of temporal trends in rhetorical cohesion. Researchers may wish to explore the relationship between a speaker's CFF profile and real-world outcomes, such as polling numbers, election results, or measures of social polarization.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though limited in scope, successfully demonstrates the analytical power of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework. The CFF proved effective at validating its own theoretical structure, identifying coherent meta-strategies within political language, and distinguishing between nuanced rhetorical archetypes. The framework's ability to quantify not just the content of speech (via raw scores) but also its internal complexity (via the `Strategic Contradiction Index`) represents a significant methodological advance.

The findings paint a preliminary picture of a polarized rhetorical landscape, where political actors employ distinct and often opposing communication toolkits. The identification of Cohesive Institutional, Fragmentative Nationalist, and Fragmentative Progressive archetypes provides a valuable, data-driven taxonomy for understanding contemporary political discourse. While these results must be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size, they lay a strong foundation and a clear methodological path for future research into the linguistic drivers of social cohesion and fragmentation.
