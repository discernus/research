## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of a small corpus (N=4) of political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis aimed to extract insights into the rhetorical strategies employed within the documents, focusing on their potential impact on social cohesion. Due to the pilot nature of this study with a very small sample size, all findings should be considered indicative and exploratory, intended to generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research.

The analysis reveals distinct and polarized rhetorical patterns within the corpus. Key findings indicate the presence of two primary, opposing meta-strategies. A "fragmentative" strategy was identified, characterized by a strong statistical clustering of `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`, `Enmity`, and `Fragmentative Goals` (average inter-correlation r > 0.90). Conversely, a "cohesive" strategy showed a tight linkage between `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals`. The CFF's core theoretical assumption of oppositional dimensions was supported by strong negative correlations between corresponding pairs (e.g., `Envy` vs. `Compersion`, r = -0.98), suggesting strong construct validity for the framework.

The study also leveraged the CFF's novel derived metrics. The `Full Cohesion Index` effectively discriminated between documents, ranging from highly cohesive (+0.84) to highly fragmentative (-0.74). The `Strategic Contradiction Index` identified texts employing mixed messaging, where appeals to cohesion and fragmentation co-exist. For instance, one text scored high on fragmentative dimensions while simultaneously invoking cohesive principles, as seen in the statement, "That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), which appeared in a speech otherwise dominated by divisive rhetoric. These preliminary results demonstrate the CFF's potential to move beyond simple sentiment analysis and capture the sophisticated, often contradictory, nature of political discourse.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis produced several key insights into the rhetorical structure of the analyzed corpus. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation with a larger dataset.

*   **Two Opposing Rhetorical Archetypes Dominate:** The data reveals two strongly defined and statistically opposed rhetorical strategies. A fragmentative archetype combines `Fear`, `Enmity`, and `Tribal Dominance` (r > 0.96), while a cohesive archetype links `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals` (r > 0.86). This suggests that speakers in this corpus tend to adopt one of two comprehensive and internally consistent rhetorical postures.
*   **Framework Construct Validity Appears Strong:** The CFF's oppositional design is statistically supported. Dimensions intended to be opposites demonstrate strong negative correlations. The most striking example is the near-perfect inverse relationship between `Envy` and `Compersion` (r = -0.98), and `Tribal Dominance` and `Compersion` (r = -0.96). This suggests the framework accurately measures the distinct rhetorical constructs it defines.
*   **Cohesion and Contradiction are Independent Factors:** The analysis indicates that a message's overall cohesiveness (`Full Cohesion Index`) is distinct from its internal consistency (`Strategic Contradiction Index`). The most cohesive document (McCain, Cohesion = +0.84) was also the most consistent (Contradiction = 0.01), while another document (Sanders) combined moderate fragmentation (Cohesion = -0.37) with the highest level of strategic contradiction (0.10).
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric is Tightly Integrated:** The dimensions associated with social fragmentation (`Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`, `Enmity`, `Fragmentative Goals`) are more tightly inter-correlated than their cohesive counterparts. This may suggest that fragmentative rhetoric relies on a more standardized and mutually reinforcing set of emotional and ideological appeals. This is evident in discourse that frames political outcomes in existential terms, such as a policy being "destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), linking fragmentative goals directly to fear-based outcomes.
*   **Rhetorical Contradiction Signals Complex Strategy:** Documents with higher `Strategic Contradiction Index` scores appear to blend cohesive and fragmentative appeals. For example, a speech that was measured as highly fragmentative overall contained appeals to universal rights, stating the importance of ensuring "everybody [is] treated equally" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This demonstrates the CFF's ability to detect nuanced strategies where speakers may use inclusive language to soften a divisive message.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis utilizes the **Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1**, a computational tool designed to analyze political and social discourse. The CFF moves beyond simplistic positive/negative sentiment analysis by independently scoring texts across ten primary dimensions, organized into five oppositional pairs:
*   **Identity:** Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity
*   **Emotion:** Fear vs. Hope
*   **Success:** Envy vs. Compersion
*   **Relation:** Enmity vs. Amity
*   **Goals:** Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals

A key innovation of the CFF is its ability to capture rhetorical complexity by scoring each dimension independently. This allows for the analysis of texts that may simultaneously employ competing appeals (e.g., high scores in both Hope and Fear). From these base scores, the framework calculates several derived metrics, including **Tension Indices** for each pair, a **Strategic Contradiction Index** (the average of tensions), and three normalized **Cohesion Indices** (Descriptive, Motivational, and Full) that provide an overall measure of a text's rhetorical orientation toward social cohesion or fragmentation.

### Data and Corpus
The corpus for this pilot study consists of four political texts. The document names are: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`, `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`, `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`, and `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`. Each document was processed to generate raw intensity scores (0-1) and salience scores (0-1) for the ten primary CFF dimensions.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations
The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational. It involved calculating summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) for all raw, salience, and derived CFF metrics. A Pearson correlation matrix was computed to examine the relationships between all measured dimensions.

The primary limitation of this study is its **extremely small sample size (N=4)**. Consequently, the findings are exploratory and cannot be generalized. The statistical results, particularly correlations, should be interpreted with extreme caution as they are highly sensitive to the specific documents in the corpus. The purpose of this report is not to make definitive claims but to demonstrate the analytical potential of the CFF and to generate hypotheses for future research on a larger, more representative corpus.

Furthermore, an analysis of rhetorical profiles by speaker was attempted but **skipped** because the required `corpus_manifest.json` file, which maps documents to speakers, was not available. This prevents any systematic comparison between speakers in this report.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An analysis of the descriptive statistics across the four documents reveals a corpus with wide rhetorical diversity. The `Full Cohesion Index`, a key summary metric, ranges from a highly fragmentative -0.74 to a highly cohesive +0.84, with a mean of -0.11. The large standard deviation (0.67) for this index confirms that the selected documents represent a broad spectrum of political discourse, providing a solid basis for exploratory analysis.

Similarly, fragmentative dimensions like `Tribal Dominance` (M=0.56, SD=0.39) and `Envy` (M=0.63, SD=0.43) show high means and variance, as do cohesive dimensions like `Individual Dignity` (M=0.48, SD=0.38) and `Amity` (M=0.58, SD=0.40). This indicates that the corpus is not monolithically skewed toward one rhetorical style but contains strong examples of both. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` (M=0.05, SD=0.04) shows less variance but still indicates that some documents employ more internally contradictory rhetoric than others.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The CFF's derived metrics provide a higher-level view of rhetorical strategy. The relationship between the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index` is particularly insightful. Plotting these two metrics reveals four potential rhetorical quadrants. In this small corpus, we observe three:

1.  **Coherently Cohesive (Low Contradiction, High Cohesion):** The McCain concession speech exemplifies this, with the lowest contradiction score (0.014) and the highest cohesion score (+0.84).
2.  **Coherently Fragmentative (Low Contradiction, Low Cohesion):** The Steve King speech fits this profile, with a relatively low contradiction score (0.044) and the lowest cohesion score (-0.74).
3.  **Incoherently Fragmentative (High Contradiction, Low Cohesion):** The Bernie Sanders speech occupies this space, with the highest contradiction score (0.102) and a negative cohesion score (-0.37).

This demonstrates the analytical power of separating a message's directional aim (cohesion/fragmentation) from its internal consistency. The high contradiction score for the Sanders text suggests a complex message blending strong fragmentative themes (e.g., `Envy`, `Enmity`) with cohesive appeals, creating rhetorical tension.

| bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt       | 0.102                         | -0.370              |

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix offers deep insights into the structural relationships between rhetorical dimensions and serves as a key tool for assessing the CFF's construct validity. The results indicate two powerful, opposing clusters of rhetorical appeals.

**Fragmentative Cluster:** A very strong positive correlation exists among `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`, `Enmity`, and `Fragmentative Goals`. For example, the correlation between `Fear Raw` and `Tribal Dominance Raw` is r = +0.996, and between `Enmity Raw` and `Tribal Dominance Raw` is r = +0.965. This suggests that when a speaker in this corpus uses one of these fragmentative appeals, they are highly likely to use the others in concert, forming a coherent fragmentative meta-strategy. This is textually supported by rhetoric that links a specific group-based threat to a destructive outcome, such as a political action that would ensure a value system is "destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

**Cohesive Cluster:** A corresponding, though slightly less tight, cluster exists among the cohesive dimensions. The strongest relationship is a near-perfect correlation between `Amity Raw` and `Cohesive Goals Raw` (r = +0.999). `Individual Dignity Raw` also correlates strongly with `Cohesive Goals Raw` (r = +0.868). This suggests a cohesive meta-strategy that links pro-social relationships with shared, positive goals. This pattern is evident in discourse that explicitly defines a collective goal in terms of unity, such as a movement being "not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

**Oppositional Validation:** Crucially, the analysis validates the CFF's oppositional design. Dimensions designed as opposites show strong negative correlations. For instance, `Tribal Dominance Raw` is strongly negatively correlated with `Individual Dignity Raw` (r = -0.778). The most powerful oppositional relationships are `Envy Raw` vs. `Compersion Raw` (r = -0.975) and `Tribal Dominance Salience` vs. `Compersion Salience` (r = -1.000). This perfect negative correlation indicates that, in this corpus, the salience of `Tribal Dominance` and `Compersion` are mutually exclusive, providing strong evidence for the framework's discriminatory power.

| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Fragmentative Cluster**   |                             |                 |                                              |
| Fear Raw                    | Tribal Dominance Raw        | 0.996           | Very Strong Positive                         |
| Enmity Raw                  | Tribal Dominance Raw        | 0.965           | Very Strong Positive                         |
| Fragmentative Goals Raw     | Fear Raw                    | 0.970           | Very Strong Positive                         |
| **Cohesive Cluster**        |                             |                 |                                              |
| Amity Raw                   | Cohesive Goals Raw          | 0.999           | Near-Perfect Positive                        |
| Individual Dignity Raw      | Cohesive Goals Raw          | 0.868           | Strong Positive                              |
| **Oppositional Validation** |                             |                 |                                              |
| Envy Raw                    | Compersion Raw              | -0.975          | Very Strong Negative                         |
| Tribal Dominance Raw        | Individual Dignity Raw      | -0.778          | Strong Negative                              |
| Fear Raw                    | Hope Raw                    | -0.571          | Moderate Negative                            |

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns reveal a polarized rhetorical landscape where speakers tend to adopt one of two holistic strategies. The fragmentative strategy appears particularly cohesive and potent, linking identity-based threats (`Tribal Dominance`) to negative emotions (`Fear`, `Envy`) and adversarial postures (`Enmity`). This creates a powerful narrative of in-group peril and out-group threat. The textual evidence supports this, as seen in the Steve King document, which scores high on these dimensions and contains language about existential threats to the constitutional order.

The framework's ability to detect contradiction is a significant finding. The Steve King speech, while overwhelmingly fragmentative, also contains clear expressions of `Individual Dignity`, such as the assertion that "being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). The CFF's independent scoring captures this nuance, which would be lost in a simple net-sentiment model. This suggests a sophisticated strategy of "strategic mitigation," where a speaker may use appeals to universal values to provide cover for or soften a primarily divisive message. This simultaneous use of opposing appeals is precisely what the `Strategic Contradiction Index` is designed to quantify.

Similarly, the strong link between `Amity` and `Cohesive Goals` (r = +0.999) suggests that appeals to pro-social goals are almost always framed in terms of positive relationships. The quote from the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez document, which defines the movement's goal as "class solidarity" and explicitly rejects "partisan labels," perfectly illustrates this statistical bond (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This finding suggests that effective cohesive rhetoric may depend on grounding abstract goals in tangible, relational terms.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) demonstrates considerable promise as an analytical tool.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework effectively distinguishes between different rhetorical styles. The wide variance in both the base dimensions and the summary `Full Cohesion Index` shows that the CFF is sensitive to the differences in the corpus documents, avoiding floor or ceiling effects.
*   **Construct Validity:** The strong negative correlations between oppositional dimensions (e.g., `Envy`/`Compersion`, `Tribal Dominance`/`Individual Dignity`) provide initial, positive evidence for the framework's construct validity. The dimensions behave statistically as they are theorized to behave, which is a crucial test for any measurement instrument.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF appears to be a good fit for analyzing this corpus of political texts. The emergence of clear "cohesive" and "fragmentative" meta-strategies aligns well with common understandings of political polarization. The framework's more novel metrics, like the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, add a layer of sophistication by revealing complex strategies that would otherwise be missed. The textual evidence, though limited, aligns well with the statistical findings, suggesting the framework is capturing meaningful rhetorical phenomena. For instance, the framework's detection of both `Cohesive Goals` and fragmentative themes in the same speech is supported by the presence of quotes like "We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt) within a document that also speaks of political destruction.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this pilot study, while preliminary, carry several important implications. The identification of two distinct and opposing rhetorical archetypes—one cohesive, one fragmentative—provides a data-driven confirmation of the polarized nature of the discourse within this small sample. The fragmentative archetype, with its tight integration of fear, enmity, and tribalism, appears to be a particularly consistent and well-defined strategy. This may suggest that such rhetoric follows a common, repeatable playbook of out-group threat construction.

The most significant theoretical contribution of this analysis is the insight derived from the `Strategic Contradiction Index`. The finding that a document can be both highly fragmentative and contain clear appeals to cohesive values (like universal dignity) challenges simpler models of political speech. It suggests that some political actors may not simply be "divisive" but may employ a more complex strategy of "divisiveness with plausible deniability," using mitigating language to appeal to different audiences or to defend against accusations of extremism. This warrants significant further research, as it complicates our understanding of how polarizing rhetoric functions.

The limitations of this study are significant. The N=4 sample size means these patterns could be idiosyncratic to these specific texts. The inability to perform a speaker-level analysis also prevents comparison across individuals. Future research should apply the CFF to a large, diachronic corpus of political speech. This would allow for testing whether the observed rhetorical clusters are stable over time and across different political contexts. It would also enable the tracking of individual speakers' rhetorical trajectories and the identification of broader shifts in the rhetorical landscape (e.g., is political discourse becoming more or less contradictory over time?).

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of four political texts through the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) has yielded several indicative insights. Despite the major limitation of a small sample size, the results demonstrate the framework's potential utility. The analysis successfully identified two opposing rhetorical meta-strategies, provided initial evidence for the CFF's construct validity through strong correlations, and highlighted the value of novel metrics like the `Strategic Contradiction Index` for uncovering sophisticated rhetorical patterns.

The study suggests that the CFF is a promising tool for moving discourse analysis beyond simple sentiment scoring toward a more nuanced understanding of how language builds or erodes social cohesion. The key takeaway is the framework's ability to quantify not just the direction of rhetoric (cohesive vs. fragmentative) but also its internal complexity and consistency. The patterns uncovered here serve as a compelling set of hypotheses for a larger, more definitive study on the dynamics of political discourse.
