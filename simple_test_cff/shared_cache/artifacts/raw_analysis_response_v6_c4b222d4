    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic political concession speech. Its rhetorical structure is exceptionally clear, focusing on themes of unity, democratic process, and graciousness in defeat. The scores reflect this clarity, with strong expressions of the 'cohesive' dimensions and a near-total absence of the 'fragmentative' ones. The analysis focused on the speaker's explicit calls to action and characterizations of the opponent and the nation."
