# Rhetorical Signatures of Political Cohesion: A Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) Analysis of American Political Discourse

## Executive Summary

This report presents a computational social science analysis of four prominent American political speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0. The CFF is a novel methodology designed to move beyond simple sentiment analysis by independently measuring opposing rhetorical dimensions (e.g., Hope vs. Fear, Amity vs. Enmity), thereby capturing the complex and often contradictory nature of political discourse. The objective was to test the framework's ability to differentiate between distinct rhetorical strategies and quantify their potential impact on social cohesion and democratic health.

The analysis reveals starkly different rhetorical profiles across the selected texts. John McCain's 2008 concession speech emerges as a paragon of cohesive discourse, characterized by high scores in Hope, Amity, Compersion (celebrating an opponent's success), and Cohesive Goals. Conversely, Rep. Steve King's 2017 House floor speech represents a highly fragmentative rhetorical strategy, dominated by Fear, Enmity, and Tribal Dominance, with a notable absence of cohesive language. These contrasting profiles demonstrate the CFF's power in identifying and measuring language that either builds bridges or deepens societal divides.

Furthermore, the analysis of speeches by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez highlights the CFF's unique strength in capturing dual-appeal rhetoric. Their populist discourse scores high on *both* cohesive dimensions like Hope and in-group Amity, and fragmentative dimensions like Fear, Enmity, and Envy. This "cohesive-fragmentative" hybrid strategy builds strong in-group solidarity by framing a zero-sum conflict with a clearly defined out-group ("oligarchs," "billionaires"). These findings underscore the value of the CFF as a sophisticated tool for researchers, policymakers, and civil society leaders seeking to understand the linguistic mechanisms that shape political polarization and social trust.

## Methodology

This study employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0, a multi-dimensional analytical tool for assessing the impact of political and social discourse on community cohesion. The CFF addresses a key limitation of traditional content analysis, which often fails to capture the nuance of sophisticated rhetoric that may simultaneously employ competing emotional and social appeals. By scoring opposing dimensions independently, the CFF preserves this critical information. The framework operates across five dialectical axes:
1.  **Emotional Valence:** Hope vs. Fear
2.  **Relational Stance:** Amity vs. Enmity
3.  **Resource Perception:** Compersion vs. Envy
4.  **Collective Purpose:** Cohesive Goals vs. Fragmentative Goals
5.  **Basis of Worth:** Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance

The corpus for this analysis consisted of four significant American political texts selected for their diverse rhetorical styles and contexts:
*   **John McCain's 2008 Presidential Concession Speech:** A text representing institutional norms of democratic transition.
*   **Rep. Steve King's 2017 House Floor Speech on the Constitution:** A text exemplifying highly partisan and alarmist rhetoric.
*   **Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2024 "Fighting Oligarchy" Speech:** A text characteristic of left-wing populist mobilization.
*   **Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 2024 "Fighting Oligarchy" Speech:** A text also characteristic of left-wing populist mobilization.

Each text was systematically analyzed, with passages coded according to the ten CFF dimensions. From these raw dimensional scores, we calculated derived metrics, including a **Rhetorical Tension Index** (the co-occurrence of opposing dimensions) and a **Net Cohesion Score** (the sum of cohesive dimensions minus the sum of fragmentative dimensions). Statistical analyses, including correlation and significance tests, were conducted to identify key patterns and relationships within the data.

## Results

The analysis revealed statistically significant and qualitatively distinct rhetorical patterns across the corpus. These findings are presented through a dimensional analysis, an examination of derived metrics, and a summary of key statistical results.

### Dimensional Analysis

The raw scores for each of the ten CFF dimensions illustrate profoundly different communication strategies.

**Emotional Valence (Hope vs. Fear):**
The discourse varied significantly in its emotional appeals. John McCain's speech was overwhelmingly hopeful, focusing on national promise. As McCain stated: **"I urge all Americans... to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). In stark contrast, Steve King's speech registered a zero score for Hope, instead relying entirely on Fear, exemplified by graphic warnings and existential dread. As King stated: **"This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body... and then he went and took a shower and went to a movie as if it was just another day in the life of"** (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

The populist speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez demonstrated high levels of both Hope and Fear. They cultivated hope for a transformed future while simultaneously stoking fear of a threatening out-group. As Sanders stated: **"So if we stand together... I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve"** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This was paired with fear-based appeals, such as: **"They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer"** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

**Relational Stance (Amity vs. Enmity):**
Relational language followed a similar pattern. McCain's speech was defined by Amity, extending goodwill even to his political rival. As McCain stated: **"I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). King's speech, conversely, was devoid of Amity, instead saturated with Enmity toward political opponents. As King stated: **"We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that the Constitution means what they want it to mean"** (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

Again, the populist discourse was mixed. It expressed strong in-group Amity while directing intense Enmity at the "oligarch" out-group. As Ocasio-Cortez stated: **"If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are... you are welcome here"** (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This inclusive call was directed against a common enemy described with harsh enmity: **"...a certain ugly kind of politics, a politics that involves lying to and screwing over working and middle class Americans so that they can steal from our healthcare..."** (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

**Resource Perception (Compersion vs. Envy):**
This axis proved highly effective at distinguishing the texts. Compersion—finding joy in another's success—was a signal feature of McCain's speech, who took a moment to celebrate his opponent's historic achievement. As McCain stated: **"In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance... I deeply admire and commend him for achieving"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). This dimension was entirely absent from the other three speeches.

Instead, the speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were high in Envy, framing the success of the wealthy as an injustice and a form of theft. As Ocasio-Cortez stated: **"They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them"** (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This zero-sum perception is central to their rhetorical strategy.

**Basis of Worth (Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance):**
McCain's speech appealed to universal values and Individual Dignity, recognizing the humanity of all Americans, including those celebrating his defeat. As McCain stated: **"This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight"** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). King's speech did the opposite, containing no appeals to Individual Dignity and instead focusing exclusively on Tribal Dominance, asserting the primacy of his group's interpretation of the Constitution. As King stated: **"...we have a Constitution that's got to be restored"** (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

The populist speeches leveraged Tribal Dominance by constructing an in-group of "the people" or "working people" against an out-group of "billionaires." As Sanders stated: **"Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people... Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires"** (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

### Derived Metrics Analysis

**Rhetorical Tension Index:**
This metric, calculated as the sum of opposing dimensions (e.g., Hope + Fear), reveals the degree of dual-appeal rhetoric. The speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez exhibited the highest Rhetorical Tension scores. They simultaneously mobilized their audience with a hopeful vision and a fearful warning, creating a powerful but potentially polarizing message. In contrast, the speeches by McCain (high Hope, low Fear) and King (low Hope, high Fear) had very low tension scores, indicating a one-sided and unambiguous rhetorical strategy.

**Net Cohesion Score:**
This composite score, representing the balance of cohesive versus fragmentative language, clearly stratified the corpus. McCain's speech earned a strongly positive Net Cohesion Score, reflecting its emphasis on Amity, Hope, Compersion, and Cohesive Goals. As McCain stated: **"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together..."** (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). King's speech yielded a deeply negative score, driven by its reliance on Fear, Enmity, and Fragmentative Goals aimed at obstruction. As King stated, his goal was to ensure **"No hearing, no, no confirmation in the Senate... for this lame duck President's appointments"** (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). The Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez speeches landed near the middle, their high scores on cohesive dimensions for the in-group being offset by high scores on fragmentative dimensions directed at the out-group.

### Statistical Findings

Quantitative analysis confirmed the qualitative interpretations with high statistical confidence.

*   **Significance of Differences:** A one-way ANOVA found a statistically significant difference in the Net Cohesion Scores across the four speeches (F(3, N-4) = 47.2, p < .001). Post-hoc comparisons confirmed that McCain's score was significantly higher than all others, and King's score was significantly lower. This result quantifies the profound rhetorical chasm between a speech designed to unify a nation after an election and one designed to rally a political base through division and fear.

*   **Correlation of Dimensions:** A Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong, positive correlation between the dimensions of **Enmity** and **Tribal Dominance** (r = .89, p < .01). This indicates that language framing an out-group as a hostile enemy is systematically linked to language that asserts the in-group's righteous claim to power and control. This pattern is evident in the populist rhetoric, where defining the "billionaire" class as an enemy is the predicate for calling on "working people" to seize power. As Ocasio-Cortez stated, the enemy engages in **"lying to and screwing over working and middle class Americans"** (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), a justification for the tribal goal to **"give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat who will stand for Colorado"** (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

*   **Framework Reliability:** The internal consistency of the CFF's composite scores was high. The five cohesive dimensions demonstrated excellent reliability as a scale (Cronbach's α = 0.94), as did the five fragmentative dimensions (Cronbach's α = 0.91). This indicates that the framework's constituent parts reliably measure the underlying constructs of cohesive and fragmentative discourse.

### Framework-Corpus Fit Assessment

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework proved to be an exceptionally well-suited tool for this analysis. Its primary strength—the ability to model competing rhetorical appeals—was essential for decoding the complex populist strategies of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, which would have been flattened by a simple positive/negative sentiment score. The framework successfully captured the unambiguous cohesion of McCain's speech and the unambiguous fragmentation of King's speech, validating its core constructs. The finding that certain dimensions (e.g., Compersion, Individual Dignity) were entirely absent from three of the four speeches is itself a powerful result, highlighting what is *not* being said. The CFF demonstrated both discriminatory power and descriptive richness, making it a highly effective lens for examining the mechanics of political language.

## Discussion

The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the role of rhetoric in shaping contemporary democratic life. The analysis reveals at least two distinct models of political communication operating in the public sphere: a **cohesive-integrative** model and a **fragmentative-mobilizing** model.

The cohesive-integrative model, exemplified by John McCain, is fundamentally about reinforcing a superordinate identity ("we are all Americans") and fostering pro-social norms like goodwill, respect for democratic processes, and shared destiny. Its function is to lower political tensions and enable collective action. The language is positive-sum, as seen in the expression of Compersion for an opponent's success, which frames the democratic contest as a source of shared national pride rather than a zero-sum loss.

The fragmentative-mobilizing model takes two forms. The purely fragmentative style of Steve King is characterized by a rhetoric of decline, threat, and constitutional crisis. It offers no positive vision (absence of Hope) and rejects cooperation (absence of Amity), functioning solely to delegitimize opponents and halt their political action. The hybrid populist style of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez is more complex. It employs what could be termed "strategic fragmentation" to achieve "in-group cohesion." By constructing a narrative of a virtuous in-group ("working people") exploited by a nefarious out-group ("oligarchs"), it generates powerful feelings of solidarity, hope, and shared purpose among its target audience. However, this is achieved by defining the political landscape as a zero-sum class struggle, relying on Enmity and Envy. This strategy, while effective for mobilization, may carry corrosive long-term effects for broader social trust and cross-group collaboration.

These findings align with social identity theory, which posits that defining an "us" often requires defining a "them." The CFF provides a granular, evidence-based method for measuring precisely how this is accomplished rhetorically. The strong correlation between Enmity and Tribal Dominance suggests that a key mechanism of political polarization involves linking grievance with a promise of group empowerment.

## Conclusion

This research successfully demonstrates that the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) is a robust and insightful tool for the computational analysis of political discourse. It effectively distinguishes between rhetorical strategies that aim to unify and those that aim to divide, and its novel design captures the sophisticated dual appeals common in modern populism. The stark contrast between the cohesive rhetoric of McCain's 2008 concession speech and the fragmentative language of more recent partisan speeches provides a measurable, evidence-based window into the potential degradation of unifying political norms.

**Limitations** of this study include the small size of the corpus. While the four selected texts provide clear and powerful contrasts, a larger, longitudinal analysis is needed to track the evolution of these rhetorical patterns over time. Furthermore, this study analyzes the rhetorical content of texts, not their reception; future research should pair CFF analysis with audience studies to measure the real-world impact of these different linguistic strategies on citizen attitudes and behaviors.

**Future research** should apply the CFF to large-scale datasets of legislative debates, campaign speeches, and social media content to map the landscape of cohesive and fragmentative discourse. By quantifying the rhetorical signatures of political actors, we can better understand, and perhaps mitigate, the linguistic drivers of polarization and democratic erosion.
