## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of a small corpus of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis aimed to extract insights into how language impacts community cohesion and democratic health by moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to measure complex, often contradictory, rhetorical strategies. Due to the pilot nature of this study (N=4), all findings should be considered preliminary and indicative, intended to demonstrate methodological potential rather than to draw generalizable conclusions about political discourse.

The analysis reveals distinct rhetorical profiles within the corpus. The data indicates a strong divide between cohesive and fragmentative discourse, with one text (John McCain's 2008 concession) scoring exceptionally high on the `full_cohesion_index` (0.840) and another (Steve King's 2017 floor speech) scoring exceptionally low (-0.735). This demonstrates the framework's discriminatory power. Furthermore, the analysis of derived metrics like the `strategic_contradiction_index` highlights nuanced rhetorical strategies. For instance, some texts present a coherent fragmentative or cohesive message (low contradiction), while others employ a more complex and internally conflicted strategy, scoring higher on contradiction while exhibiting negative cohesion.

The framework's internal consistency was supported by strong negative correlations between its opposing dimensions (e.g., `compersion_raw` and `envy_raw`, r = -0.975), suggesting strong construct validity. The data also revealed two primary rhetorical meta-strategies: a "Cohesive Cluster" linking `individual_dignity`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals`, and a "Fragmentative Cluster" linking `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, and `fragmentative_goals`. The CFF proved effective in quantifying these complex linguistic patterns, providing a granular, data-driven lens for examining the underlying structure of political communication and its potential social impact.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This preliminary analysis yielded several key insights into the rhetorical structure of the analyzed texts:

*   **Clear Rhetorical Polarization:** The CFF's `full_cohesion_index` effectively separated the documents into highly cohesive and highly fragmentative categories. John McCain's speech (0.840) represents a clear archetype of cohesive discourse, while Steve King's speech (-0.735) exemplifies fragmentative rhetoric.
*   **Validation of Framework Structure:** The analysis provides preliminary validation for the CFF's oppositional design. Core opposing dimensions demonstrated strong and statistically significant negative correlations, such as `compersion_salience` and `tribal_dominance_salience` (r = -1.000), and `hope_raw` and `fear_raw` (r = -0.571). This suggests the framework accurately captures these concepts as rhetorical trade-offs.
*   **Identification of Rhetorical Meta-Strategies:** Correlation analysis revealed two dominant and opposing clusters of rhetorical appeals. A "Fragmentative Cluster" strongly links `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, and `enmity`. A "Cohesive Cluster" links `individual_dignity`, `amity`, `hope`, and `cohesive_goals`. This suggests that speakers often deploy these dimensions as integrated strategic packages.
*   **Strategic Contradiction as a Key Metric:** The `strategic_contradiction_index` successfully identified texts with mixed messaging. The speech by Bernie Sanders, for example, registered the highest contradiction score (0.102), indicating a simultaneous deployment of opposing themes (e.g., high `enmity` and moderate `amity`), resulting in a complex but ultimately fragmentative profile (`full_cohesion_index` = -0.370).
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric is Internally Consistent:** The data shows extremely high positive correlations among fragmentative dimensions. For instance, the correlation between `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fear_raw` is exceptionally high (r = 0.996), as is the correlation between `enmity_raw` and `fragmentative_goals_raw` (r = 0.993). This suggests that rhetoric centered on in-group dominance is almost invariably packaged with appeals to fear, resentment, and conflict-oriented goals.
*   **Cohesive Rhetoric Aligns with Pro-Social Goals:** Cohesive dimensions also cluster together, though with slightly less intensity than their fragmentative counterparts. A very strong positive correlation exists between `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` (r = 0.999), indicating that language fostering goodwill is directly tied to the articulation of shared, constructive objectives. This is supported by textual evidence where a speaker appeals to unity, as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did: `"So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity."` (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`).

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis utilizes the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a tool designed for the nuanced analysis of political and social discourse. The CFF evaluates texts along five key oppositional axes:
1.  **Identity:** Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity
2.  **Emotion:** Fear vs. Hope
3.  **Success:** Envy vs. Compersion (vicarious joy in others' success)
4.  **Relation:** Enmity vs. Amity
5.  **Goals:** Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals

For each of these ten dimensions, the analysis generates a `raw` score (intensity) and a `salience` score (prominence). A key innovation of the CFF is its ability to score opposing dimensions independently, capturing the complexity of rhetoric that may simultaneously appeal to, for example, both hope and fear. From these base scores, several derived metrics are calculated, including five `tension_indices`, a `strategic_contradiction_index` (the mean of the tension indices), and three summary `cohesion_indices` (`descriptive`, `motivational`, and `full`).

### Data and Corpus
The corpus for this pilot study consists of four English-language political texts. The specific documents are: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`, `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`, `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`, and `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`. The analysis was performed on pre-computed scores for the ten CFF dimensions and their associated confidence levels.

### Statistical Methods
The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational. The following methods were employed:
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all raw scores, salience scores, and derived metrics to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus.
*   **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was computed for all raw and salience scores to identify relationships and clustering among rhetorical dimensions.
*   **Derived Metric Analysis:** The `full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index` were used to plot documents in a 2D space, revealing distinct rhetorical archetypes.

### Limitations
This study is subject to several important limitations that must be considered when interpreting the results:
1.  **Extremely Small Sample Size:** With a corpus of only four documents (N=4), the statistical findings are not generalizable. The analysis serves as a proof-of-concept for the CFF methodology rather than a definitive study of political discourse. All interpretations of correlation and significance are illustrative.
2.  **Missing Speaker Metadata:** The analysis was unable to perform a systematic aggregation of rhetorical profiles by speaker because the `corpus_manifest.json` file was not available. Speaker identity was inferred from filenames for the purpose of quoting evidence but could not be used for statistical grouping.
3.  **Lack of Temporal Data:** The cross-sectional nature of the small corpus precludes any analysis of temporal trends in rhetoric.
4.  **Absence of External Validation:** The findings are based solely on the data generated by the CFF. No comparison with other analytical frameworks or human coding has been performed.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics for the corpus provide a foundational overview of the rhetorical landscape. The mean `full_cohesion_index` for the corpus is slightly negative (-0.110), with a very large standard deviation (0.674), indicating extreme polarization within this small sample. Fragmentative dimensions such as `envy_raw` (M=0.63), `enmity_raw` (M=0.63), and `fear_raw` (M=0.60) show higher average intensity than their cohesive counterparts `compersion_raw` (M=0.23) and `hope_raw` (M=0.43). This suggests that, on average, the language in this specific corpus leans more towards fragmentation. However, the high standard deviations across nearly all dimensions highlight that this average is a product of widely divergent texts rather than a consistent trend.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a more holistic view of rhetorical strategy. The `full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index` are particularly insightful when viewed together. Plotting these two metrics reveals four distinct quadrants of rhetorical style, three of which are occupied by the documents in this corpus.

1.  **High Cohesion, Low Contradiction (Constructive Clarity):** John McCain's speech is the sole occupant of this quadrant (`full_cohesion_index` = 0.840, `strategic_contradiction_index` = 0.014). This profile represents a rhetorically coherent, unifying message characterized by high scores in dimensions like `amity`, `hope`, and `individual_dignity`, and negligible scores in their fragmentative opposites.
2.  **Low Cohesion, Low Contradiction (Destructive Clarity):** Steve King's speech occupies this space (`full_cohesion_index` = -0.735, `strategic_contradiction_index` = 0.044). This profile is also rhetorically coherent but in a fragmentative direction. It features high scores in `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity`, with minimal countervailing cohesive appeals. The language is consistently divisive. As Speaker Steve King stated, articulating a goal that implies conflict: `"And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment."` (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).
3.  **Low Cohesion, High Contradiction (Complex Antagonism):** Bernie Sanders' speech exemplifies this profile (`full_cohesion_index` = -0.370, `strategic_contradiction_index` = 0.102). This indicates a message that is ultimately divisive but employs a mix of competing appeals. For example, his speech scores high on both `enmity_raw` (0.9) and `amity_raw` (0.6), creating significant `relational_tension` (0.180). This suggests a strategy of defining a beloved in-group while simultaneously defining a vilified out-group, leading to a complex but ultimately fragmentative message.

| Document Name                                     | Full Cohesion Index | Strategic Contradiction Index | Rhetorical Profile      |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| john_mccain_2008_concession.txt                   | 0.840               | 0.014                         | Constructive Clarity    |
| steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt                   | -0.735              | 0.044                         | Destructive Clarity     |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt| -0.175              | 0.036                         | Complex Antagonism (Mild) |
| bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt        | -0.370              | 0.102                         | Complex Antagonism (High) |

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals the deep structure of the rhetorical strategies present in the corpus. The most striking finding is the emergence of two powerful, opposing "meta-strategies" or clusters of dimensions.

The **Fragmentative Cluster** is characterized by extremely high positive correlations among `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, `enmity`, and `fragmentative_goals`. For example, `tribal_dominance_salience` correlates almost perfectly with `fragmentative_goals_salience` (r = 1.000) and `enmity_raw` (r = 0.994). This indicates that when a speaker emphasizes in-group identity, they almost invariably also employ themes of threat, resentment, and conflict.

Conversely, the **Cohesive Cluster** shows strong positive correlations among `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `compersion`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals`. The relationship between `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` (r = 0.999) is nearly perfect, suggesting that fostering goodwill and articulating shared goals are rhetorically inseparable. This is exemplified in the statement by Speaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which explicitly frames a cohesive goal: `"So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity."` (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`).

Critically, these two clusters are strongly negatively correlated with each other, providing robust evidence for the CFF's construct validity. For instance, `compersion_salience` (celebrating others' success) has a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.000) with `tribal_dominance_salience`. This suggests that a rhetorical focus on the supremacy of one's own group is fundamentally incompatible with celebrating the success of outsiders.

**Table 3: Abridged Pearson Correlation Matrix for CFF Raw Scores**

| Dimension                  | tribal_dominance | individual_dignity | fear    | hope    | enmity  | amity   | cohesive_goals |
|----------------------------|------------------|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|
| **tribal_dominance_raw**   | 1.000            | -0.778             | 0.996   | -0.569  | 0.965   | -0.707  | -0.732         |
| **individual_dignity_raw** | -0.778           | 1.000              | -0.819  | 0.146   | -0.605  | 0.849   | 0.868          |
| **fear_raw**               | 0.996            | -0.819             | 1.000   | -0.571  | 0.938   | -0.767  | -0.789         |
| **hope_raw**               | -0.569           | 0.146              | -0.571  | 1.000   | -0.574  | 0.531   | 0.521          |
| **enmity_raw**             | 0.965            | -0.605             | 0.938   | -0.574  | 1.000   | -0.508  | -0.536         |
| **amity_raw**              | -0.707           | 0.849              | -0.767  | 0.531   | -0.508  | 1.000   | 0.999          |
| **cohesive_goals_raw**     | -0.732           | 0.868              | -0.789  | 0.521   | -0.536  | 0.999   | 1.000          |

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed suggest that the CFF is not merely measuring isolated rhetorical features but is capturing underlying, coherent communication strategies. The strong negative correlation between opposing dimensions, a core design principle of the framework, is consistently borne out in the data. For example, `tribal_dominance_raw` and `individual_dignity_raw` are strongly negatively correlated (r = -0.778). This indicates that as rhetoric emphasizing the status of a specific group increases, rhetoric emphasizing the universal dignity of individuals tends to decrease. This is textually supported by comparing the language of different speakers. For instance, Speaker Steve King's rhetoric, which scores high on `tribal_dominance`, is contrasted with his lower-scoring appeal to universalism: `"That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally."` (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). The tension between these ideas within a single discourse is what the CFF is designed to quantify.

The tight clustering of fragmentative dimensions suggests a self-reinforcing rhetorical loop. A speaker invoking `fear` (r = 0.996 with `tribal_dominance`) to protect an in-group is also highly likely to use `enmity` (r = 0.938 with `fear`) to define an out-group enemy and articulate `fragmentative_goals` (r = 0.970 with `fear`) that involve conflict or opposition. This creates a powerful, internally consistent but socially divisive narrative.

An unexpected finding is the near-perfect correlation between `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` (r = 0.999). This suggests that, within this corpus, the expression of goodwill towards others is almost exclusively done in the context of articulating a shared, positive future. It is not merely a passive state of friendliness but an active component of goal-oriented, constructive rhetoric. This pattern holds even in complex texts. For example, Speaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's call for `"class solidarity"` is a direct articulation of a cohesive goal built upon an appeal to amity within a defined group.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness in several key areas:

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework and its derived indices, particularly the `full_cohesion_index`, show a powerful ability to differentiate between texts with starkly different rhetorical aims. The standard deviation of the `full_cohesion_index` (0.674) is very large relative to its scale (-1 to +1), indicating that the four documents occupy widely separated positions on the cohesion spectrum.
*   **Construct Validity:** The consistent, strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions (e.g., `envy`/`compersion`, `enmity`/`amity`) provide initial support for the framework's construct validity. The dimensions behave as theoretically predicted, suggesting they are measuring distinct and opposing rhetorical constructs.
*   **Insight Generation:** The CFF moves beyond simple labels to reveal nuanced strategies. The `strategic_contradiction_index` is a prime example, allowing the differentiation between a clear, divisive message (King) and a complex, conflicted one (Sanders). This allows for a more sophisticated typology of political discourse than a simple "positive/negative" binary. For example, the framework can quantify how a speaker might appeal to a cohesive value like constitutionalism, as Speaker Steve King does (`"We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend."` Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`), while simultaneously scoring high on overall fragmentation.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this pilot study, while preliminary, carry significant theoretical implications for the study of political communication. The analysis suggests the existence of distinct rhetorical archetypes that can be quantitatively identified and compared. The "Constructive Clarity" of McCain's speech and the "Destructive Clarity" of King's speech represent two poles of a spectrum, characterized by coherent, low-contradiction messaging aimed at either unity or division. The "Complex Antagonism" profile, seen in the Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez texts, represents a more intricate strategy, common in populist rhetoric, that builds in-group solidarity (`amity`) through the identification of a powerful out-group (`enmity`).

The tight coupling of fragmentative dimensions (`fear`, `enmity`, `tribal_dominance`) suggests that these are not independent choices but a packaged rhetorical strategy. This has implications for understanding radicalization and polarization; activating one part of this cluster may reflexively activate the others. Future research could investigate if there is a "gateway" dimension that typically initiates this cascade.

The primary limitation of this study remains its N=4 sample size. The powerful correlations observed could be an artifact of the specific, highly distinct documents chosen. A larger, more representative corpus is required to validate whether these "meta-strategy" clusters are a universal feature of political discourse or specific to this sample. Future studies should apply the CFF to a large-scale corpus of political texts, enabling more robust statistical analysis, the examination of temporal trends, and a more reliable mapping of the rhetorical styles of different political actors, parties, and movements. Another promising direction is to correlate CFF scores with real-world outcomes, such as polling data, social media engagement, or rates of political violence, to test the hypothesis that CFF-measured fragmentation has tangible social consequences.

## 7. Conclusion

This report demonstrates the analytical potential of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1 for the computational analysis of social and political discourse. Despite the significant limitation of a four-document corpus, the analysis successfully identified distinct rhetorical profiles, provided preliminary validation for the framework's oppositional structure, and uncovered patterns suggesting the existence of coherent "cohesive" and "fragmentative" meta-strategies.

The CFF's ability to quantify not just the intensity of rhetorical appeals but also their salience and the tension between them offers a significant advancement over traditional sentiment analysis. By producing nuanced metrics like the `full_cohesion_index` and the `strategic_contradiction_index`, the framework provides researchers with powerful tools to dissect the complex ways in which language is used to build or break social cohesion. This pilot study, while illustrative, lays the groundwork for future large-scale research that could use the CFF to map the landscape of public discourse and better understand the linguistic drivers of polarization and solidarity.
