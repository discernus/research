    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic example of populist economic rhetoric, making for a very clear application of the framework's dimensions. The text is heavily focused on an 'us vs. them' narrative, pitting 'the American people' against 'oligarchs' or 'billionaires'. This results in high scores for dimensions like Tribal Dominance, Envy, and Enmity, which are core to the message. The speech also contains a strong, contrasting call to action, leading to high scores in Hope, Amity (for the in-group), and Cohesive Goals (as an ultimate outcome). The rhetoric is not subtle, allowing for high confidence in scoring and evidence extraction."
