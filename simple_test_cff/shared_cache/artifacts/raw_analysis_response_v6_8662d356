    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic example of populist economic rhetoric, making the dimensions of Tribal Dominance, Envy, and Enmity particularly strong and salient. The text establishes a clear 'us vs. them' narrative, pitting 'the American people' against 'oligarchs' and 'billionaires'. Cohesive elements like Hope and Amity are present but serve as a call to action for the in-group, rather than a universal appeal."
