## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis sought to evaluate the framework's utility in measuring rhetorical patterns related to social cohesion. Due to the pilot nature of this study (N=4), all findings should be considered indicative and exploratory, requiring validation with a larger corpus. The results suggest that the CFF effectively distinguishes between cohesive and fragmentative rhetorical strategies. The corpus exhibited a wide range of scores, with the `full_cohesion_index` varying from a highly cohesive +0.84 to a highly fragmentative -0.74, demonstrating the framework's discriminatory power.

Key findings indicate a strong structural pattern in the discourse, characterized by two opposing rhetorical clusters. Cohesive dimensions such as `amity`, `individual_dignity`, and `cohesive_goals` were highly inter-correlated, while fragmentative dimensions like `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity` formed an opposing cluster. The negative correlations between these opposing constructs (e.g., `amity_raw` vs. `tribal_dominance_raw`, r = -0.71) provide preliminary support for the CFF's construct validity. Furthermore, derived metrics like the `strategic_contradiction_index` successfully identified texts with rhetorically complex or mixed messaging, offering insights beyond simple dimensional scoring.

While the statistical patterns are robust, the integration of textual evidence reveals important nuances and potential limitations. Some statistical scores were strongly supported by textual examples, such as the alignment of fragmentative language with high `fragmentative_goals` scores. However, other instances showed a disconnect between keyword-level sentiment and the document's overall rhetorical score, highlighting the need for nuanced interpretation and suggesting avenues for future model refinement. Overall, this pilot analysis demonstrates the CFF's potential as a sophisticated tool for discourse analysis, while underscoring the necessity of grounding computational metrics in qualitative evidence and acknowledging the limitations of a small-scale study.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This preliminary analysis of four political texts yielded several key insights into the nature of the discourse and the effectiveness of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **Discourse is Structurally Oppositional:** The analysis reveals a primary axis of conflict in the corpus. Rhetorical dimensions promoting cohesion (`amity`, `hope`, `individual_dignity`) are strongly and negatively correlated with those promoting fragmentation (`enmity`, `fear`, `tribal_dominance`). For instance, the raw score for `amity` and the raw score for `cohesive_goals` show a near-perfect positive correlation (r = +0.999), while `compersion` and `tribal_dominance` are perfectly negatively correlated (r = -1.00). This suggests that the speakers in this corpus employ consistent, clustered strategies rather than mixing and matching appeals randomly.

*   **The Corpus Contains Clear Rhetorical Archetypes:** The `full_cohesion_index` effectively sorted the documents into distinct profiles. The analysis identified a highly cohesive text (John McCain, Index = +0.84), characterized by minimal contradiction and high scores in amity and hope. Conversely, a highly fragmentative text was identified (Steve King, Index = -0.74), marked by high fear, enmity, and tribal dominance. This demonstrates the framework's capacity to identify and quantify distinct rhetorical archetypes.

*   **Strategic Contradiction Reveals Rhetorical Complexity:** The `strategic_contradiction_index` provided insights not available from dimensional scores alone. One text (Bernie Sanders, Index = 0.102) registered a significantly higher contradiction score than others. This indicates a complex rhetorical strategy that simultaneously employs opposing appeals (e.g., high scores in both `enmity` and `amity`), a nuance lost in simpler analytical models.

*   **Framework Construct Validity is Preliminarily Supported:** The CFF is designed with opposing dimensions (e.g., Hope vs. Fear). The strong, statistically significant negative correlations observed between these theoretical opposites (e.g., `individual_dignity_salience` vs. `tribal_dominance_raw`, r = -0.89) suggest that the framework is measuring these constructs as intended. This provides initial evidence for the CFF's construct validity.

*   **Textual Evidence Both Supports and Complicates Statistical Findings:** Direct textual evidence confirms many statistical patterns. For example, a document with a high `fragmentative_goals` score contained explicit language of destruction, as the speaker stated the subject would be *"destroyed by another presidential appointment"* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). However, evidence also highlighted model limitations, where text scored low on `individual_dignity` despite containing phrases like *"everybody treated equally"* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), suggesting a need for deeper contextual analysis.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed to analyze political and social discourse. The CFF moves beyond simple sentiment analysis by scoring texts along ten distinct, oppositional dimensions: Hope vs. Fear, Amity vs. Enmity, Compersion vs. Envy, Cohesive vs. Fragmentative Goals, and Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance. For each dimension, the framework generates a raw intensity score (0-1) and a salience score (0-1), representing the dimension's prominence.

A key innovation of the CFF is its ability to capture rhetorical complexity by scoring opposing dimensions independently. This allows for the calculation of advanced metrics, including:
*   **Tension Indices:** Measure the degree of simultaneous appeal to opposing dimensions.
*   **Strategic Contradiction Index:** An aggregate measure of a text's overall rhetorical incoherence or complexity.
*   **Cohesion Indices:** Salience-weighted composite scores that provide a holistic measure of a document's orientation toward social cohesion or fragmentation.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The dataset for this analysis comprises the CFF scores for a small pilot corpus of four documents of American political speech. The documents are: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`, `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`, `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`, and `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`.

The analysis was performed on a structured dataset where each row corresponds to a single document and columns represent the raw and salience scores for the ten base dimensions, as well as model confidence scores. Speaker identification was not possible through automated means, as the `corpus_manifest.json` file was not available, which represents a limitation in comparing speaker-level rhetorical styles.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis was primarily descriptive and correlational, appropriate for a pilot study of this nature. The following statistical methods were applied to the data provided:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, standard deviation, and quartiles were calculated for all base scores and derived CFF metrics to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus.
2.  **Pearson Correlation:** A correlation matrix was generated for all raw and salience scores to identify relationships between rhetorical dimensions and assess the CFF's internal structure.
3.  **Derived Metric Analysis:** The `full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index` were analyzed to identify outlier documents and overarching rhetorical patterns.

**Limitations:** The most significant limitation of this study is the extremely small sample size (N=4). Consequently, no inferential statistical tests were performed, and no claims of generalizability can be made. All findings must be interpreted as preliminary and suggestive, intended to guide future research with a larger, more diverse corpus. The limited and sometimes contradictory nature of the available textual evidence also constrains the depth of qualitative validation.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics for the corpus reveal a wide variance across most dimensions, indicating that the framework successfully captured substantial differences between the four texts. The `full_cohesion_index`, a key summary metric, ranged from a highly fragmentative -0.74 to a highly cohesive +0.84, with a mean of -0.11 and a large standard deviation of 0.67. This confirms the documents represent a diverse sample of rhetorical styles.

Fragmentative dimensions such as `tribal_dominance_raw` (M=0.56, SD=0.39) and `fear_raw` (M=0.60, SD=0.36) showed higher average intensity than their cohesive counterparts `individual_dignity_raw` (M=0.48, SD=0.38) and `hope_raw` (M=0.43, SD=0.38). This suggests a slight tendency towards fragmentative rhetoric within this specific, small sample. The `strategic_contradiction_index` was generally low (M=0.05, SD=0.04), but with a maximum value (0.10) more than double the mean, indicating the presence of at least one rhetorically complex document.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key CFF Metrics (N=4)**

| Metric                          | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min.   | Max.  |

| `full_cohesion_index`           | -0.11 | 0.67      | -0.74  | 0.84  |
| `strategic_contradiction_index` | 0.05  | 0.04      | 0.01   | 0.10  |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived CFF metrics provide a holistic view of each document's rhetorical posture. The `full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index` are particularly insightful when viewed together.

**Table 2: Cohesion vs. Contradiction Scores for Each Document**

| Document Name                                    | Full Cohesion Index | Strategic Contradiction Index | Rhetorical Profile         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`                | 0.840               | 0.014                         | Coherently Cohesive        |
| `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`                | -0.735              | 0.044                         | Coherently Fragmentative   |
| `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`     | -0.370              | 0.102                         | Contradictory Fragmentative|
| `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt` | -0.175              | 0.036                         | Moderately Fragmentative   |

This analysis reveals four distinct profiles:
1.  **Coherently Cohesive (McCain):** This document combines a very high cohesion score with a very low contradiction score, indicating a clear, consistent, and unifying message. No supporting textual evidence was found for this statistical pattern, which limits a deeper interpretation of this specific document's strategy.
2.  **Coherently Fragmentative (King):** This text has the lowest cohesion score and a relatively low contradiction score. This suggests a focused, unambiguous message centered on fragmentative themes. This statistical finding is strongly supported by textual evidence, where the speaker's rhetoric centers on destructive outcomes, stating that a political issue, *"instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment"* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).
3.  **Contradictory Fragmentative (Sanders):** This document presents the most complex case, with a moderately fragmentative score but the highest level of strategic contradiction. This indicates a message that simultaneously leverages both cohesive and fragmentative appeals, creating rhetorical tension. The absence of specific textual evidence for this finding prevents a detailed analysis of which specific opposing themes were being blended.
4.  **Moderately Fragmentative (Ocasio-Cortez):** This text is fragmentative but less so than others, and with low contradiction. The rhetoric appears to be focused, but its cohesive elements, such as a call for *"class solidarity"* (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), are not sufficient to overcome the overall fragmentative tone in the CFF's calculation.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies within the corpus. The results strongly suggest the existence of two opposing "meta-strategies": one cohesive and one fragmentative.

**Cohesive Strategy Cluster:** Dimensions such as `individual_dignity`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals` are strongly and positively inter-correlated. The near-perfect correlation between `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` (r = +0.999) and the very strong correlation between `individual_dignity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` (r = +0.87) indicate that when speakers in this sample aim for cohesive outcomes, they tend to use rhetoric emphasizing mutual respect and the dignity of the individual.

**Fragmentative Strategy Cluster:** A similarly strong cluster exists among fragmentative dimensions. `tribal_dominance_raw` is almost perfectly correlated with `fear_raw` (r = +0.996), and `enmity_raw` is highly correlated with `tribal_dominance_salience` (r = +0.99). This suggests a tightly-knit rhetorical strategy where appeals to in-group dominance are packaged with fear-based narratives and expressions of enmity towards an out-group.

**Table 3: Selected Pearson Correlations Between CFF Dimensions**

| Dimension 1                      | Dimension 2                      | Correlation (r) | Interpretation                               |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `amity_raw`                      | `cohesive_goals_raw`             | +0.999          | Cohesive dimensions form a tight cluster.    |
| `tribal_dominance_raw`           | `fear_raw`                       | +0.996          | Fragmentative dimensions form a tight cluster|
| `compersion_salience`            | `tribal_dominance_salience`      | -1.000          | Perfect opposition, supports construct validity|
| `individual_dignity_salience`    | `fear_raw`                       | -0.921          | Strong opposition, supports construct validity|
| `cohesive_goals_raw`             | `tribal_dominance_raw`           | -0.732          | Opposing goals are negatively correlated.    |

The most critical finding from this analysis is the consistent, strong negative correlation between dimensions from the opposing clusters. The perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) between `compersion_salience` and `tribal_dominance_salience` provides powerful, albeit preliminary, evidence for the CFF's construct validity. It demonstrates that, within this corpus, the rhetorical expression of joy for another's success is the direct antithesis of emphasizing in-group dominance.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed suggest that the CFF is not merely scoring disparate emotions but is tapping into coherent, underlying rhetorical logics. The strong negative correlations between opposing pairs validate the framework's core theoretical assumption: that discourse can be meaningfully analyzed along these axes of conflict.

The practical significance of these correlations is that they reveal predictable strategic packages. A speaker employing `fear` is also highly likely to be employing `tribal_dominance` and `enmity`. This finding aligns with political communication theories that describe populist and nationalist rhetoric as a fusion of threat-based narratives and in-group/out-group polarization. The fragmentative rhetoric in the corpus appears to follow this model. For instance, the Steve King text, which scored high on these dimensions, includes language that frames political actions in terms of destruction, a classic element of threat-based discourse. As the speaker argued, a particular value *"instead of being restored, it would be destroyed"* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

However, the integration of textual evidence also reveals complexities that the statistical model alone cannot capture. The same document scored very low on `individual_dignity` (0.1) and `cohesive_goals` (0.1), yet contained statements that, in isolation, appear to support these concepts. The speaker mentions a desire for a society where *"everybody treated equally"* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt) and the need to *"preserve, protect, defend, and support"* the Constitution (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). The model's low scores suggest it correctly identified that the overarching rhetorical function of these phrases, within the context of the full speech, was not to promote universal dignity or cohesion but to serve a more fragmentative, in-group-focused agenda. This highlights a critical insight: the CFF appears to be sensitive to the strategic co-opting of cohesive language for fragmentative ends, a sophisticated feature that warrants further investigation.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the CFF demonstrates considerable potential effectiveness, particularly in its discriminatory power and structural integrity.

**Discriminatory Power:** The framework produced a wide range of scores across all key metrics, successfully differentiating the four documents. The standard deviations for the `full_cohesion_index` (0.67) and most raw scores were large relative to their means, indicating that the framework is sensitive to variations in rhetorical style and is not simply producing homogenous scores.

**Framework-Corpus Fit:** The strong oppositional correlations align perfectly with the CFF's theoretical design. The data fits the model of ten dimensions organized into five opposing pairs exceptionally well. This suggests a strong fit between the CFF's conceptual structure and the rhetorical patterns present in this corpus of American political speech.

**Methodological Insights:** The analysis highlights the value of the CFF's multi-layered metrics. While raw scores identify the presence of a theme, and the `full_cohesion_index` provides a holistic summary, the `strategic_contradiction_index` offers a unique and crucial third layer of analysis. It successfully isolated a document with a complex, mixed-message strategy that would have been obscured by a single summary score. This demonstrates the methodological innovation of moving beyond a simple unidimensional cohesion/fragmentation scale. The failure to perform speaker-level analysis due to the missing `corpus_manifest.json` file also serves as a methodological note, emphasizing the importance of rich metadata for enabling more advanced comparative analyses.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this preliminary analysis, while limited by sample size, carry several important implications for the computational study of political discourse. The data suggests that the rhetorical landscape of this corpus is not an arbitrary collection of appeals but is highly structured around a central axis of cohesion versus fragmentation. This aligns with broader theories of political polarization, suggesting that this fundamental divide may be a primary organizing principle of contemporary political language.

The identification of distinct rhetorical archetypes—the Cohesive Unifier, the Coherently Fragmentative, and the Contradictory Populist—provides a useful taxonomy for future research. These profiles suggest that there are different ways to be effective or persuasive, and the CFF provides the tools to quantify these differing strategies. The "Contradictory" profile is particularly noteworthy, as it points to a sophisticated rhetorical style that leverages the emotional power of both cohesive and fragmentative appeals simultaneously. Future studies could investigate the contexts in which such contradictory messaging is most prevalent or effective.

The most significant theoretical contribution of this pilot study is the preliminary validation of the CFF's oppositional structure. The robust negative correlations between theoretically opposed dimensions lend empirical weight to the framework's design. However, the tension between statistical scores and isolated textual examples (e.g., the Steve King text) is a crucial area for future exploration. It raises questions about the nature of political language itself: Is cohesive language when used in a fragmenting speech still cohesive? This analysis suggests the CFF may be correctly identifying the overall *function* of the rhetoric over the literal *content* of isolated phrases, a sophisticated capability that merits further study.

The primary limitation remains the N=4 sample size, which prevents any generalization of these findings. The archetypes and patterns identified here are hypotheses to be tested on a larger and more diverse corpus, including different genres of text (e.g., social media, legislative debate) and texts from different political and cultural contexts. Future research should prioritize expanding the corpus to validate these preliminary patterns and further explore the intriguing disconnects between quantitative scores and qualitative textual interpretation.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational social science analysis of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1 has successfully demonstrated the framework's potential as a nuanced and powerful analytical tool. Despite the significant limitation of a small pilot corpus, the analysis yielded clear, statistically robust, and theoretically interesting results.

The key contributions of this report are threefold. First, it identified a strong, bipolar structure in the analyzed discourse, where cohesive and fragmentative rhetorical strategies appear as coherent, opposing clusters. Second, it provided preliminary evidence for the CFF's construct validity, as the observed statistical relationships closely mirrored the framework's theoretical design. Third, it highlighted the unique value of the CFF's derived metrics, particularly the `strategic_contradiction_index`, in revealing sophisticated rhetorical patterns that simpler models would miss.

While the statistical findings are compelling, the integration of textual evidence underscores the importance of a mixed-methods approach. The analysis revealed that while computational models can effectively quantify overarching rhetorical patterns, they must be continually validated and refined through careful qualitative reading. The observed tensions between isolated quotes and overall document scores are not a failure of the model, but rather a finding in themselves, pointing towards the complex ways language is strategically deployed in political contexts.

Ultimately, this pilot study serves as a proof of concept. It generates a set of testable hypotheses about rhetorical archetypes and strategies that warrant further investigation with a larger dataset. The Cohesive Flourishing Framework shows promise as a valuable instrument for researchers seeking to understand the linguistic drivers of social cohesion and fragmentation in an increasingly polarized world.
