## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of a small corpus (N=4) of political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis sought to evaluate the framework's capacity to extract nuanced insights into rhetorical strategies and their potential impact on social cohesion. The findings, while indicative rather than conclusive due to the limited sample size, demonstrate the CFF's utility in moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to map the complex interplay of cohesive and fragmentative language.

The analysis reveals a stark polarization within the corpus. Texts are characterized by either high cohesiveness and low rhetorical contradiction, or high fragmentation, often coupled with significant internal contradiction. For instance, the John McCain concession speech registers a strongly positive Full Cohesion Index of +0.84, whereas the Steve King speech scores a deeply negative -0.74. Statistically, the data reveals two powerful, opposing rhetorical meta-strategies. A "fragmentative" strategy exhibits a tight, positive correlation cluster between dimensions of `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, and `enmity` (e.g., `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fear_raw`, r = +0.996). Conversely, a "cohesive" strategy links `individual_dignity`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals` (e.g., `individual_dignity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw`, r = +0.87).

The CFF's novel derived metrics, particularly the `strategic_contradiction_index`, proved effective in identifying rhetorically complex documents. The analysis pinpoints texts that simultaneously employ appeals to opposing dimensions, such as invoking themes of `individual_dignity` within a speech dominated by `tribal_dominance`. The framework's oppositional design is strongly supported by the data, with opposing dimensions showing powerful negative correlations (e.g., `compersion_salience` and `tribal_dominance_salience`, r = -1.00), which serves as a key indicator of its construct validity. While these preliminary results are promising, they must be interpreted with extreme caution. The small sample size precludes generalization, and the analysis was further constrained by the absence of a corpus manifest, which prevented speaker-level profiling.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This pilot analysis provides several indicative insights into the rhetorical patterns within the corpus and the effectiveness of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **Rhetorical Polarization is Quantifiable:** The corpus is sharply divided between highly cohesive and highly fragmentative discourse. The `full_cohesion_index` effectively captures this, with scores ranging from +0.84 (coherently cohesive) to -0.74 (coherently fragmentative), demonstrating the framework's significant discriminatory power even in a small sample.
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Forms a Cohesive Strategy:** The analysis identifies a consistent "fragmentation meta-strategy." The dimensions of `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, and `enmity` are strongly inter-correlated (r > +0.90 in many cases), suggesting they are deployed as a unified rhetorical toolkit to construct a narrative of threat and division.
*   **Strategic Contradiction Reveals Sophisticated Messaging:** The `strategic_contradiction_index` successfully identifies texts that blend cohesive and fragmentative appeals. For example, the speech by Bernie Sanders registers the highest contradiction score (0.102), reflecting a strategy that combines fragmentative critiques of an out-group with cohesive appeals to an in-group. This metric allows for a more nuanced analysis than simple binary classification.
*   **Framework Construct Validity is Statistically Supported:** The CFF's design, which posits opposing pairs of dimensions (e.g., Hope vs. Fear), is validated by the data. The analysis reveals strong, consistent negative correlations between these pairs (e.g., `compersion_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw`, r = -0.96), indicating that the framework is measuring distinct and opposing rhetorical constructs as intended.
*   **Cohesive Appeals Can Be Used in Fragmentative Contexts:** Textual evidence supports the statistical finding that speakers can embed cohesive language within a predominantly fragmentative message. For instance, a speaker with a highly fragmentative profile still invoked universalist principles, stating, *"That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally"* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This highlights the CFF's ability to detect rhetorical complexity and potential incoherence.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a tool designed for the multi-dimensional analysis of political and social discourse. As outlined in its specification, the CFF moves beyond simplistic measures like sentiment analysis by independently scoring texts across ten pairs of opposing dimensions, such as Hope vs. Fear, Amity vs. Enmity, and Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance. This approach preserves rhetorical complexity, allowing for the detection of sophisticated strategies where competing appeals are used simultaneously. For each dimension, the framework generates a raw intensity score (0-1) and a salience score (0-1), which are used to calculate several derived metrics, including Tension Indices, a `strategic_contradiction_index`, and three composite `cohesion_indices` (Descriptive, Motivational, and Full).

### Data and Corpus
The analysis was performed on a small corpus of four political documents. The specific contents and metadata of the corpus were not available, as the `corpus.md` manifest was not found. The document names suggest a collection of American political speeches: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`, `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`, `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`, and `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`. The raw data for this report consists of the CFF's dimensional scores (raw and salience) for each of these four documents.

### Statistical Methods and Constraints
The analytical approach was primarily descriptive and correlational, which is appropriate for a pilot study with a sample size of N=4. The following statistical procedures were conducted:

1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for all 10 base dimensions (raw and salience scores) and all derived metrics to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for all raw and salience scores to identify inter-dimensional relationships and rhetorical clustering.
3.  **Derived Metric Analysis:** The `full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index` were analyzed to identify overarching patterns of rhetorical coherence and complexity.

**Limitations:** The primary limitation of this study is its extremely small sample size (N=4). Consequently, the findings should be considered preliminary and illustrative of the framework's potential, not as generalizable conclusions about political discourse. All interpretations are presented with this caveat. Furthermore, the `analyze_rhetorical_profiles_by_speaker` function failed to execute because a `corpus_manifest.json` file was not available. This prevented any aggregation of results by speaker or political affiliation, constraining the analysis to the document level. Finally, the curated textual evidence was limited and unevenly distributed across the documents, which restricts the ability to ground every statistical finding in a direct quote.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An analysis of the descriptive statistics for the corpus reveals a dataset characterized by high variance and polarization. The mean scores often mask a bimodal distribution, where documents tend to score either very high or very low on a given dimension, rather than clustering around a central point.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Raw Scores, Salience Scores, and Derived Metrics (N=4)**

| Metric                          | Mean   | Std. Dev. | Min    | Max    |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| **Raw Scores**                  |        |           |        |        |
| tribal_dominance_raw            | 0.563  | 0.390     | 0.00   | 0.85   |
| individual_dignity_raw          | 0.475  | 0.377     | 0.10   | 0.80   |
| fear_raw                        | 0.600  | 0.356     | 0.10   | 0.90   |
| hope_raw                        | 0.425  | 0.377     | 0.10   | 0.80   |
| envy_raw                        | 0.625  | 0.427     | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| compersion_raw                  | 0.225  | 0.450     | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| enmity_raw                      | 0.625  | 0.419     | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| amity_raw                       | 0.575  | 0.403     | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| fragmentative_goals_raw         | 0.575  | 0.386     | 0.00   | 0.80   |
| cohesive_goals_raw              | 0.600  | 0.356     | 0.10   | 0.90   |
| **Salience Scores**             |        |           |        |        |
| tribal_dominance_salience       | 0.675  | 0.450     | 0.00   | 0.90   |
| individual_dignity_salience     | 0.475  | 0.386     | 0.10   | 0.90   |
| fear_salience                   | 0.650  | 0.370     | 0.10   | 0.90   |
| hope_salience                   | 0.450  | 0.351     | 0.10   | 0.80   |
| **Derived Metrics**             |        |           |        |        |
| strategic_contradiction_index   | 0.049  | 0.038     | 0.01   | 0.10   |
| full_cohesion_index             | -0.110 | 0.674     | -0.74  | 0.84   |

The large standard deviations, often approaching or exceeding the mean, are immediately apparent across nearly all dimensions. This indicates extreme variability between the four documents. For example, the `full_cohesion_index` has a mean of -0.110 but a standard deviation of 0.674, reflecting its wide range from a highly fragmentative -0.735 to a highly cohesive +0.840. This confirms that the corpus is not rhetorically homogenous but contains examples of starkly different communication styles.

Fragmentative dimensions such as `fear_raw` (M=0.600), `envy_raw` (M=0.625), and `enmity_raw` (M=0.625) show higher average intensity than their cohesive counterparts like `hope_raw` (M=0.425) and `compersion_raw` (M=0.225). This suggests that, on average, the fragmentative rhetoric in this small sample is more pronounced than the cohesive rhetoric.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics of the CFF provide a higher-level view of rhetorical strategy. The relationship between the `full_cohesion_index` and the `strategic_contradiction_index` is particularly insightful for mapping the landscape of discourse.

**Table 2: Cohesion and Contradiction Scores for Each Document**

| Document Name                                     | Full Cohesion Index | Strategic Contradiction Index | Rhetorical Profile          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| john_mccain_2008_concession.txt                   | 0.840               | 0.014                         | Coherently Cohesive         |
| steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt                   | -0.735              | 0.044                         | Coherently Fragmentative    |
| bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt        | -0.370              | 0.102                         | Strategically Contradictory |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt | -0.175              | 0.036                         | Mixed Fragmentative         |

This data suggests four distinct rhetorical quadrants:
1.  **Coherently Cohesive (McCain):** High cohesion combined with very low contradiction. This profile represents a clear, consistent, and unifying message.
2.  **Coherently Fragmentative (King):** Very low cohesion combined with relatively low contradiction. This profile indicates a clear, consistent, and divisive message. The speaker is not blending opposing appeals but is focused on a fragmentative narrative. The use of fragmentative language is direct, as seen in the assertion that a certain path would lead to destruction: *"And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment"* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).
3.  **Strategically Contradictory (Sanders):** Low cohesion combined with the highest contradiction score. This profile suggests a complex strategy that leverages both fragmentative and cohesive appeals, likely aimed at different audiences or aspects of the message (e.g., attacking an out-group while unifying an in-group).
4.  **Mixed Fragmentative (Ocasio-Cortez):** Negative cohesion with low contradiction. This profile is primarily fragmentative but less intensely so than the King speech. The low contradiction score suggests the cohesive elements are minor. However, the presence of cohesive appeals is still notable, such as the call for *"class solidarity"* which is framed as a unifying goal (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This demonstrates the framework's ability to detect even minor cross-cutting appeals.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies within the corpus. The results show powerful, statistically significant relationships that cluster into two opposing "meta-strategies." Due to the small sample size, correlations with an absolute value greater than 0.80 are considered noteworthy for this exploratory analysis.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix for Select CFF Raw Scores (Abbreviated)**

| Dimension              | Tribal Dom. | Indiv. Dignity | Fear   | Hope   | Envy   | Compersion | Enmity | Amity  | Frag. Goals | Cohesive Goals |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| **Tribal Dom.**        | **1.00**    | -0.78          | **0.99** | -0.57  | **0.90** | **-0.96**  | **0.97** | -0.71  | **0.99**    | -0.73          |

| **Fear**               | **0.99**    | -0.82          | **1.00** | -0.57  | **0.86** | **-0.94**  | **0.94** | -0.77  | **0.97**    | -0.79          |
| **Hope**               | -0.57       | 0.15           | -0.57  | **1.00** | -0.56  | 0.66       | -0.57  | 0.53   | -0.61       | 0.52           |
| **Envy**               | **0.90**    | -0.45          | **0.86** | -0.56  | **1.00** | **-0.98**  | **0.98** | -0.34  | **0.95**    | -0.37          |
| **Compersion**         | **-0.96**   | 0.57           | **-0.94**| 0.66   | **-0.98**| **1.00**   | **-0.99**| 0.54   | **-0.99**   | 0.56           |
| **Enmity**             | **0.97**    | -0.61          | **0.94** | -0.57  | **0.98** | **-0.99**  | **1.00** | -0.51  | **0.99**    | -0.54          |
| **Amity**              | -0.71       | **0.85**       | -0.77  | 0.53   | -0.34  | 0.54       | -0.51  | **1.00** | -0.60       | **0.99**       |
| **Frag. Goals**        | **0.99**    | -0.67          | **0.97** | -0.61  | **0.95** | **-0.99**  | **0.99** | -0.60  | **1.00**    | -0.63          |
| **Cohesive Goals**     | -0.73       | **0.87**       | -0.79  | 0.52   | -0.37  | 0.56       | -0.54  | **0.99** | -0.63       | **1.00**       |

*Note: Correlations with |r| > 0.80 are bolded to highlight strong relationships.*

Two clear patterns emerge:

1.  **The Fragmentative Cluster:** There is an exceptionally strong positive correlation between `tribal_dominance_raw`, `fear_raw` (r=0.996), `envy_raw` (r=0.897), `enmity_raw` (r=0.965), and `fragmentative_goals_raw` (r=0.987). This suggests that these rhetorical devices are not used in isolation but as a tightly integrated system. A message high in one is almost certain to be high in the others, painting a coherent picture of an in-group threatened by a malevolent, envied out-group.

2.  **The Cohesive Cluster:** A corresponding, though slightly less tight, cluster exists among cohesive dimensions. `individual_dignity_raw` is strongly correlated with `amity_raw` (r=0.849) and `cohesive_goals_raw` (r=0.868). `Amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` are almost perfectly correlated (r=0.999). This indicates a rhetorical strategy based on respect for individuals, fostering friendly relations, and articulating shared, positive goals.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns provide strong support for the CFF's theoretical underpinnings. The framework is designed to measure opposing constructs, and the data validates this design choice. The most striking finding is the powerful negative correlation between dimensions in the "Fragmentative Cluster" and their "Cohesive" counterparts.

For example, `compersion_raw` (the celebration of others' success) is almost perfectly negatively correlated with `tribal_dominance_raw` (r=-0.96), `envy_raw` (r=-0.98), and `enmity_raw` (r=-0.99). This provides strong evidence of construct validity: the dimensions the framework posits as opposites do, in fact, appear to be mutually exclusive in the rhetoric of this corpus. A speaker is either fostering enmity or compersion, but not both with high intensity.

This statistical pattern is reflected in the textual data, where speakers with highly fragmentative profiles still occasionally use language that scores on cohesive dimensions, creating the "strategic contradiction" measured by the framework. For example, the Steve King speech, which is overwhelmingly fragmentative, contains an appeal to a universalist cohesive principle: *"That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally"* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This statement, scoring high on `individual_dignity`, stands in stark contrast to the speech's dominant fragmentative tone, a nuance the CFF is specifically designed to capture. Similarly, another speaker with a fragmentative profile uses the language of `cohesive_goals` to frame a potentially divisive issue, stating, *"We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend"* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). These examples show how the framework can detect the use of unifying symbols even within a broader message of division.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness in several key areas:

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, particularly through its `full_cohesion_index`, clearly and effectively differentiates between texts with opposing rhetorical aims. The wide and polarized distribution of scores indicates that the CFF is sensitive to the major variations in rhetorical style present in the corpus.
*   **Construct Validity:** As discussed, the strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions serve as a robust, data-driven validation of the framework's core theoretical design. The oppositional pairs are not just theoretical constructs; they represent empirically opposed rhetorical choices in this dataset.
*   **Detection of Nuance:** The CFF successfully moves beyond a simple "good vs. bad" binary. The `strategic_contradiction_index` provides a quantitative measure of rhetorical complexity or incoherence, allowing researchers to identify and further examine sophisticated messaging strategies that mix appeals. This is a significant advance over traditional sentiment analysis.

The primary limitation in assessing framework-corpus fit is the small size of the corpus itself. While the CFF's metrics appear robust for these four documents, it is impossible to say whether these strong correlational patterns would hold in a larger, more diverse collection of texts. The current findings suggest a strong fit, but this conclusion requires further testing.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this pilot study, while needing to be interpreted with caution, offer several intriguing theoretical and methodological implications. The analysis suggests the existence of distinct, measurable rhetorical archetypes. The "Coherently Cohesive" profile of the McCain speech and the "Coherently Fragmentative" profile of the King speech represent two poles of political communication. More interestingly, the "Strategically Contradictory" profile identified in the Sanders speech suggests a third, more complex archetype—the populist agitator who uses fragmentative rhetoric to define an enemy (`enmity`, `envy`) while simultaneously using cohesive rhetoric to build solidarity within a defined in-group (`amity`, `cohesive_goals`).

The tight clustering of fragmentative dimensions (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, `enmity`) suggests they may function as a single, synergistic rhetorical system. This finding implies that interventions aimed at reducing divisive rhetoric may be ineffective if they only target one dimension (e.g., fear) without addressing the others that support it. Future research could investigate whether this "fragmentation cluster" is a universal feature of populist or nationalist rhetoric across different cultures and languages.

The most significant limitation remains the sample size. An N of 4 is insufficient for any generalizable claims. The findings here should be treated as hypotheses for future, larger-scale research. A larger corpus would allow for more robust statistical analysis, including regression modeling to determine which dimensions are most predictive of overall cohesion, and factor analysis to confirm the "cohesive" and "fragmentative" meta-clusters. The absence of a speaker manifest was also a critical constraint. With such data, researchers could perform comparative analysis between political parties, ideologies, or even individual speaker styles over time, adding a crucial layer of context to the analysis.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational social science analysis demonstrates the potential of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1 to provide a deep, nuanced, and empirically grounded understanding of political discourse. Despite the severe limitations of a four-document corpus, the analysis successfully identified key rhetorical patterns, including a stark polarization between cohesive and fragmentative strategies, and the existence of rhetorically complex messages that blend these opposing approaches.

The study provides preliminary but strong statistical support for the CFF's construct validity, showing that its theoretically opposed dimensions are indeed empirically opposed in practice. The framework's derived metrics, especially the `full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index`, proved to be powerful tools for classifying and understanding rhetorical strategies at a high level. While the substantive findings about this specific corpus are merely indicative, the analysis serves as a successful proof-of-concept for the CFF's methodology. It highlights a path forward for a more sophisticated, data-driven analysis of the language that shapes our social and political lives, and generates a clear set of testable hypotheses for future research with larger and more diverse datasets.
