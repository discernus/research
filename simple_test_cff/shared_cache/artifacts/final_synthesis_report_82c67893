## 1. Executive Summary

This computational social science analysis utilizes the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1 to dissect the rhetorical structure of a diverse four-document corpus of American political speech. The analysis reveals a political landscape characterized by profound rhetorical division, with discourse predominantly leaning towards social fragmentation. The corpus-wide mean for the `full_cohesion_index`, the CFF's primary metric, is negative (M = -0.149), indicating that, on average, the analyzed language is more likely to undermine than to build social cohesion. This fragmentative tendency is driven by strong and consistent appeals to **Fear** (M = 0.65), **Enmity** (M = 0.65), and **Tribal Dominance** (M = 0.58).

Two starkly contrasting rhetorical archetypes emerge from the data. The first, a "Fragmenting Populist" style, is exemplified by the speeches of Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Steve King. This archetype is defined by a powerful synergy between fragmentative dimensions, particularly the near-perfect correlation between **Fear** and **Tribal Dominance** (r = 0.992). Within this archetype, two sub-variants are visible: a left-populist version focused on economic oligarchy and a right-populist version focused on national and cultural threats. The second archetype, a "Unifying Institutionalist" style, is represented as a statistical outlier by John McCain's 2008 concession speech. This text is characterized by high scores in **Amity**, **Compersion**, and **Individual Dignity**, resulting in a strongly positive cohesion score that stands in sharp opposition to the rest of the corpus.

Methodologically, the analysis provides strong validation for the CFF's design. The consistent, strong negative correlations between opposing constructs (e.g., **Tribal Dominance** vs. **Individual Dignity**, r = -0.670; **Fear** vs. **Hope**, r = -0.559) confirm the framework's construct validity. The CFF's derived metrics, such as the Cohesion and Tension Indices, successfully quantified the overall rhetorical thrust and complexity of each text, demonstrating the framework's capacity to move beyond simple sentiment analysis to reveal sophisticated meta-strategies in political communication. The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=4), which means these findings illustrate the CFF's analytical potential rather than providing generalizable conclusions about the entirety of political discourse.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Dominates the Corpus:** The overall rhetorical landscape of the analyzed texts is tilted towards fragmentation. The average `full_cohesion_index` is negative (-0.149), driven by high mean scores for fragmentative dimensions like **Fear** (0.65), **Enmity** (0.65), and **Tribal Dominance** (0.58) compared to their cohesive counterparts.
*   **A "Fragmentative Syndrome" Emerges:** A powerful cluster of fragmentative dimensions operates in near-perfect unison. **Tribal Dominance** is almost perfectly correlated with **Fear** (r = 0.992) and **Fragmentative Goals** (r = 0.993). This indicates a tightly-woven rhetorical strategy where defining an in-group against a threatening out-group is the central mechanism for mobilizing action.
*   **Two Opposing Rhetorical Archetypes Identified:** The data reveals two distinct communication models. The "Fragmenting Populist" (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, King) uses high levels of fear and enmity to define a virtuous "people" against a corrupt elite or external threat. In stark contrast, the "Unifying Institutionalist" (McCain) employs high levels of **Compersion** (celebrating an opponent's success) and **Amity** to bridge political divides, representing a fundamentally different approach to democratic discourse.
*   **The Absence of Compersion is a Defining Feature of Fragmentation:** The mean score for **Compersion** (0.23) is the lowest of all cohesive dimensions, and its rhetorical opposite, **Envy** (0.55), is more than twice as prevalent. Furthermore, the `success_tension` index is zero across the entire corpus, indicating a complete lack of rhetorical complexity on this axis. Fragmentative speakers in this corpus do not mix appeals to envy with celebrations of legitimate success; they rely solely on narratives of illegitimate gain.
*   **The CFF Demonstrates Strong Construct Validity:** The framework's oppositional design is validated by the data. Cohesive dimensions are consistently and strongly negatively correlated with their fragmentative opposites. For instance, the use of **Compersion** is almost perfectly negatively correlated with the use of **Tribal Dominance** (r = -0.993), demonstrating that these concepts function as true rhetorical opposites in this context.
*   **Rhetoric is More Polarized than Complex:** The `strategic_contradiction_index` is consistently low across the corpus (M = 0.057). This suggests that the speakers are not employing sophisticated strategies that blend opposing appeals (e.g., hope and fear). Instead, their rhetoric is overwhelmingly one-sided, either cohesive or fragmentative, reflecting a highly polarized communication environment.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This analysis is situated at the intersection of computational linguistics, political science, and communication studies. The **Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF)** builds upon a rich history of discourse analysis but advances the field by operationalizing concepts central to the study of democratic health and social capital (Putnam, 2000). Its focus on oppositional pairs like **Amity/Enmity** and **Hope/Fear** directly engages with the literature on **affective polarization**, which documents the rise of political identity based on animosity toward opposing partisans rather than on policy disagreement (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015).

The CFF's dimensions of **Tribal Dominance**, **Envy**, and **Enmity** provide a quantitative lens for examining **populist rhetoric**. As defined by scholars like Cas Mudde (2004) and Benjamin Moffitt (2016), populism often constructs a Manichean worldview pitting a virtuous "people" against a corrupt and self-serving "elite." The framework's metrics allow us to measure the intensity of this construction. For example, high **Tribal Dominance** scores reflect the creation of a moral in-group, while high **Envy** scores quantify the portrayal of the elite's success as illegitimate. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated, "We are witnessing an oligarchy in America. And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This statement perfectly encapsulates the synergy of these dimensions.

Furthermore, the framework's emphasis on emotion aligns with research by Ted Brader (2006), who demonstrated that emotional appeals—particularly fear and enthusiasm (hope)—are not mere rhetorical flourishes but are central to political persuasion and mobilization. The CFF's ability to independently score **Hope** and **Fear** allows for a nuanced analysis that can detect whether a speaker is primarily demobilizing opponents through fear or mobilizing supporters through hope, or attempting a complex combination of both.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed to analyze discourse for its potential impact on social cohesion. The CFF operationalizes five key axes of communication, each composed of an opposing pair of rhetorical dimensions:

1.  **Identity Axis:** Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity
2.  **Emotional Axis:** Fear vs. Hope
3.  **Success Axis:** Envy vs. Compersion
4.  **Relational Axis:** Enmity vs. Amity
5.  **Goal Axis:** Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals

For each dimension, the framework produces a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1), a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1), and a `confidence` score. A key innovation of the CFF is its independent scoring of opposing dimensions, allowing for the measurement of rhetorical complexity and contradiction.

### Data and Corpus

The analysis was performed on a small but diverse corpus of four documents (N=4) of American political speeches. The corpus includes speeches from Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Steve King, and John McCain, representing a range of ideological positions and rhetorical contexts (e.g., campaign rally, House floor speech, election concession). While the small sample size precludes generalization, it is sufficient for demonstrating the CFF's analytical capabilities and identifying distinct rhetorical archetypes.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational, interpreting the statistical outputs generated by the automated analysis agent. The following methods were used:

1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (M), Standard Deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum values were calculated for all raw scores and derived indices to understand central tendencies and variance.
2.  **Derived Metrics:** Three **Cohesion Indices** (`descriptive`, `motivational`, `full`) were calculated to provide a holistic measure of each text's rhetorical orientation, ranging from -1.0 (maximally fragmentative) to +1.0 (maximally cohesive). Five **Tension Indices** and an overall **Strategic Contradiction Index** were calculated to measure the degree to which speakers simultaneously employ opposing rhetorical appeals.
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for all raw scores and derived indices to identify patterns of co-occurrence and reveal underlying rhetorical strategies.
4.  **Framework Validation:** The oppositional nature of the CFF was assessed by examining the negative correlations between paired dimensions (e.g., Hope vs. Fear). Strong negative correlations are interpreted as evidence of the framework's construct validity.

**Limitations:** The most significant limitation is the sample size of N=4. All statistical findings, particularly correlations, should be interpreted as exploratory and illustrative of the types of insights the CFF can generate. They describe powerful patterns *within this specific corpus* but cannot be generalized to all political speech without a much larger dataset. The analysis treats the provided statistical results as definitive facts and does not perform inferential tests (e.g., p-values) due to the small sample size, which would render them meaningless.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics: A Landscape of Conflict

An examination of the descriptive statistics across the corpus reveals a rhetorical environment dominated by fragmentative language. The mean scores for all five fragmentative dimensions are consistently higher than their cohesive counterparts.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Raw Score Dimensions (N=4)**
| Dimension | Type | Mean | Std. Dev. | Min | Max |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tribal Dominance** | Fragmentative | **0.575** | 0.386 | 0.00 | 0.80 |
| Individual Dignity | Cohesive | 0.425 | 0.435 | 0.00 | 0.80 |
| **Fear** | Fragmentative | **0.650** | 0.370 | 0.10 | 0.90 |
| Hope | Cohesive | 0.475 | 0.330 | 0.00 | 0.70 |
| **Envy** | Fragmentative | **0.550** | 0.436 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Compersion | Cohesive | 0.225 | 0.450 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| **Enmity** | Fragmentative | **0.650** | 0.436 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| Amity | Cohesive | 0.550 | 0.404 | 0.00 | 0.90 |
| **Fragmentative Goals** | Fragmentative | **0.600** | 0.400 | 0.00 | 0.80 |
| Cohesive Goals | Cohesive | 0.550 | 0.351 | 0.20 | 0.90 |

The dimensions of **Fear** (M=0.65) and **Enmity** (M=0.65) are the most prevalent rhetorical frames in the corpus. This indicates a general tendency to define political situations in terms of threats and to identify hostile out-groups. This is vividly illustrated in the discourse of Steve King, who stated: "this illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body... It's another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This single passage combines high-intensity **Fear** with a clear demarcation of an enemy (**Enmity**).

Conversely, the cohesive dimensions are less prominent. The least-used cohesive appeal is **Compersion** (M=0.225), the act of celebrating the legitimate success of others. Its low mean score is driven by its complete absence in several texts. For example, the analysis of one of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's speeches notes: "No evidence found for this dimension. The speech's focus is on the illegitimate success of an oligarchy, not celebrating the success of others. Its absence is a significant feature of the text" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This absence is as analytically significant as the presence of other dimensions, pointing to a zero-sum worldview.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Quantifying Cohesion and Complexity

The CFF's derived indices quantify the overall rhetorical effect of the texts. The Cohesion Indices confirm the fragmentative tilt observed in the descriptive statistics, while the Tension Indices reveal a lack of sophisticated rhetorical blending.

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Cohesion Indices (N=4)**
| Index | Mean | Std. Dev. | Min | Max | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Descriptive Cohesion | -0.196 | 0.678 | -0.785 | 0.781 | Negative (Fragmentative) |
| Motivational Cohesion | -0.139 | 0.662 | -0.692 | 0.813 | Negative (Fragmentative) |
| **Full Cohesion Index** | **-0.149** | **0.670** | **-0.716** | **0.802** | **Negative (Fragmentative)** |

The negative mean for the `full_cohesion_index` (M = -0.149) serves as the single most important top-line finding, confirming that the corpus, as a whole, is rhetorically divisive. The wide standard deviation (SD = 0.670) and the large range from -0.716 to 0.802 indicate, however, that the corpus is not monolithically fragmentative but contains texts with dramatically different rhetorical profiles.

**Table 3: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Tension Indices (N=4)**
| Index | Mean | Std. Dev. | Min | Max | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Identity Tension | 0.055 | 0.068 | 0.000 | 0.140 | Very Low |
| Emotional Tension | 0.083 | 0.074 | 0.000 | 0.150 | Low |
| Success Tension | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | Zero |
| Relational Tension | 0.070 | 0.095 | 0.000 | 0.200 | Low |
| Goal Tension | 0.077 | 0.061 | 0.000 | 0.150 | Low |
| **Strategic Contradiction** | **0.057** | **0.053** | **0.008** | **0.114** | **Very Low** |

The Tension Indices are uniformly low, with the overall `strategic_contradiction_index` having a mean of just 0.057. This is a crucial finding: the speakers in this corpus do not engage in complex rhetoric that balances opposing frames. They do not, for example, pair a message of hope with a message of fear to create a nuanced call to action. Instead, the discourse is highly polarized and one-sided. The `success_tension` score of zero is particularly stark. It means that no text in the corpus simultaneously invoked both **Envy** and **Compersion**. Speakers either framed others' success as illegitimate and threatening (Envy) or as admirable and inspiring (Compersion), but never both. This points to a Manichean, zero-sum framing of success.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis: The Architecture of Division

The correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of the rhetorical strategies within the corpus. It demonstrates both the CFF's internal validity and the existence of powerful, predictable "syndromes" of communication.

The most striking finding is the existence of two powerful, internally consistent, and mutually exclusive rhetorical clusters.

**The Fragmentative Cluster:** The fragmenting dimensions show extremely high positive correlations with each other.
*   `tribal_dominance` & `fear`: **r = 0.992**
*   `tribal_dominance` & `enmity`: **r = 0.980**
*   `tribal_dominance` & `fragmentative_goals`: **r = 0.993**
*   `fear` & `enmity`: **r = 0.972**

This "fragmentative syndrome" suggests a tightly integrated rhetorical strategy: defining a tribal in-group (`tribal_dominance`) is achieved by stoking fear of a threat (`fear`) posed by a designated enemy (`enmity`), which in turn justifies destructive or oppositional goals (`fragmentative_goals`). This pattern is evident in the language of Bernie Sanders, who links an oligarchic tribe to destructive actions: "They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

**The Cohesive Cluster:** The cohesive dimensions are also positively correlated with each other, though not as tightly as their fragmentative counterparts.
*   `individual_dignity` & `amity`: **r = 0.901**
*   `individual_dignity` & `cohesive_goals`: **r = 0.993**
*   `amity` & `cohesive_goals`: **r = 0.916**

This indicates a strategy where affirming the dignity of individuals (`individual_dignity`) is linked to building bridges (`amity`) and pursuing constructive, shared objectives (`cohesive_goals`). This is the core of John McCain's speech: "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

**Framework Validation:** The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions provide powerful evidence for the CFF's construct validity.
*   `full_cohesion_index` & `tribal_dominance`: **r = -0.975**
*   `full_cohesion_index` & `fear`: **r = -0.973**
*   `compersion` & `tribal_dominance`: **r = -0.993**
*   `compersion` & `fragmentative_goals`: **r = -1.000**

The perfect negative correlation between **Compersion** and **Fragmentative Goals** is a profound finding. It suggests that, within this dataset, the act of celebrating an opponent's success is the rhetorical antithesis of pursuing a goal to defeat or dismantle something. This validates the CFF's theoretical assumption that these are opposing concepts and reveals a deep structural logic in the analyzed political language.

**Table 4: Selected Pearson Correlations for Key CFF Dimensions**
| | Full Cohesion Index | Tribal Dominance | Fear | Compersion | Amity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Cohesion Index** | **1.000** | | | | |
| **Tribal Dominance** | **-0.975** | 1.000 | | | |
| **Fear** | **-0.973** | **0.992** | 1.000 | | |
| **Compersion** | **0.946** | **-0.993** | **-0.992** | 1.000 | |
| **Amity** | **0.803** | -0.651 | -0.669 | 0.577 | 1.000 |
| **Fragmentative Goals** | **-0.946** | **0.993** | **0.992** | **-1.000** | -0.577 |
*Note: Correlations with an absolute value > 0.9 are bolded to indicate very strong relationships.*

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights: Uncovering Rhetorical Archetypes

The statistical patterns allow for the identification of clear rhetorical archetypes, demonstrating that political actors deploy these dimensions in structured, recognizable ways.

**Archetype 1: The Fragmenting Populist (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, King)**
This is the dominant archetype in the corpus. It is characterized by high scores on the fragmentative cluster dimensions and a negative cohesion index. Its core strategy is to construct a virtuous in-group ("the people," "working people") and define it against a powerful, malevolent out-group ("oligarchs," "billionaires," "illegal criminal aliens"). This archetype leverages **Fear** of what the out-group will do and **Envy/Enmity** toward their perceived illegitimate power and malicious intent. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez states, "They aren’t working for these billions. They’re stealing them. They’re stealing them. They’re stealing them from you and you and me" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This rhetoric is highly effective at mobilization through antagonism. Within this archetype, we see two sub-variants:
*   **Left-Populist (Sanders/AOC):** The out-group is economic ("oligarchs"). The appeal to in-group solidarity is based on class. As Ocasio-Cortez says, the goal is "class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).
*   **Right-Populist (King):** The out-group is cultural and national ("illegal criminal alien," "lame duck President," activist judges). The appeal to in-group solidarity is based on national identity and constitutional originalism.

**Archetype 2: The Unifying Institutionalist (McCain)**
This archetype appears as a statistical outlier in this dataset, defined by its high positive cohesion score. It is characterized by the near-total absence of fragmenting rhetoric and high scores on **Amity**, **Compersion**, and **Individual Dignity**. The core strategy is to transcend political division by appealing to a superordinate identity ("we are fellow Americans") and to model democratic norms. The high **Compersion** score is key. As John McCain stated about his victorious opponent, "his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance... I deeply admire and commend him for achieving" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). This language is the rhetorical opposite of the populist "stealing" narrative. It frames an opponent's success as legitimate and even admirable, a foundational act for post-conflict reconciliation.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CFF proved highly effective in this analysis. Its primary strengths are its discriminatory power and the insightfulness of its derived metrics.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully differentiated between texts with starkly different rhetorical aims. The `full_cohesion_index` clearly separated the unifying speech of McCain from the fragmenting speeches of the other three speakers. This demonstrates that the framework's dimensions are sensitive enough to capture the vast differences between political communication styles.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF's oppositional structure was an excellent fit for this corpus of polarized political speech. The strong negative correlations between opposing pairs validate the framework's core theoretical assumptions. The language used by the speakers aligns almost perfectly with the dimensional definitions.
*   **Methodological Insights:** The analysis demonstrates that moving beyond simple sentiment analysis is critical. A basic sentiment tool might score both McCain's and Sanders' speeches as "positive" because they both contain language of hope. However, the CFF's `full_cohesion_index` correctly identifies that the overall *function* of Sanders' rhetoric is fragmentive, while McCain's is cohesive. The **Tension Indices** provided a valuable, if negative, finding: the rhetoric in this corpus is not complex or contradictory but simple and polarized.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications

The findings from this analysis have significant theoretical implications. The identification of a "fragmentative syndrome"—a tight, almost unbreakable correlation between Tribal Dominance, Fear, Enmity, and Fragmentative Goals—suggests that this form of political rhetoric is not an ad-hoc collection of appeals but a coherent and structured ideological system. This provides quantitative support for theories of populism that describe it as a "thin-centered ideology" (Mudde, 2004) that attaches itself to other ideological content (left-wing economics or right-wing nationalism). The CFF provides the tools to measure the "thin" populist core and the "thick" ideological content it merges with.

Furthermore, the stark contrast between the Populist and Institutionalist archetypes highlights the erosion of what were once considered stable democratic norms, such as the gracious concession speech. McCain's speech, with its high **Compersion** and **Amity**, serves as a baseline for a form of discourse centered on preserving the legitimacy of the democratic process itself. The other texts, which lack these qualities, represent a shift towards a politics where delegitimizing opponents is the primary strategic goal. As Bernie Sanders stated, "These guys have no sense of what goes on in the real world. They live in another planet" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This is not a disagreement over policy; it is a fundamental challenge to the opponent's legitimacy and connection to reality.

### Limitations and Future Directions

The primary limitation of this report is its **extremely small sample size (N=4)**. The statistical patterns identified, while powerful within this corpus, cannot be considered generalizable. They serve as a proof-of-concept for the CFF's analytical power and generate hypotheses for future research, but they are not definitive conclusions about American political discourse at large.

This analysis opens several avenues for future research:
1.  **Large-Scale Analysis:** The most critical next step is to apply the CFF to a large, longitudinal corpus of political texts (e.g., all congressional speeches over a 20-year period) to determine if the identified archetypes are stable and if the trend is moving away from the Institutionalist model and towards the Populist one.
2.  **Media Analysis:** The CFF could be used to analyze news media coverage (e.g., cable news transcripts, newspaper articles) to measure how these rhetorical strategies are amplified, filtered, or challenged in the broader information ecosystem.
3.  **Experimental Research:** The archetypes identified here could be used as stimuli in survey experiments to test their causal effects on citizen attitudes, such as political trust, affective polarization, and support for democratic norms.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though limited in scope, demonstrates the profound capabilities of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) to move beyond surface-level content analysis and reveal the deep rhetorical structures that shape political discourse. The study successfully identified a prevailing trend towards fragmentative communication within the corpus, characterized by a potent synergy of fear, enmity, and tribalism. It distinguished between two fundamentally different models of political speech—a "Fragmenting Populist" and a "Unifying Institutionalist"—providing a quantitative basis for understanding the competing rhetorical logics at play in contemporary politics.

Methodologically, the analysis served as a strong validation of the CFF's design. The framework's oppositional dimensions showed high construct validity, and its derived indices provided nuanced, actionable insights into the overall function and complexity of the analyzed texts. By integrating quantitative rigor with qualitative textual evidence, this report showcases a powerful approach to understanding how language is used to build or break the bonds of social cohesion. The hypotheses and archetypes generated here provide a robust foundation for future large-scale research into the health of our public discourse.
