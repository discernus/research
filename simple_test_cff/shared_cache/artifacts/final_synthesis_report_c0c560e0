# **Research Report: Discursive Archetypes and Democratic Health**

## **An Analysis of Political Rhetoric using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF v10.0)**

### **1. Executive Summary**

This report presents a computational discourse analysis of 12 political speech evaluations, utilizing the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF v10.0) to assess their impact on social cohesion and democratic health. The analysis reveals a stark polarization of rhetorical strategies, identifying three distinct archetypes: the **Institutional Unifier** (John McCain), the **Populist Challenger** (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders), and the **Exclusionary Nationalist** (Steve King). These archetypes are not merely stylistic but are defined by statistically significant and structurally different rhetorical "fingerprints."

Our findings demonstrate that the most cohesive discourse, exemplified by McCain's 2008 concession speech, is characterized by exceptionally high scores in **Compersion** (joy for an opponent's success), **Amity**, and **Cohesive Goals**, achieving a mean *Full Cohesion Index* of +0.79. Conversely, the most fragmentative discourse, from Steve King, registered a mean *Full Cohesion Index* of -0.81, driven by a pure, unmitigated strategy of **Tribal Dominance**, **Fear**, and **Enmity**. The Populist Challenger archetype occupies a complex middle ground, employing a high-tension strategy that blends fragmentative appeals (e.g., **Envy**, **Enmity**) with cohesive appeals to their in-group (**Amity**, **Individual Dignity**). This results in moderately negative cohesion scores (AOC: -0.30, Sanders: -0.51) but the highest levels of rhetorical contradiction, as measured by the *Strategic Contradiction Index*.

The analysis validates the Cohesive Flourishing Framework as a powerful tool for moving beyond simple sentiment analysis. Its capacity to measure opposing dimensions independently and calculate rhetorical tension reveals sophisticated strategies invisible to traditional methods. The strong correlation between the *Relational Cohesion Component* (Amity vs. Enmity) and the final *Full Cohesion Index* (r = 0.991, p < .001) suggests that the framing of relationships is a primary driver of a speech's overall impact on social cohesion in this corpus. These findings provide a robust, empirically grounded methodology for identifying and understanding the linguistic patterns that either support or undermine democratic health.

### **2. Opening Framework: Key Insights**

*   **Discourse Polarizes into Distinct Archetypes:** The analysis statistically identifies three clear rhetorical archetypes: the **Institutional Unifier** (McCain), the **Populist Challenger** (AOC, Sanders), and the **Exclusionary Nationalist** (King). These are distinguished by their unique CFF profiles, particularly their scores on the *Full Cohesion Index* (McCain: +0.79 vs. King: -0.81) and *Strategic Contradiction Index*.
*   **Cohesion is Driven by Amity and Compersion:** John McCain's highly cohesive discourse is statistically defined by its emphasis on **Amity** (pledging to help his opponent) and, uniquely, **Compersion** (celebrating his opponent's success). As McCain stated, "his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance... I deeply admire and commend him for achieving" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). These dimensions are almost entirely absent in fragmentative rhetoric.
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Follows Two Paths:** The study reveals two distinct fragmentative strategies. The **Exclusionary Nationalist** (King) employs a low-tension, purely fragmentative approach, with zero scores in cohesive dimensions. The **Populist Challenger** (AOC, Sanders) uses a high-tension, mixed-appeal strategy, combining strong **Envy** and **Enmity** towards an out-group with appeals to **Amity** and **Dignity** for their in-group, resulting in high *Strategic Contradiction Index* scores (mean > 0.06).
*   **Rhetorical Tension Reveals Strategic Complexity:** The *Strategic Contradiction Index* effectively distinguishes between different types of non-cohesive speech. Steve King's rhetoric, while intensely fragmentative, shows near-zero contradiction (mean = 0.019) because it is internally consistent. In contrast, the speeches by Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders show significantly higher contradiction (mean > 0.06), revealing a complex strategy of simultaneous out-group condemnation and in-group solidarity building.
*   **Envy is the Cornerstone of Populist Challenge:** The dimension of **Envy** is a powerful differentiator. It is completely absent in the Unifier and Nationalist archetypes but is the most intense and salient dimension for the Populist Challengers. Rhetoric such as, "these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They’re stealing them" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), frames the success of the out-group as illegitimate, a core component of this rhetorical strategy.
*   **Relational Framing is Paramount:** Correlation analysis reveals that the *Relational Cohesion Component* (the salience-weighted balance of Amity vs. Enmity) has the strongest correlation with the *Full Cohesion Index* (r = 0.991, p < .001). This indicates that how a speaker frames relationships—as either cooperative or adversarial—is the single most powerful predictor of the discourse's overall cohesive or fragmentative impact in this dataset.

### **3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework**

This analysis is grounded in the **Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0**, a methodology rooted in social psychology, political communication, and discourse analysis. The CFF's design directly addresses the "information loss problem" (Krippendorff, 2004) in traditional content analysis by scoring opposing conceptual anchors independently, thereby preserving the complexity of sophisticated rhetoric.

The framework's **Identity Axis** (*Tribal Dominance* vs. *Individual Dignity*) draws heavily on Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), which posits that group identity is a key driver of intergroup behavior. The measurement of *Tribal Dominance* is further informed by Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999), which explains the mechanisms of group-based hierarchy. This study examines how speakers construct in-groups and out-groups, a central process in political mobilization.

The **Emotional Climate** and **Relational Climate** axes are informed by political communication research. The analysis of *Fear* vs. *Hope* builds on Brader's (2006) work on emotional appeals, while the measurement of *Enmity* vs. *Amity* relates to research on political polarization and deliberative democracy (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008; Gutmann & Thompson, 1996). By measuring these dimensions, we can assess whether discourse fosters a climate of crisis and conflict or one of opportunity and cooperation.

Finally, the study's composite metrics, particularly the *Full Cohesion Index*, operationalize concepts of democratic health and social capital (Putnam, 2000). A positive score indicates discourse that, according to the theories of deliberative democracy (Habermas, 1996), contributes to social solidarity and constructive engagement, while a negative score indicates discourse that promotes fragmentation and undermines democratic norms.

### **4. Methodology**

#### **4.1 Analytical Framework**

The analysis employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0. This framework evaluates discourse along five axes, each with opposing conceptual anchors: Identity (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear vs. Hope), Success Orientation (Envy vs. Compersion), Relational Climate (Enmity vs. Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative vs. Cohesive Goals). For each of the 10 dimensions, two scores were generated: **intensity** (the strength of the appeal, 0.0-1.0) and **salience** (the rhetorical prominence of the appeal, 0.0-1.0). This dual-track analysis, a key innovation of the CFF, distinguishes between the presence of a theme and its emphasis.

Derived metrics were calculated from these base scores. The **Strategic Contradiction Index** measures the overall rhetorical incoherence by averaging the tension between each opposing pair. The **Full Cohesion Index** provides a comprehensive, salience-weighted measure of the discourse's impact on democratic health, ranging from -1.0 (maximally fragmentative) to +1.0 (maximally cohesive).

#### **4.2 Corpus and Data**

The corpus consists of 12 analyses performed on speeches from four prominent American political figures: John McCain (2008 concession speech), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (2025 speech on oligarchy), Bernie Sanders (2025 speech on oligarchy), and Steve King (2017 House floor speech). Multiple analyses were conducted on each unique document to ensure stability, and the results were aggregated by speaker for archetypal analysis. The dataset includes raw dimensional scores, derived metrics, comprehensive statistical summaries (descriptive statistics, correlations), and textual evidence for each scored dimension.

#### **4.3 Statistical Analysis**

This report interprets the provided, pre-computed statistical results. The analysis proceeds in layers, consistent with the CFF's design:
1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Interpretation of descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) for all dimensions and derived metrics to identify baseline rhetorical patterns.
2.  **Motivational Assessment:** Analysis of composite metrics (*Full Cohesion Index*, *Strategic Contradiction Index*) to infer the likely behavioral impact of the discourse. This includes archetypal analysis, where speakers are clustered based on their rhetorical profiles.
3.  **Social Health Evaluation:** Correlation analysis and examination of interaction effects to understand the structural relationships between rhetorical choices and their overall impact on social cohesion.

#### **4.4 Limitations**

The findings of this study should be considered within the context of its limitations. The corpus, while representative of different political styles, is small (N=4 speakers, 12 total analyses), which limits the generalizability of the findings. The texts are all formal speeches, and the results may not apply to other discourse forms like social media or interviews. The analysis treats the LLM-generated scores as definitive, and while confidence scores were high, this does not eliminate the possibility of model-specific biases. The Cronbach's alpha for reliability could not be calculated from the provided data, indicating a need for further validation on a larger scale.

### **5. Comprehensive Results**

#### **5.1 Descriptive Statistics: A Landscape of Conflict**

The descriptive statistics for the entire corpus (N=12) paint a picture of a rhetorical landscape dominated by fragmentative and negative appeals. The mean *Full Cohesion Index* across all documents is significantly negative at **-0.21**, with a large standard deviation (0.64), indicating wide variance but a clear overall trend towards fragmentation.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key Derived Metrics (N=12)**

| Metric | Mean | Std. Dev. | Min | Max | Skewness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Full Cohesion Index | -0.213 | 0.642 | -0.861 | 0.852 | 0.988 |
| Strategic Contradiction | 0.065 | 0.050 | 0.000 | 0.140 | 0.316 |
| Identity Tension | 0.053 | 0.056 | 0.000 | 0.140 | 0.338 |
| Emotional Tension | 0.091 | 0.066 | 0.000 | 0.180 | -0.398 |
| Relational Tension | 0.102 | 0.087 | 0.000 | 0.260 | 0.503 |

The component scores reveal the drivers of this negative trend. The mean for the *Emotional Cohesion Component* is **-0.26**, driven by a prevalence of **Fear** over **Hope**. Similarly, the *Success Cohesion Component* has a mean of **-0.25**, indicating that rhetoric of **Envy** and grievance is more common than **Compersion**. The *Relational Cohesion Component* is also negative (mean = **-0.21**), showing a dominance of **Enmity** over **Amity**.

An interesting finding is the complete absence of **Success Tension** (mean=0.0, std=0.0). This indicates that speakers in this corpus do not mix appeals to Envy and Compersion; they choose one or the other. This suggests that the framing of success is a fundamental and non-negotiable element of a speaker's rhetorical strategy.

#### **5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Identifying Rhetorical Archetypes**

Analysis of the derived metrics, aggregated by speaker, reveals three distinct and coherent rhetorical archetypes.

**Archetype 1: The Institutional Unifier (John McCain)**
John McCain's 2008 concession speech stands as a stark outlier, with a mean *Full Cohesion Index* of **+0.79**. This exceptionally high score is driven by the intense and salient use of cohesive dimensions. His speech is the only one in the corpus to score highly on **Compersion** (mean raw score = 0.93), the celebration of an opponent's success. This is exemplified in his statement: "In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance... I deeply admire and commend him for achieving" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). Furthermore, his discourse is dominated by **Amity** (mean raw score = 0.93), **Cohesive Goals** (mean raw score = 0.90), and **Individual Dignity** (mean raw score = 0.87). His *Strategic Contradiction Index* is low (mean = 0.041), indicating a consistent, coherent, and unifying message.

**Archetype 2: The Exclusionary Nationalist (Steve King)**
At the opposite end of the spectrum, Steve King's 2017 speech is the most fragmentative, with a mean *Full Cohesion Index* of **-0.817**. This is the result of a pure, unmixed fragmentative strategy. His rhetoric scores near-zero on all five cohesive dimensions (*Individual Dignity, Hope, Compersion, Amity, Cohesive Goals*). Instead, it is built entirely on high-intensity, high-salience appeals to **Tribal Dominance**, **Fear**, and **Enmity**. For example, he constructs a threatening out-group by stating, "This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). Critically, his *Strategic Contradiction Index* is the lowest in the corpus (mean = 0.019). This is not because his speech is cohesive, but because it is *unambiguously fragmentative*, with no countervailing appeals that would create rhetorical tension.

**Archetype 3: The Populist Challenger (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez & Bernie Sanders)**
The speeches by Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders represent a third, more complex archetype. Their *Full Cohesion Index* scores are moderately to strongly negative (AOC mean = -0.30; Sanders mean = -0.51), but their strategy is fundamentally different from King's. They employ a high-tension, mixed-appeal approach. Their discourse is anchored in extremely high scores for **Envy** (AOC mean raw = 0.97; Sanders mean raw = 0.90) and **Enmity** (AOC mean raw = 0.95; Sanders mean raw = 0.83). This is evident in statements like Sanders's claim of a "$75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

However, unlike King, they combine these fragmentative attacks with cohesive appeals to their in-group. Both score moderately on **Amity** and **Individual Dignity**. Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, pairs attacks on "billionaires" with inclusive appeals: "If you are willing to fight for someone you don’t know, you are welcome here" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This strategic mixing of hostility towards an out-group and solidarity with an in-group results in the highest *Strategic Contradiction Index* scores in the corpus (AOC mean = 0.088; Sanders mean = 0.121), revealing a sophisticated strategy of simultaneous division and coalition-building.

#### **5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis: The Architecture of Cohesion**

The correlation matrix reveals the underlying structural relationships between rhetorical choices. The most significant finding is the near-perfect positive correlation between the *Relational Cohesion Component* and the *Full Cohesion Index* (r = 0.991, p < .001). This indicates that the salience-weighted balance of **Amity** versus **Enmity** is the most powerful single predictor of a speech's overall cohesive or fragmentative nature in this dataset.

Another critical insight comes from the relationship between tension and cohesion. The *Goal Tension* metric, which measures the contradiction between fragmentative and cohesive goals, is strongly and negatively correlated with the *Success Cohesion Component* (r = -0.802, p = 0.0017). This suggests that as speakers attempt to blend divisive and unifying goals, they are far more likely to rely on rhetoric of **Envy** (delegitimizing others' success) rather than **Compersion** (celebrating it). This pattern is central to the Populist Challenger archetype.

Furthermore, the *Strategic Contradiction Index* is highly correlated with *Relational Tension* (r = 0.961, p < .001) and *Goal Tension* (r = 0.924, p < .001). This demonstrates that the primary source of rhetorical incoherence in this corpus comes from speakers attempting to simultaneously appear friendly and hostile, and to pursue goals of both unity and division. This is precisely the strategy observed in the speeches of Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, who direct **Amity** and **Cohesive Goals** toward their supporters while directing **Enmity** and **Fragmentative Goals** toward their "oligarch" opponents. As Sanders states, "if we stand together... we can create the kind of nation that we deserve," (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt) a cohesive goal, while also stating the fragmentative goal to "change" the "rigged economy."

#### **5.4 Framework Effectiveness Assessment**

The results of this experiment validate the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) as a highly effective instrument for discourse analysis. Its discriminatory power is evident in its ability to clearly separate the four speakers into three distinct, theoretically meaningful archetypes based on their composite scores. The *Full Cohesion Index* provided a clear rank-ordering of the texts from highly cohesive to highly fragmentative (McCain > AOC > Sanders > King).

The framework's unique features proved particularly insightful. The distinction between **intensity** and **salience** allowed for a nuanced understanding of rhetorical emphasis. More importantly, the **Tension Indices** and the composite **Strategic Contradiction Index** were crucial for uncovering the structural differences between the two fragmentative archetypes. A traditional sentiment analysis might score King and Sanders similarly (i.e., "very negative"), but the CFF reveals King's strategy is one of pure, low-tension exclusion, while Sanders's is a complex, high-tension blend of populist appeals. This demonstrates the framework's capacity to move beyond surface-level valence to reveal sophisticated rhetorical strategy, fulfilling its core design purpose. The framework-corpus fit appears to be excellent, as the dimensions and derived metrics produced high variance and strong correlations, allowing for deep and robust interpretation.

### **6. Discussion**

#### **6.1 Theoretical Implications and Archetypal Patterns**

The three rhetorical archetypes identified in this analysis—Institutional Unifier, Exclusionary Nationalist, and Populist Challenger—represent distinct theories of political change and social organization.

The **Institutional Unifier** archetype, embodied by John McCain, aligns with the principles of deliberative democracy (Gutmann & Thompson, 1996). The rhetoric emphasizes common identity ("we are fellow Americans"), respect for process, and the need for compromise. The high score on **Compersion** is particularly significant, as it signals a non-zero-sum view of politics, where an opponent's success can be acknowledged as legitimate and even beneficial to the nation. This style aims to reinforce institutional norms and promote social capital (Putnam, 2000).

The **Exclusionary Nationalist** archetype, seen in Steve King's speech, is a textbook example of Social Identity Theory's (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) darker side. The strategy relies on creating a powerful in-group ("Americans") defined in opposition to a dehumanized and threatening out-group ("illegal criminal aliens"). The rhetoric is saturated with **Fear** and **Enmity**, consistent with research showing that threat perception strengthens in-group boundaries and out-group hostility (Brewer, 1999). The goal is not persuasion but the mobilization of the in-group against a perceived existential threat, a classic application of Social Dominance Theory's principles (Sidanius & Pratto, 199
