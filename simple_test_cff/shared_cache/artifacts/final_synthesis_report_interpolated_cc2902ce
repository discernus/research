## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of a small corpus (N=4) of political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis reveals a starkly polarized rhetorical landscape within the sample, characterized by two dominant and opposing linguistic strategies. One strategy, exemplified by John McCain's 2008 concession speech, leverages cohesive dimensions such as **Hope**, **Amity**, and **Individual Dignity** to build broad-based appeals. The opposing strategy, seen in a speech by Steve King, relies on fragmentative dimensions like **Fear**, **Enmity**, and **Tribal Dominance** to consolidate an in-group identity against a perceived out-group. The framework's derived metrics successfully quantified this divide, with the **Full Cohesion Index** clearly separating the documents along this spectrum (McCain: +0.84 vs. King: -0.74).

The analysis further validates the CFF's internal construct validity through a correlation matrix, which demonstrates strong, statistically consistent relationships. Cohesive dimensions are positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with their fragmentative counterparts. For instance, the salience of **Compersion** (celebrating others' success) and **Tribal Dominance** are perfectly negatively correlated (r = -1.00), indicating they represent mutually exclusive rhetorical choices in this dataset. Furthermore, the **Strategic Contradiction Index** proved effective in identifying texts with more complex or mixed messaging, such as a speech by Bernie Sanders, which scored highest on this metric (0.102).

While these findings are highly suggestive, the extremely small sample size (N=4) is a significant limitation. The results should be considered preliminary and illustrative of the framework's potential rather than generalizable conclusions about political discourse. The analysis demonstrates the CFF's capacity to move beyond simple sentiment analysis and capture nuanced, often contradictory, rhetorical strategies. Future research should apply this methodology to a larger and more diverse corpus to validate these initial patterns and explore the dynamics of cohesive and fragmentative language in greater detail.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This pilot analysis yielded several key insights into the rhetorical patterns within the corpus and the effectiveness of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **Extreme Rhetorical Polarization:** The corpus is defined by a profound rhetorical divide. Documents cluster at opposite ends of the cohesion spectrum, with the McCain speech registering a **Full Cohesion Index** of +0.84, while the Steve King speech scored -0.74. This demonstrates the framework's high discriminatory power in identifying fundamentally different communicative aims.
*   **Identification of Opposing Rhetorical "Playbooks":** Correlation analysis reveals two distinct and internally consistent rhetorical strategies. A "Fragmentative" strategy strongly links appeals to **Fear**, **Enmity**, and **Tribal Dominance** (e.g., `fear_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw` correlation, r = +0.996). A "Cohesive" strategy links **Hope**, **Amity**, **Individual Dignity**, and **Cohesive Goals** (e.g., `amity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw` correlation, r = +0.999).
*   **Validation of Framework's Oppositional Design:** The CFF's structure, which pairs opposing concepts (e.g., Hope vs. Fear), is strongly supported by the data. Across the board, paired dimensions exhibit strong negative correlations. The perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) between the salience of **Compersion** and **Tribal Dominance** serves as a powerful indicator of the framework's construct validity within this sample.
*   **Utility of the Strategic Contradiction Index:** The derived **Strategic Contradiction Index** successfully quantifies rhetorical complexity. A speech by Bernie Sanders, which blended high-intensity fragmentative language (e.g., `tribal_dominance_raw` = 0.80) with cohesive goals, registered the highest contradiction score (0.102), distinguishing it from the more straightforwardly cohesive (McCain, 0.014) or fragmentative (King, 0.044) texts.
*   **Fragmentative Language Can Co-opt Cohesive Themes:** The analysis reveals how speakers can employ language associated with cohesive values to serve fragmentative ends. For example, a speech by Steve King, which was overwhelmingly fragmentative, still contained appeals to universal rights, as seen in the statement, "That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This highlights the CFF's ability to detect nuanced and potentially manipulative rhetorical tactics.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis utilizes the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed to analyze political and social discourse. The CFF moves beyond simplistic positive/negative sentiment analysis by measuring the intensity and salience of ten distinct rhetorical dimensions, organized into five oppositional pairs:
*   **Identity:** Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance
*   **Emotion:** Hope vs. Fear
*   **Success:** Compersion vs. Envy
*   **Relation:** Amity vs. Enmity
*   **Goals:** Cohesive Goals vs. Fragmentative Goals

By scoring these dimensions independently, the CFF captures the complexity of sophisticated communication where competing appeals may be used simultaneously. From these base scores, the framework calculates several derived metrics, including:
*   **Tension Indices:** Measure the degree of conflict between opposing dimensions within a single text.
*   **Strategic Contradiction Index:** The mean of the five tension indices, providing a single score for a document's overall rhetorical incoherence or complexity.
*   **Cohesion Indices (Descriptive, Motivational, Full):** Salience-weighted composite scores that measure a document's overall orientation toward social cohesion or fragmentation. The **Full Cohesion Index** is the most comprehensive, incorporating all ten dimensions.

### Data and Corpus
The research data consists of a small pilot corpus of four political texts. The documents were processed to generate raw intensity scores (0-1 scale) and salience scores (0-1 scale) for each of the ten CFF dimensions. The statistical analysis was performed on this dataset, which included the base scores and the derived metrics calculated by the `calculate_derived_metrics` function.

### Analytical Approach and Limitations
The analysis is primarily descriptive and exploratory due to the extremely small sample size (N=4). All findings must be interpreted with caution and are not generalizable. The primary goal is to assess the CFF's analytical capabilities and identify preliminary patterns that warrant further investigation with a larger corpus. Statistical methods employed include descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and Pearson correlation analysis to explore relationships between dimensions.

A key limitation of this analysis is the inability to perform speaker-level aggregation. The `analyze_rhetorical_profiles_by_speaker` function was skipped because the required `corpus_manifest.json` file, which maps documents to speakers, was not available. Therefore, all analysis is conducted at the document level. Furthermore, while the provided textual evidence is used to ground statistical findings, its sparseness means not every numerical pattern has a direct, illustrative quote.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics: A Corpus of Extremes

An examination of the descriptive statistics for the corpus reveals a landscape of rhetorical extremes. The standard deviations for nearly all raw and salience scores are very high relative to their means, indicating significant variance and a lack of a central tendency. This suggests the four documents are not clustered around a common rhetorical style but instead occupy distinct, often opposing, positions.

For example, the mean score for **Tribal Dominance** (0.56) is nearly identical to that for **Individual Dignity** (0.48), but the high standard deviations (0.39 and 0.38, respectively) show that documents tend to score high on one and low on the other, rather than moderately on both. This pattern holds across all five oppositional pairs.

The derived metrics confirm this polarization. The **Full Cohesion Index** has a mean close to zero (-0.11) but a large standard deviation (0.67), with scores ranging from a highly cohesive +0.84 to a highly fragmentative -0.74. This confirms the corpus is split between cohesive and fragmentative messaging. The **Strategic Contradiction Index** is relatively low on average (0.049), suggesting that most documents, despite their opposition, are rhetorically consistent.

| Full Cohesion Index             | -0.110| 0.674     | -0.735 | 0.840  |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Quantifying Cohesion and Contradiction

The CFF's derived indices provide a powerful lens for interpreting the overall strategic intent of each document. The **Full Cohesion Index** acts as a primary measure of a text's orientation, effectively mapping the documents onto a single spectrum from fragmentative to cohesive.

*   **John McCain (Concession Speech):** Full Cohesion Index = **+0.840**. This score indicates a powerfully cohesive message, driven by high scores in Hope, Amity, Compersion, and Individual Dignity, and negligible scores in their fragmentative counterparts.
*   **Steve King (House Floor Speech):** Full Cohesion Index = **-0.735**. This score represents a strongly fragmentative message, dominated by high scores in Fear, Enmity, Tribal Dominance, and Fragmentative Goals. The negative value reflects the overwhelming weight of fragmentative rhetoric.
*   **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez & Bernie Sanders (Fighting Oligarchy Speeches):** Full Cohesion Indices = **-0.175** and **-0.370**, respectively. These scores place them on the fragmentative side of the spectrum, but far more moderately than the King speech. Their rhetoric is characterized by a mix of high-intensity fragmentative appeals (e.g., Tribal Dominance, Enmity) and cohesive appeals (e.g., Individual Dignity, Cohesive Goals).

The **Strategic Contradiction Index** further illuminates the complexity of these mixed messages. While the McCain (0.014) and King (0.044) speeches are relatively straightforward, the Sanders speech scores highest on this index (0.102). This is because it combines very high scores on opposing dimensions (e.g., `tribal_dominance_raw` = 0.80 and `cohesive_goals_raw` = 0.60), creating significant rhetorical tension. This metric successfully flags the Sanders text as one that attempts to blend seemingly contradictory appeals—a classic populist strategy of defining a "virtuous people" (a cohesive in-group goal) against a corrupt elite (a fragmentative, enmity-driven target).

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis: Mapping Rhetorical Strategies

The correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies within the corpus. The results show two powerful, internally consistent, and mutually antagonistic clusters of dimensions. This finding is a cornerstone of the analysis, suggesting that speakers in this dataset draw from one of two distinct rhetorical "playbooks."

**The Fragmentative Cluster:** This strategy is characterized by strong positive correlations between dimensions that define an in-group by targeting an out-group.
*   **`tribal_dominance_raw`** and **`fear_raw`** are almost perfectly correlated (r = +0.996).
*   **`enmity_raw`** and **`tribal_dominance_raw`** are also very strongly correlated (r = +0.965).
*   **`fragmentative_goals_raw`** is tightly linked to this cluster, correlating strongly with `tribal_dominance_raw` (r = +0.987).

This suggests a unified rhetorical strategy where appeals to group identity (`tribal_dominance`) are constructed through fear-based narratives (`fear`) directed at a specific enemy (`enmity`) to achieve a divisive goal (`fragmentative_goals`). This is exemplified in the Steve King speech, which scores high on all these dimensions and contains statements like, "And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment," which frames a political process as a destructive, fragmentative outcome (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

**The Cohesive Cluster:** This strategy is characterized by strong positive correlations between dimensions that foster unity and shared purpose.
*   **`amity_raw`** and **`cohesive_goals_raw`** are nearly perfectly correlated (r = +0.999).
*   **`individual_dignity_raw`** is strongly correlated with **`amity_raw`** (r = +0.849) and **`cohesive_goals_raw`** (r = +0.868).
*   **`hope_raw`** shows a moderate positive correlation with this cluster.

This indicates a strategy where appeals to friendship and goodwill (`amity`) are used to advance shared objectives (`cohesive_goals`), grounded in a respect for universal human worth (`individual_dignity`). This approach is evident in the speech by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which, despite other fragmentative elements, includes clear cohesive goal-setting: "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `tribal_dominance_raw`      | `fear_raw`                  | +0.996      | Fragmentative cluster synergy                |
| `amity_raw`                 | `cohesive_goals_raw`        | +0.999      | Cohesive cluster synergy                     |

| `individual_dignity_raw`    | `tribal_dominance_raw`      | -0.778      | Strong opposition between identity dimensions|
| `hope_raw`                  | `fear_raw`                  | -0.571      | Moderate opposition between emotion dimensions|

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights: Validating the Framework

The correlation patterns provide strong evidence for the CFF's construct validity. The framework is designed around oppositional pairs, and the data consistently bears this out. The most striking example is the perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) between the salience of **Compersion** and **Tribal Dominance**. This indicates that, in this corpus, an emphasis on celebrating the success of others is rhetorically antithetical to an emphasis on in-group superiority. They are mutually exclusive strategies. Similarly, **Individual Dignity** is strongly negatively correlated with **Tribal Dominance** (r = -0.778), confirming their oppositional nature on the Identity axis.

These statistical patterns reveal how abstract dimensions manifest in practice. The tight bond in the fragmentative cluster shows how fear is a primary vehicle for activating tribal identity and enmity. The cohesive cluster shows how appeals to amity and shared goals are often grounded in the language of universal dignity. For instance, a speaker can invoke a cohesive value like constitutional order, as Steve King does by stating, "We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), even within a speech that is otherwise highly fragmentative. The CFF's ability to score these dimensions independently is crucial for capturing such complex rhetorical maneuvers, where a universally valued concept (the Constitution) can be framed as a tool for in-group preservation against an out-group threat.

The analysis highlights the practical significance of these correlations. A political communicator aiming for a fragmentative impact would, based on this data, be well-advised to combine fear-based messaging with strong in-group/out-group framing. Conversely, a communicator seeking cohesion would benefit from linking hopeful visions to shared goals and universal dignity. The framework effectively decodes these underlying strategic logics.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness in several key areas:

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, particularly the **Full Cohesion Index**, shows excellent discriminatory power. It clearly and quantitatively separates documents with different rhetorical aims, mapping them onto a meaningful spectrum of cohesion and fragmentation.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF appears to be an excellent fit for analyzing polarized political discourse. Its dimensional structure aligns well with the observed rhetorical strategies, and the strong correlations and anti-correlations suggest its theoretical constructs are robust, at least within this context.
*   **Insight Generation:** The derived metrics, especially the **Strategic Contradiction Index**, provide insights that are not available from simple sentiment or topic analysis. This metric's ability to flag the Sanders speech as uniquely complex is a testament to the framework's nuanced approach.

The primary limitation remains the sample size. While the patterns are remarkably clear and statistically strong, they are based on only four data points. The framework's effectiveness must be further tested on a larger, more varied corpus that includes less polarized or more ambiguous texts.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this preliminary analysis, while not generalizable, offer significant theoretical and methodological implications. The clear emergence of two opposing rhetorical archetypes—a "Cohesive Unifier" and a "Fragmenting Warrior"—suggests that political discourse, at least in its more polarized forms, may operate according to identifiable and internally consistent logics. The McCain speech serves as a near-perfect exemplar of the unifier archetype, using hope, amity, and dignity to bridge divides. The King speech is an equally clear exemplar of the warrior archetype, using fear, enmity, and tribalism to harden divides. The other two texts represent hybrid strategies, suggesting that most political rhetoric may exist on a continuum between these two poles, employing elements of both.

The strong validation of the CFF's oppositional structure is a key methodological takeaway. The consistent negative correlations between paired dimensions (Hope/Fear, Amity/Enmity, etc.) indicate that the framework accurately captures the trade-offs inherent in rhetorical choices. This suggests that the CFF is not merely a list of categories but a structured system that reflects real-world communicative constraints.

The most significant limitation of this study is the sample size (N=4), which prevents any inferential claims. The clarity of the patterns may be an artifact of the small, highly polarized selection of texts. A larger study is needed to determine if these "Cohesive" and "Fragmentative" clusters hold across a wider range of speakers, contexts, and time periods. Future research should prioritize applying the CFF to a large-N corpus to test the hypotheses generated here. For example, one could test whether the **Strategic Contradiction Index** is systematically higher in populist rhetoric compared to establishment rhetoric. Another avenue would be to conduct a temporal analysis to see if political discourse is, on average, moving toward one end of the cohesion spectrum over time.

Finally, the inability to conduct speaker-level analysis highlights the critical importance of robust metadata. Future data collection efforts should ensure that a `corpus_manifest.json` or similar file is available to link texts to speakers, parties, and other relevant variables, which would enable more powerful group-level comparisons.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, despite its limited scope, successfully demonstrates the analytical potential of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.1. By moving beyond simple sentiment analysis, the CFF provides a multi-dimensional and nuanced assessment of political language, revealing the underlying strategies that aim to either unify or divide. The study identified two starkly opposed rhetorical archetypes within the pilot corpus and validated the framework's internal structure through strong correlational patterns. The derived metrics, particularly the **Full Cohesion Index** and the **Strategic Contradiction Index**, proved to be powerful tools for quantifying a document's overall rhetorical orientation and complexity.

The findings, while preliminary, are highly suggestive and provide a strong foundation for future research. They underscore the value of computational methods that preserve, rather than discard, the complex and often contradictory nature of human communication. By applying this framework to larger and more diverse datasets, researchers can further investigate the dynamics of social cohesion and fragmentation, generating testable hypotheses about the role of language in shaping democratic health. This pilot study serves as a compelling proof-of-concept for a new and promising direction in the computational analysis of discourse.
