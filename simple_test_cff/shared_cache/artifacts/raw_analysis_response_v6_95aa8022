    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with two distinct but thematically linked sections. The first section critiques judicial appointments, and the second, much longer section, discusses crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The analysis weights the second section more heavily due to its length and intense rhetorical focus. The speaker's rhetoric is consistently adversarial and relies heavily on fear-based appeals through graphic narratives, making the scoring for several dimensions straightforward and high-confidence."
