## 1. Executive Summary

This report details a computational analysis of a small corpus of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis sought to evaluate the framework's utility in dissecting rhetorical strategies and their potential impact on social cohesion. Due to the pilot nature of this study (N=4), all findings should be considered preliminary and illustrative of the analytical method rather than generalizable conclusions.

The analysis reveals two distinct and opposing rhetorical meta-strategies or "syndromes" within the corpus. A **Fragmentative Syndrome** was identified through strong positive correlations between dimensions of `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, and `envy` (e.g., `fear_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw`, r = +0.996). This suggests a rhetorical approach that systematically links in-group identity with threat narratives and hostility toward out-groups. Conversely, a **Cohesive Syndrome** emerged from strong positive correlations between `individual_dignity`, `amity`, `compersion`, and `cohesive_goals` (e.g., `individual_dignity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw`, r = +0.87), indicating a strategy that aligns universal dignity with pro-social relations and shared objectives. The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions (e.g., `compersion_raw` vs. `envy_raw`, r = -0.98) provide initial construct validity for the CFF's oppositional design.

The framework's derived metrics proved effective in capturing higher-order patterns. The `full_cohesion_index` demonstrated significant discriminatory power, with scores ranging from highly cohesive (+0.84) to highly fragmentative (-0.74), clearly differentiating the documents' overall rhetorical posture. Furthermore, the `strategic_contradiction_index` successfully identified texts with rhetorically complex or mixed messaging, highlighting a nuanced aspect of political communication often missed by simpler analytical models. While limited by the small sample size and the absence of speaker metadata, this pilot analysis demonstrates the CFF's potential as a sophisticated tool for mapping the landscape of political discourse and generating testable hypotheses about its function.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Two Opposing Rhetorical Syndromes Dominate the Corpus:** The analysis identified two powerful, internally consistent rhetorical patterns. A "Fragmentative Syndrome" strongly links `tribal_dominance` with `fear` (r = +0.996) and `enmity` (r = +0.97). A "Cohesive Syndrome" connects `individual_dignity` with `amity` (r = +0.85) and `cohesive_goals` (r = +0.87). This suggests that speakers in this corpus tend to employ coherent, bundled sets of cohesive or fragmentative appeals.
*   **Framework's Oppositional Design Shows Preliminary Validity:** The CFF posits that certain dimensions are in direct opposition. This is supported by strong negative correlations between these pairs, most notably `compersion` vs. `envy` (r = -0.98) and `individual_dignity` vs. `tribal_dominance` (r = -0.78). This indicates the framework effectively captures the intended conceptual tensions in the analyzed discourse.
*   **The Strategic Contradiction Index Uncovers Rhetorical Complexity:** The analysis of the `strategic_contradiction_index` reveals that some texts employ a mixed-messaging strategy. The speech by Bernie Sanders, for instance, registered the highest contradiction score (0.10), indicating a simultaneous use of competing rhetorical appeals (e.g., high `enmity` and moderate `amity`). This metric provides a quantitative measure of rhetorical incoherence or sophistication.
*   **Framework Demonstrates High Discriminatory Power:** Despite the small sample, the `full_cohesion_index` produced a wide range of scores, from John McCain's highly cohesive concession speech (+0.84) to Steve King's highly fragmentative floor speech (-0.74). This demonstrates the framework's capacity to differentiate texts along a meaningful cohesion-fragmentation spectrum.
*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric is Characterized by Threat and Destruction:** The data suggests that high scores in fragmentative dimensions are associated with language of existential threat. For example, the Steve King speech, which scored highest on fragmentation, includes statements framing political outcomes in terms of destruction, such as, "And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment." (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).
*   **Cohesive Rhetoric Emphasizes Solidarity and Shared Identity:** The analysis connects cohesive rhetoric with appeals to broader, unifying principles. The Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speech, which contains cohesive elements, exemplifies this by reframing political struggle away from divisive labels: "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity." (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`).

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed for the nuanced analysis of political and social discourse. The CFF moves beyond simplistic sentiment analysis by measuring discourse along ten distinct, oppositional dimensions organized into five pairs: Hope vs. Fear, Amity vs. Enmity, Compersion vs. Envy, Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance, and Cohesive Goals vs. Fragmentative Goals.

A key innovation of the CFF is its dual-scoring system for each dimension, capturing both the intensity of a rhetorical appeal (`_raw` score) and its prominence or emphasis within the text (`_salience` score). This allows for a more sophisticated analysis that can detect, for example, when a speaker makes a low-intensity but highly salient appeal. The framework uses these base scores to calculate several derived metrics, including a `full_cohesion_index` (a holistic measure of a text's pro-social orientation), five `tension_indices` (measuring conflict between opposing appeals), and a `strategic_contradiction_index` (an average of the tension indices, quantifying a text's overall rhetorical incoherence).

### 4.2 Data Structure and Corpus Description

The corpus for this pilot study consists of four documents of American political discourse:
1.  `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`
2.  `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`
3.  `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`
4.  `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`

The analysis was performed on a pre-processed dataset where each document was scored across the 20 CFF metrics (10 raw scores and 10 salience scores). The statistical analysis functions were automatically generated based on the research context.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis involved several statistical procedures. First, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) were calculated for all base and derived CFF metrics to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus. Second, a Pearson correlation matrix was computed for all 20 base metrics to identify relationships and co-occurrence patterns between rhetorical dimensions. This step was critical for identifying rhetorical "syndromes" and for assessing the construct validity of the CFF's oppositional pairs. Finally, derived metrics, including the `full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index`, were analyzed to identify higher-order patterns and rank documents based on their rhetorical profiles.

### 4.4 Limitations

This study is subject to several significant limitations.
1.  **Extremely Small Sample Size:** With a corpus of only four documents (N=4), the statistical findings are not generalizable. The results should be interpreted as preliminary, illustrative, and hypothesis-generating rather than conclusive. The primary value of this report is as a methodological demonstration of the CFF's analytical capabilities.
2.  **Missing Corpus Manifest:** The `corpus_manifest.json` file was not available. This prevented the execution of the `analyze_rhetorical_profiles_by_speaker` function, making it impossible to group documents by speaker or analyze speaker-specific rhetorical patterns. All analysis is therefore at the document level.
3.  **Lack of External Validation:** The analysis relies solely on the internal statistical patterns within the data. Without linking these scores to external variables (e.g., audience reception, polling data, subsequent political events), the real-world impact of the measured rhetorical strategies remains speculative.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the corpus reveals a wide variance in the deployment of rhetorical strategies. Table 1 presents the summary statistics for all base and derived metrics across the four documents.

On average, fragmentative dimensions such as `envy_raw` (M=0.63), `enmity_raw` (M=0.63), and `fear_raw` (M=0.60) were expressed with slightly higher intensity than their cohesive counterparts like `compersion_raw` (M=0.23), `amity_raw` (M=0.58), and `hope_raw` (M=0.43). This suggests a marginal tendency towards fragmentative rhetoric in this specific sample. The standard deviations are relatively large across most dimensions, indicating significant rhetorical diversity among the four texts. The `full_cohesion_index` shows a mean close to zero (M=-0.11) but with a very large standard deviation (SD=0.67), confirming that the corpus contains texts at both extremes of the cohesion-fragmentation spectrum.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Dimensions and Derived Metrics (N=4)**
| Metric                          | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min    | Max    |

| cohesive_goals_raw              | 0.60  | 0.36      | 0.10   | 0.90   |
| **Derived Indices**             |       |           |        |        |
| strategic_contradiction_index   | 0.05  | 0.04      | 0.01   | 0.10   |
| full_cohesion_index             | -0.11 | 0.67      | -0.74  | 0.84   |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a more holistic view of each document's rhetorical strategy. The `full_cohesion_index` quantifies the overall balance of cohesive versus fragmentative rhetoric, while the `strategic_contradiction_index` measures the degree of internal rhetorical conflict.

**Table 2: Cohesion and Contradiction Scores by Document**
| Document Name                                     | Full Cohesion Index | Strategic Contradiction Index | Rhetorical Profile      |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`                 | 0.840               | 0.014                         | Coherently Cohesive     |
| `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`                 | -0.735              | 0.044                         | Coherently Fragmentative|
| `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`      | -0.370              | 0.102                         | Contradictory Fragmentative|
| `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt` | -0.175              | 0.036                         | Mildly Fragmentative    |

As shown in Table 2, the framework effectively categorizes the documents into distinct profiles. John McCain's speech is an archetype of **Coherently Cohesive** rhetoric, with a very high cohesion score and the lowest contradiction score. This indicates a consistent, pro-social message. In stark contrast, Steve King's speech exemplifies **Coherently Fragmentative** rhetoric, with a strongly negative cohesion score and a relatively low contradiction score, suggesting a consistently divisive message. This is supported by textual evidence from the speech that frames political action in terms of destruction: "And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment." (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).

The speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez present more complex profiles. The Sanders speech is particularly noteworthy for its high `strategic_contradiction_index` (0.102), the highest in the corpus. This suggests a message that simultaneously leverages powerful fragmentative appeals (e.g., high `enmity_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw`) and cohesive ones, resulting in a rhetorically tense and complex communication style.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix (Table 3) is central to understanding the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies in the corpus. It allows for an assessment of the CFF's construct validity and the identification of rhetorical syndromes. Due to the matrix's size, the following analysis focuses on the most significant relationships.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix for CFF Raw Score Dimensions (Selected Pairs)**
| Dimension 1              | Dimension 2                 | Correlation (r) | Interpretation                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Oppositional Pairs (Validity Check)** |                             |                 |                                              |
| compersion_raw           | envy_raw                    | -0.98           | Very Strong Negative (Supports CFF structure)|
| individual_dignity_raw   | tribal_dominance_raw        | -0.78           | Strong Negative (Supports CFF structure)     |
| cohesive_goals_raw       | fragmentative_goals_raw     | -0.63           | Moderate Negative (Supports CFF structure)   |
| hope_raw                 | fear_raw                    | -0.57           | Moderate Negative (Supports CFF structure)   |
| amity_raw                | enmity_raw                  | -0.51           | Moderate Negative (Supports CFF structure)   |
| **Fragmentative Syndrome** |                             |                 |                                              |
| fear_raw                 | tribal_dominance_raw        | +0.996          | Near-Perfect Positive                        |
| fragmentative_goals_raw  | tribal_dominance_raw        | +0.99           | Very Strong Positive                         |
| enmity_raw               | tribal_dominance_raw        | +0.97           | Very Strong Positive                         |
| **Cohesive Syndrome**    |                             |                 |                                              |
| cohesive_goals_raw       | individual_dignity_raw      | +0.87           | Strong Positive                              |
| amity_raw                | individual_dignity_raw      | +0.85           | Strong Positive                              |
| cohesive_goals_raw       | amity_raw                   | +0.999          | Near-Perfect Positive                        |

#### 5.3.1 Preliminary Validation of Framework Structure

A core premise of the CFF is that its dimensional pairs are conceptually oppositional. If the framework is valid for this corpus, we should observe negative correlations between these pairs. The data provides strong preliminary support for this premise. As seen in Table 3, all five oppositional pairs show negative correlations, ranging from moderate to very strong. The near-perfect negative correlation between `compersion_raw` and `envy_raw` (r = -0.98) is particularly striking, suggesting they function as true opposites in this dataset. This pattern indicates that, within these texts, an increase in rhetoric celebrating others' success is almost perfectly mirrored by a decrease in rhetoric expressing resentment of it.

#### 5.3.2 Identification of Rhetorical Meta-Strategies

Beyond validating the framework, the correlation matrix reveals two powerful meta-strategies, or "syndromes," where multiple dimensions are deployed in concert.

1.  **The Fragmentative Syndrome:** There is an exceptionally strong cluster of positive correlations among `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, `envy`, and `fragmentative_goals`. The correlation between `fear_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw` is nearly perfect (r = +0.996). This indicates that when speakers in this corpus adopt a rhetoric of in-group preference, they almost invariably pair it with appeals to fear, hostility towards out-groups, and goals framed as destructive or zero-sum. This suggests a coherent rhetorical package designed to mobilize a base through threat and division. The rhetoric of Steve King, which scores high on all these dimensions, appears to exemplify this syndrome. His speech contains language that simultaneously invokes a protected group and a threat of destruction, as in the statement: "And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment." (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).

2.  **The Cohesive Syndrome:** A similarly strong, though opposing, cluster exists among `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `amity`, `compersion`, and `cohesive_goals`. The near-perfect correlation between `cohesive_goals_raw` and `amity_raw` (r = +0.999) is the cornerstone of this syndrome. This suggests a rhetorical strategy that tightly binds pro-social relationships with appeals to shared, constructive objectives. This approach is exemplified in the rhetoric of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who explicitly links a cohesive goal (class solidarity) with amity (rejecting partisan division): "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity." (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This statement textually confirms the statistical link between cohesive goals and a form of amity.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The identification of these two opposing syndromes is the central finding of this analysis. It suggests that the political discourse within this small corpus is not a random assortment of appeals but is largely organized along a primary axis of cohesion versus fragmentation. Speakers do not simply mix-and-match appeals; they tend to draw from one of two coherent rhetorical playbooks.

An interesting anomaly is found in the Steve King speech. While overwhelmingly fragmentative, it contains a non-trivial appeal to `individual_dignity`, as evidenced by the quote: "That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally." (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). This is a direct contradiction to the speech's dominant `tribal_dominance` theme. This finding highlights the CFF's ability to capture such nuances. While the overall `strategic_contradiction_index` for this speech is low, the `identity_tension` score (0.08) is the second-highest in the corpus, pinpointing the exact locus of this rhetorical conflict. This suggests the speaker may be attempting to cloak a tribalistic message in the universalist language of individual rights, a sophisticated strategy that warrants further investigation.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the CFF demonstrates considerable effectiveness in several key areas:

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, particularly through its `full_cohesion_index`, effectively separated the four documents into distinct rhetorical profiles (Cohesive, Fragmentative, Contradictory). The large standard deviation of the index (0.67) on such a small sample indicates its sensitivity to rhetorical differences.
*   **Construct Validity:** The strong negative correlations between oppositional pairs provide preliminary evidence for the framework's construct validity. The dimensions behave as theoretically predicted, which is a prerequisite for meaningful analysis.
*   **Insight Generation:** The analysis successfully moved beyond simple descriptive statistics to identify complex meta-strategies (the Cohesive and Fragmentative syndromes) and nuanced rhetorical patterns (the `identity_tension` in the King speech). The `strategic_contradiction_index` in particular offers a novel way to quantify rhetorical complexity.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF's dimensions appear highly relevant to the analyzed texts. The strong correlations and wide variance in scores suggest that the framework captures core elements of the political discourse present in the corpus. The framework's language of cohesion and fragmentation seems well-suited to describing the primary tensions in these documents.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this pilot study, while preliminary, have several important implications. The primary theoretical insight is the identification of two opposing rhetorical syndromes. This suggests that political discourse may be more structured than often assumed, organized along a central axis of cohesion vs. fragmentation. The Fragmentative Syndrome—linking tribalism, fear, and enmity—and the Cohesive Syndrome—linking dignity, amity, and shared goals—can be viewed as two competing "logics" for political persuasion. This finding provides a clear, empirically-grounded structure for understanding political communication and allows for the classification of texts based on which logic they primarily employ.

The concept of `strategic_contradiction` also emerges as a significant contribution. While the McCain and King speeches represent "pure" archetypes of cohesive and fragmentative rhetoric, the Sanders speech suggests a third, mixed archetype. This "Contradictory" style may be a deliberate strategy to appeal to multiple audiences at once, or it may reflect an unresolved tension in a political ideology. Future research could investigate the electoral or social effectiveness of these three distinct rhetorical profiles: Coherently Cohesive, Coherently Fragmentative, and Strategically Contradictory.

The limitations of this study pave the way for future research. A larger, more diverse corpus is needed to confirm whether these rhetorical syndromes are a universal feature of political discourse or specific to this small sample. A longitudinal analysis could track how the use of these syndromes changes over time or in response to major events. Furthermore, linking CFF scores to external data—such as polling, media coverage, or voting records—is the critical next step to move from describing rhetorical strategy to explaining its real-world effects. For example, one could test the hypothesis that higher `full_cohesion_index` scores in a politician's rhetoric correlate with higher bipartisan approval ratings.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.1 serves as a successful methodological pilot. Despite the significant limitation of its small sample size, the analysis demonstrates the framework's capacity to produce nuanced, multi-layered insights into political rhetoric.

The study's key contributions are threefold. First, it provided preliminary empirical support for the CFF's theoretical structure, showing that its oppositional dimensions are negatively correlated in practice. Second, it identified two coherent and opposing meta-strategies—a Fragmentative Syndrome and a Cohesive Syndrome—that appear to structure the discourse within the corpus. Third, it demonstrated the utility of novel metrics like the `full_cohesion_index` and `strategic_contradiction_index` to classify texts and quantify their rhetorical complexity.

By moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to map the relationships between complex rhetorical appeals, this approach offers a powerful lens for social science research. It provides a rigorous, replicable method for dissecting political language and generating testable hypotheses about its function and impact on democratic health. Future work building on this pilot study has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how language builds or breaks the bonds of social cohesion.
