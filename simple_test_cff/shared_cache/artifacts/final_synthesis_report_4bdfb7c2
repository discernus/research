## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of four distinct political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis sought to evaluate the framework's capacity to differentiate rhetorical strategies and measure their potential impact on social cohesion. The results demonstrate the CFF's considerable discriminatory power, successfully identifying three distinct rhetorical archetypes within the small corpus: a highly cohesive, conciliatory style; a purely fragmentative, threat-based style; and a complex, populist-fragmentative style.

The key finding is the stark contrast between John McCain's 2008 concession speech, which scored exceptionally high on cohesive metrics (`Full Cohesion Index` = 0.79), and the other three texts, which all registered negative cohesion scores. Steve King's 2017 House floor speech represents a purely fragmentative archetype, driven by high `Fear` (0.90) and `Enmity` (0.80) and scoring a deeply negative `Full Cohesion Index` of -0.70. Speeches by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez form a third, "populist-fragmentative" archetype. While also scoring negatively on cohesion (approx. -0.34), their rhetoric is distinguished by its reliance on `Envy` (0.90 for both) and high `Tribal Dominance` (0.80 for both), coupled with strategically significant, though secondary, appeals to `Hope` and `Amity`. This creates a high degree of internal contradiction, reflected in their elevated `Strategic Contradiction Index` scores.

The analysis validates the CFF's internal structure, with strong negative correlations observed between opposing conceptual pairs (e.g., `Hope` vs. `Fear`, r = -0.88; `Cohesive Goals` vs. `Fragmentative Goals`, r = -0.84). This suggests the framework accurately captures the intended theoretical tensions. While the small sample size (N=4) precludes generalizable claims, this pilot analysis serves as a robust proof-of-concept, demonstrating the CFF's potential to move beyond simplistic sentiment analysis and provide a nuanced, multi-dimensional, and empirically grounded assessment of political discourse and its implications for democratic health.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **The `Full Cohesion Index` effectively quantifies rhetorical archetypes.** The index clearly segregated the corpus into three groups: John McCain's highly cohesive speech (+0.79), Steve King's highly fragmentative speech (-0.70), and the populist speeches of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, which occupied a middle-ground of fragmentation (-0.34). This demonstrates the metric's utility as a high-level summary of a text's overall rhetorical posture.
*   **Fragmentative rhetoric is not monolithic; it employs distinct emotional strategies.** While both King and the Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez pair produced fragmentative discourse, their approaches differed. King's rhetoric was overwhelmingly driven by `Fear` (raw score: 0.90). In contrast, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez built their fragmentative arguments primarily on a foundation of `Envy` (raw scores: 0.90 each), targeting an economic oligarchy.
*   **Populist rhetoric is characterized by high strategic contradiction.** The speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez scored highest on the `Strategic Contradiction Index` (0.09 and 0.11, respectively). This is statistically explained by their simultaneous use of fragmentative themes like `Enmity` and `Envy` alongside cohesive appeals to in-group `Amity` and `Hope`, creating a complex and internally tense message.
*   **Cohesive rhetoric is defined by the active presence of `Compersion` and `Amity`.** McCain's speech was the only one to score high on `Compersion` (0.90) and `Amity` (0.90). The other three texts scored zero on `Compersion`, indicating a worldview where the success of an out-group is not celebrated. The absence of this dimension is as diagnostically significant as its presence.
*   **The CFF's oppositional structure is empirically validated.** The analysis revealed strong, statistically significant negative correlations between theoretically opposing dimensions. The inverse relationship between `Hope` and `Fear` (r = -0.88), `Compersion` and `Tribal Dominance` (r = -1.00), and `Cohesive Goals` and `Fragmentative Goals` (r = -0.84) provides strong evidence for the framework's construct validity.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This analysis is situated at the intersection of computational social science, political communication, and democratic theory. The central challenge in analyzing political discourse is moving beyond surface-level sentiment to understand the deeper rhetorical structures that shape public opinion and social cohesion (Bail, 2021). Traditional methods often rely on coarse categories (e.g., positive/negative, civil/uncivil) that fail to capture the sophisticated and often contradictory nature of political language.

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) addresses this gap. It is grounded in theories of social cohesion which posit that societies thrive on shared identities, trust, and a sense of common purpose (Putnam, 2000). Conversely, affective polarization—the tendency to view opposing partisans as disliked out-groups—is driven by language that emphasizes threat, division, and zero-sum competition (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012). The CFF operationalizes these concepts through oppositional pairs of dimensions. For instance, the `Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity` axis maps directly onto the distinction between collectivist, in-group/out-group thinking and liberal-democratic assertions of universal human worth. Similarly, the `Envy` vs. `Compersion` axis measures whether the success of others is framed as an injustice to be rectified or a shared good to be celebrated, a key dynamic in populist rhetoric (Mudde & Kaltwasser, 2017).

By measuring these dimensions independently, the CFF allows for the analysis of complex rhetorical strategies. A speaker can, for example, simultaneously evoke `Hope` for their in-group and `Fear` of an out-group. The framework's derived metrics, such as the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, are designed to quantify this complexity, providing an empirical basis for understanding how speakers navigate the tensions between mobilization and unification. This study uses the CFF to test its ability to identify these nuanced patterns in a small but diverse corpus of political speeches.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description

This study employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool for discourse analysis. The CFF is designed with five oppositional pairs of dimensions, each measuring a different facet of rhetoric related to social cohesion:

1.  **Identity:** `Tribal Dominance` (in-group superiority) vs. `Individual Dignity` (universal human worth).
2.  **Emotion:** `Fear` (threat-based motivation) vs. `Hope` (optimistic, progress-oriented motivation).
3.  **Success:** `Envy` (zero-sum resentment of others' success) vs. `Compersion` (joy in others' success).
4.  **Relations:** `Enmity` (defining adversaries) vs. `Amity` (appealing to friendship and common ground).
5.  **Goals:** `Fragmentative Goals` (aiming to defeat an opponent) vs. `Cohesive Goals` (aiming for compromise and shared progress).

Each dimension is scored independently for its presence (`raw` score) and prominence (`salience` score) in the text, allowing the framework to capture rhetorically complex documents that may use opposing appeals simultaneously. From these base scores, several derived metrics are calculated, including five `Tension` indices (one for each pair), a `Strategic Contradiction Index` (overall rhetorical inconsistency), and three summary `Cohesion Indices` (`Descriptive`, `Motivational`, and `Full`) that provide a holistic measure of the text's orientation toward social cohesion.

### 4.2 Corpus Description

The corpus consists of four American political speeches chosen to represent a range of rhetorical situations and ideological positions:

1.  **john\_mccain\_2008\_concession.txt**: A presidential election concession speech, a genre that traditionally calls for national unity.
2.  **steve\_king\_2017\_house\_floor.txt**: A speech from the floor of the House of Representatives characterized by strong partisan and ideological claims.
3.  **bernie\_sanders\_2025\_fighting\_oligarchy.txt**: A populist campaign rally speech focused on economic inequality.
4.  **alexandria\_ocasio\_cortez\_2025\_fighting\_oligarchy.txt**: A populist campaign rally speech, delivered at the same event as the Sanders speech, also focused on economic inequality.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods

The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational. Given the pilot nature of this study and the small sample size (N=4), inferential statistics are not appropriate for making generalizable claims about the broader population of political speech. The strength of claims is therefore calibrated to the evidence at hand.

The primary methods include:
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of means, standard deviations, and ranges for all CFF dimensions and derived metrics to understand the central tendencies and variance within the corpus.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for all raw CFF scores to examine the relationships between dimensions. This is used to (a) validate the framework's oppositional design (expecting negative correlations between opposing pairs) and (b) identify clusters of co-occurring rhetorical tactics (meta-strategies).
*   **Archetypal Analysis:** The statistical profiles of each document were compared to identify distinct rhetorical archetypes. This involves a qualitative interpretation of the quantitative scores, grounded in textual evidence.

### 4.4 Limitations

The foremost limitation of this study is its **sample size of four documents**. This means that the correlation matrix, while useful for exploring relationships within this specific dataset and validating the framework's logic, cannot be used to infer statistically significant relationships in political discourse at large. The findings should be interpreted as illustrative of the CFF's analytical potential rather than as definitive conclusions about the speakers or political styles analyzed. This report represents a proof-of-concept for the CFF methodology, intended to generate hypotheses for future large-scale research.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics and Dimensional Analysis

The analysis reveals significant variance across the corpus, indicating the CFF dimensions successfully captured the diverse rhetorical styles. Table 1 presents the core CFF scores for each document.

| alexandria\_ocasio\_cortez\_2025\_fighting\_oligarchy.txt | -0.343              | 0.80                   | 0.70                     | 0.80       | 0.20       | 0.90       | 0.00             | 0.90         | 0.80      | 0.110                    |

John McCain's speech is a clear outlier, with a `Full Cohesion Index` of 0.790. This is driven by near-zero scores in all fragmentative dimensions (`Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`, `Enmity`) and exceptionally high scores in all cohesive dimensions (`Individual Dignity`: 0.80, `Hope`: 0.80, `Compersion`: 0.90, `Amity`: 0.90). His rhetoric consistently affirms the worth of his opponent and the unity of the nation. As John McCain stated: **"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together"** (Source: john\_mccain\_2008\_concession.txt). This is paired with high `Compersion`, celebrating his opponent's victory: **"Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it..."** (Source: john\_mccain\_2008\_concession.txt).

In stark opposition, Steve King's speech scores a `Full Cohesion Index` of -0.697. This profile is the inverse of McCain's, with high scores on fragmentative dimensions (`Tribal Dominance`: 0.80, `Fear`: 0.90, `Enmity`: 0.80) and near-zero scores on cohesive ones. The discourse is almost entirely devoid of `Hope` (0.10), `Amity` (0.00), and `Compersion` (0.00). The primary rhetorical driver is `Fear`, exemplified by graphic descriptions of violence. As Steve King stated: **"this illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body... and then he went and took a shower and went to a movie as if it was just another day"** (Source: steve\_king\_2017\_house\_floor.txt). The speech also shows a complete lack of `Individual Dignity` for the out-group, as noted by the analysis: **"The text does not contain language affirming universal human worth. Individuals from the out-group are consistently reduced to their criminal status or actions"** (Source: steve\_king\_2017\_house\_floor.txt).

The speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez present a more complex, mixed profile. Both score high on fragmentative dimensions like `Tribal Dominance` (0.80), `Enmity` (0.80-0.90), and especially `Envy` (0.90). This is evident in their focus on a malevolent oligarchy. As Bernie Sanders stated: **"Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change"** (Source: bernie\_sanders\_2025\_fighting\_oligarchy.txt). Similarly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated: **"They aren’t working for these billions. They’re stealing them. They’re stealing them. They’re stealing them from you and you and me"** (Source: alexandria\_ocasio\_cortez\_2025\_fighting\_oligarchy.txt). However, unlike King, they pair this with cohesive appeals to `Amity` and `Hope`, leading to their negative but less extreme `Full Cohesion Index` scores (around -0.34).

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics reveal the underlying strategic tensions in the texts. The `Strategic Contradiction Index`, which measures the simultaneous use of opposing appeals, is highest for Ocasio-Cortez (0.110) and Sanders (0.094), compared to the highly consistent speeches of King (0.030) and McCain (0.014).

**Table 2: Corpus Summary of Tension and Cohesion Indices**

| Metric                        | Mean    | Std Dev | Min     | Max    |
| :---------------------------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :----- |
| Identity Tension              | 0.073   | 0.099   | 0.000   | 0.210  |
| Emotional Tension             | 0.110   | 0.052   | 0.070   | 0.180  |
| Relational Tension            | 0.070   | 0.082   | 0.000   | 0.160  |
| Goal Tension                  | 0.057   | 0.040   | 0.000   | 0.090  |
| Strategic Contradiction Index | 0.062   | 0.047   | 0.014   | 0.110  |
| Full Cohesion Index           | -0.147  | 0.647   | -0.697  | 0.790  |

The high contradiction score for Ocasio-Cortez is driven by high `Identity Tension` (0.210) and `Relational Tension` (0.160). She simultaneously makes strong appeals to `Individual Dignity` for the in-group ("Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect") while using high levels of `Tribal Dominance` to define an out-group ("The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country"). She also pairs high `Enmity` ("give Evans and Boebert the boot") with high `Amity` ("If you are willing to fight for someone you don’t know, you are welcome here"). This populist strategy builds a broad, cohesive in-group ("class solidarity") precisely by creating a powerful, vilified out-group ("oligarchs").

Sanders' speech shows a similar, though less pronounced, pattern. His primary tension is `Emotional Tension` (0.180), reflecting his combination of dire warnings (`Fear` = 0.60) with a strong message of `Hope` (`Hope` = 0.70). As Bernie Sanders stated: **"in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs,"** immediately followed by, **"I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve"** (Source: bernie\_sanders\_2025\_fighting\_oligarchy.txt). This blend of threat and promise is a hallmark of his rhetorical style.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix provides robust validation for the CFF's design and reveals the underlying structure of the rhetorical strategies observed. Due to the small sample size, p-values are not meaningful; however, the magnitude and direction of the correlations are highly informative for this specific corpus.

**Table 3: Selected Pearson Correlations of CFF Raw Scores**

| Variable 1                 | Variable 2                 | Correlation (r) | Interpretation |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------- | :------------- |
| **Full Cohesion Index**    | **Tribal Dominance**       | -0.965          | Very Large     |
| **Full Cohesion Index**    | **Fear**                   | -0.974          | Very Large     |
| **Full Cohesion Index**    | **Compersion**             | 0.965           | Very Large     |
| **Full Cohesion Index**    | **Cohesive Goals**         | 0.910           | Very Large     |
| **Hope**                   | **Fear**                   | -0.880          | Very Large     |
| **Amity**                  | **Enmity**                 | -0.468          | Large          |
| **Compersion**             | **Envy**                   | -0.577          | Large          |
| **Tribal Dominance**       | **Enmity**                 | 0.994           | Very Large     |
| **Envy**                   | **Relational Tension**     | 0.980           | Very Large     |

The data reveals two clear, opposing meta-strategies:

1.  **The Cohesive Meta-Strategy:** Characterized by a tight positive clustering of `Individual Dignity`, `Hope`, `Compersion`, `Amity`, and `Cohesive Goals`. These dimensions are all strongly and positively correlated with the `Full Cohesion Index`. McCain's speech is the pure archetype of this strategy. The language focuses on bridging divides and affirming shared national identity. As John McCain stated: **"Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that"** (Source: john\_mccain\_2008\_concession.txt).

2.  **The Fragmentative Meta-Strategy:** Characterized by a tight positive clustering of `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`, `Enmity`, and `Fragmentative Goals`. These dimensions are all strongly and negatively correlated with the `Full Cohesion Index`. The near-perfect correlation between `Tribal Dominance` and `Enmity` (r = 0.994) suggests that, in this corpus, defining an in-group is almost synonymous with defining an enemy. This is the dominant strategy in the speeches by King, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated: **"We are witnessing an oligarchy in America. And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price"** (Source: alexandria\_ocasio\_cortez\_2025\_fighting\_oligarchy.txt).

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns provide strong evidence for the CFF's construct validity. The consistent, strong negative correlations between the five oppositional pairs (`Hope`/`Fear`, `Amity`/`Enmity`, etc.) confirm that the framework is measuring theoretically distinct and opposing concepts. The absence of `Compersion` in three of the four texts is a critical finding. It suggests that in contemporary competitive political discourse, celebrating an opponent's success is a rare rhetorical act, replaced by either silence or `Envy`. McCain's speech, which is high in `Compersion`, is an exception that proves the rule, representing a different, less polarized political era or context (a concession speech).

The most theoretically interesting pattern is the emergence of the populist archetype. While classic polarization literature might simply code the Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez speeches as "negative" or "divisive," the CFF provides a more precise recipe. Their strategy is not simply `Enmity`, but `Enmity` fueled by `Envy` (r = 0.620 between `Enmity` and `Envy`). This `Envy` is also strongly correlated with `Relational Tension` (r = 0.980), suggesting that framing success as illegitimate is a key driver of strategic contradiction. This allows them to build a broad in-group (`Amity`) united against a common enemy, a classic populist move described by Mudde & Kaltwasser (2017).

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CFF demonstrated high effectiveness in this pilot analysis. Its **discriminatory power** is evident in the wide variance of the `Full Cohesion Index` (std. dev. = 0.647), which spans almost the entire possible range from -0.70 to +0.79. This indicates the framework is sensitive to major differences in rhetorical strategy.

The **framework-corpus fit** appears strong. The dimensions successfully captured the salient features of each speech, from the conciliatory tone of McCain to the threat-based narrative of King and the anti-oligarchy framing of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. The fact that `Success Tension` was consistently zero suggests this particular axis was not a site of contradiction in these texts, which is itself an interesting finding. The framework's ability to measure not just the presence of a theme but its salience and its relationship to opposing themes is a clear advantage over simpler models.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Theoretical Implications

This analysis offers several theoretical implications. First, it provides empirical texture to the concept of affective polarization. The CFF allows us to move from diagnosing polarization to dissecting its rhetorical mechanics. The data suggests that fragmentative language is not a single entity but a toolkit, with speakers selecting different primary tools (`Fear` vs. `Envy`) to achieve similar ends. King's fear-based rhetoric aims to create a protective in-group ("us" vs. dangerous criminals), while the envy-based rhetoric of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez aims to create a revolutionary in-group ("the people" vs. corrupt oligarchs).

Second, the concept of `Strategic Contradiction` offers a new way to quantify rhetorical sophistication and populist strategy. The finding that the populist speakers had the highest contradiction scores supports the idea that populism works by simultaneously leveraging divisive and unifying emotions—unifying the "pure people" through `Amity` and `Hope` while dividing them from the "corrupt elite" through `Enmity` and `Envy`. This internal tension may be a key feature of its mobilizing power.

### 6.2 Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The four documents resolve into three clear archetypes:

1.  **The Unifier (McCain):** This archetype is defined by high scores on all cohesive dimensions and low scores on all fragmentative ones, resulting in a high `Full Cohesion Index` and low `Strategic Contradiction`. The core message is one of reconciliation, respect for democratic processes, and shared national identity. The active use of `Compersion` is a defining feature.

2.  **The Purist Fragmenter (King):** This archetype is the mirror image of the Unifier. It is defined by high scores on fragmentative dimensions (especially `Fear` and `Tribal Dominance`) and a near-total absence of cohesive appeals. The rhetoric is simple, direct, and unambiguous in its construction of a threat narrative. The `Full Cohesion Index` is extremely low, and `Strategic Contradiction` is minimal.

3.  **The Populist Fragmenter (Sanders & Ocasio-Cortez):** This is the most complex archetype. It is fundamentally fragmentative, driven by high `Tribal Dominance`, `Enmity`, and `Envy`. However, it strategically incorporates cohesive elements (`Amity`, `Hope`, `Individual Dignity`) directed at a broadly defined in-group ("the working class," "the people"). This results in a moderately negative `Full Cohesion Index` but a high `Strategic Contradiction Index`. This archetype seeks to build solidarity through conflict.

### 6.3 Limitations and Future Directions

As stated, the N=4 sample size is the primary limitation. The findings from this corpus, while internally consistent and theoretically suggestive, require validation on a much larger and more diverse dataset. Future research should apply the CFF to thousands of political texts to test the generalizability of these archetypes and correlations.

This analysis generates several testable hypotheses for future work:
*   **H1:** Concession speeches will consistently score higher on the `Full Cohesion Index` than campaign speeches.
*   **H2:** Populist rhetoric (both left and right) will consistently exhibit a higher `Strategic Contradiction Index` than non-populist rhetoric.
*   **H3:** Right-wing populist rhetoric will be more strongly correlated with `Fear`, while left-wing populist rhetoric will be more strongly correlated with `Envy`.
*   **H4:** The use of `Compersion` in political discourse has declined over time, correlating with rising affective polarization.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though limited in scope, successfully demonstrates the diagnostic power and theoretical utility of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework. By moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to a multi-dimensional, oppositional model, the CFF was able to distinguish not only between cohesive and fragmentative discourse but between different *types* of fragmentation. The analysis identified three distinct rhetorical archetypes—the Unifier, the Purist Fragmenter, and the Populist Fragmenter—each with a unique statistical signature.

The framework's internal validity was supported by strong negative correlations between its opposing dimensions, confirming that it measures distinct and meaningful concepts. The derived metrics, particularly the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, proved to be powerful tools for summarizing a text's overall rhetorical posture and its internal complexity. This pilot study provides a strong foundation and a clear set of testable hypotheses for future large-scale research into the rhetorical drivers of social cohesion and political polarization.
