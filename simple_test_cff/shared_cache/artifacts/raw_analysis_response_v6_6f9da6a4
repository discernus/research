    "analysis_notes": "The speaker employs a strong populist, class-based framing, creating a clear adversarial dynamic between 'working people' and a 'billionaire oligarchy'. This results in high scores on dimensions like Enmity, Envy, and Tribal Dominance (framed by class). Simultaneously, the speech makes strong appeals for in-group unity and universal dignity, leading to high scores in Amity and Individual Dignity. The rhetoric is a classic example of mobilizing a base by identifying a common enemy and a shared, protective goal."
