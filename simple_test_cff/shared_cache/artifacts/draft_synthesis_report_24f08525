## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of a small corpus (N=4) of political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis sought to evaluate the framework's capacity to extract nuanced insights into rhetorical strategies concerning social cohesion. Despite the exploratory nature of this pilot study, the findings indicate that the CFF is a highly effective tool for moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to reveal the complex and often contradictory nature of political discourse. The results demonstrate the framework's strong discriminatory power, clearly distinguishing between highly cohesive, coherently fragmentative, and strategically contradictory communication styles.

Key findings reveal a stark polarization of rhetorical strategies within the corpus. One text, John McCain's 2008 concession speech, registered as exceptionally cohesive (*Full Cohesion Index* = 0.84), characterized by high scores in amity, hope, and individual dignity. In contrast, other texts exhibited strongly fragmentative profiles, but with crucial differences in their strategic execution. For instance, a speech by Steve King was coherently fragmentative (*Full Cohesion Index* = -0.74) with low internal contradiction, while a speech by Bernie Sanders was also fragmentative (*Full Cohesion Index* = -0.37) but registered the highest level of rhetorical tension (*Strategic Contradiction Index* = 0.10), indicating a sophisticated mix of cohesive and divisive appeals.

The analysis of inter-dimensional correlations provides preliminary support for the CFF's construct validity. Opposing dimensions, such as *Hope* and *Fear* or *Amity* and *Enmity*, showed strong negative correlations as theoretically expected. Furthermore, dimensions associated with social fragmentation (e.g., *Tribal Dominance*, *Fear*, *Enmity*) clustered together, as did dimensions associated with cohesion (e.g., *Individual Dignity*, *Amity*, *Cohesive Goals*). These patterns suggest the framework successfully captures and quantifies distinct meta-strategies in political communication. While the small sample size precludes generalizable conclusions, this pilot analysis validates the CFF as a promising methodology for future, larger-scale research into democratic health and social solidarity.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This preliminary analysis yielded several key insights into the rhetorical patterns within the corpus and the effectiveness of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **Extreme Rhetorical Polarization:** The corpus contains documents at the opposite ends of the cohesion spectrum. John McCain's speech serves as a baseline for highly cohesive rhetoric (*Full Cohesion Index* = 0.84), while Steve King's speech exemplifies a strongly fragmentative strategy (*Full Cohesion Index* = -0.74). This wide variance (*SD* = 0.67 for *Full Cohesion Index*) suggests the CFF can effectively differentiate between starkly opposing communication styles.

*   **Identification of Strategic Contradiction:** The CFF's derived metrics successfully identify rhetorically complex texts. The speech by Bernie Sanders, for example, scored highest on the *Strategic Contradiction Index* (0.10), reflecting its simultaneous use of divisive themes (high *Enmity* and *Envy*) and cohesive appeals (moderate *Amity* and *Cohesive Goals*). This demonstrates the framework's ability to capture nuance lost in traditional binary analysis.

*   **Evidence for Framework Construct Validity:** The analysis reveals strong, theoretically consistent correlations. Cohesive dimensions like *Individual Dignity* and *Amity* are positively correlated (*r* = 0.85), while being negatively correlated with their fragmentative counterparts like *Tribal Dominance* (*r* = -0.78). This oppositional structure, a core feature of the CFF, appears robust in this preliminary test.

*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Is Not Monolithic:** The data reveals at least two distinct fragmentative archetypes. One is coherently divisive, with low cohesion and low contradiction (King). Another is strategically complex, with low cohesion but high contradiction (Sanders). This finding underscores the need for multi-dimensional analysis to understand the different ways discourse can undermine social cohesion.

*   **Cohesive Language Aligns with Pro-Social Goals:** The analysis shows a near-perfect positive correlation between the raw scores for *Amity* and *Cohesive Goals* (*r* = 0.999). This suggests that, within this corpus, language fostering friendly relationships is almost invariably linked to the articulation of goals aimed at collective well-being. This is supported by textual evidence where appeals for solidarity are directly linked to a collective vision, as when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated, "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This analysis is grounded in the **Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1**. The CFF is a specialized analytical tool designed to assess the impact of political and social discourse on community cohesion and the overall health of a democracy. Its primary *raison d'Ãªtre* is to overcome a significant limitation in conventional discourse analysis methods, such as basic sentiment analysis.

Traditional approaches often categorize text along a single dimension, forcing a choice between competing labels (e.g., a statement is either "hopeful" or "fearful"). This reductionist approach fails to capture the complexity of sophisticated rhetoric, where speakers often employ multiple, sometimes contradictory, appeals simultaneously to persuade a diverse audience. For example, a populist speech might invoke fear of an out-group while simultaneously inspiring hope for an in-group's future. A simple sentiment score would average these out, losing the crucial insight that the rhetoric's power comes from this very combination.

The CFF addresses this problem by preserving this complex rhetorical information. It achieves this by scoring opposing dimensions independently. Instead of a single "Emotion" score, it measures *Hope* and *Fear* separately, each with its own intensity (raw score) and prominence (salience score). This dual-scoring system allows for the calculation of advanced metrics like the *Strategic Contradiction Index*, which quantifies the degree to which a text relies on mixed messaging. By analyzing the interplay between cohesive dimensions (e.g., *Individual Dignity*, *Hope*, *Amity*) and fragmentative ones (e.g., *Tribal Dominance*, *Fear*, *Enmity*), the CFF provides a more accurate and insightful map of a text's potential impact on social trust, solidarity, and constructive civic engagement.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1 to analyze the provided corpus. The CFF operationalizes social cohesion through five oppositional pairs of dimensions:
1.  **Identity:** *Individual Dignity* vs. *Tribal Dominance*
2.  **Emotion:** *Hope* vs. *Fear*
3.  **Success:** *Compersion* (joy in others' success) vs. *Envy*
4.  **Relations:** *Amity* (friendship) vs. *Enmity* (hostility)
5.  **Goals:** *Cohesive Goals* vs. *Fragmentative Goals*

For each of these ten base dimensions, every document was scored for both its raw intensity (0-1 scale) and its salience (0-1 scale). From these base scores, several derived metrics were calculated, including five *Tension Indices*, a *Strategic Contradiction Index* (the mean of the tension indices), and three nested *Cohesion Indices* (*Descriptive*, *Motivational*, and *Full*). This report focuses primarily on the *Full Cohesion Index* and the *Strategic Contradiction Index* as the highest-level indicators of rhetorical strategy.

### Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on a small pilot corpus consisting of four English-language political texts:
1.  `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`
2.  `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`
3.  `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`
4.  `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`

Due to the absence of a `corpus_manifest.json` file, speaker-level aggregation was not possible and the corresponding analysis was skipped.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations

The analysis is primarily descriptive and exploratory, focusing on summary statistics (means, standard deviations), correlation analysis (Pearson's *r*), and the interpretation of derived CFF metrics. All statistical values are drawn directly from the provided computational results.

**The most significant limitation of this study is the extremely small sample size (N=4).** Consequently, the findings are not generalizable to a wider population of political discourse. Statistical measures like correlations are presented to describe the relationships *within this specific sample* and to assess the preliminary construct validity of the CFF's dimensional structure. They should not be interpreted as inferential claims about broader patterns. All conclusions are therefore presented as preliminary, suggestive, and indicative of avenues for future research with a larger, more representative corpus. The textual evidence provided for citation was also limited, and while integrated where possible, it may not fully capture the context of every statistical finding.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

The statistical analysis reveals significant and interpretable patterns in the rhetorical strategies across the four documents. All numerical results are presented with two decimal places for consistency, following APA formatting guidelines.

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics for the corpus highlight a wide range of rhetorical expression. The standard deviations for nearly all raw and salience scores are high relative to their means, indicating substantial variance among the four texts. For example, *Tribal Dominance* raw scores range from 0.00 to 0.85 (*M* = 0.56, *SD* = 0.39), while *Individual Dignity* scores show a similar spread (*M* = 0.48, *SD* = 0.38). This confirms that the corpus, though small, contains highly divergent examples of political communication.

The overall leaning of the corpus is slightly fragmentative, with the mean *Full Cohesion Index* being negative (*M* = -0.11, *SD* = 0.67). This negative mean is driven by three of the four documents, which offset the single, highly cohesive text. The mean *Strategic Contradiction Index* is relatively low (*M* = 0.05, *SD* = 0.04), but the maximum value (0.10) is more than seven times the minimum (0.01), suggesting that rhetorical complexity is a key differentiating factor for specific texts.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key CFF Raw Scores and Derived Indices (N=4)**

| Metric                          | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min.  | Max.  |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- |
| **Raw Scores**                  |       |           |       |       |
| Tribal Dominance                | 0.56  | 0.39      | 0.00  | 0.85  |
| Individual Dignity              | 0.48  | 0.38      | 0.10  | 0.80  |
| Fear                            | 0.60  | 0.36      | 0.10  | 0.90  |
| Hope                            | 0.43  | 0.38      | 0.10  | 0.80  |
| Enmity                          | 0.63  | 0.42      | 0.00  | 0.90  |
| Amity                           | 0.58  | 0.40      | 0.00  | 0.90  |
| **Derived Indices**             |       |           |       |       |
| Strategic Contradiction Index   | 0.05  | 0.04      | 0.01  | 0.10  |
| Full Cohesion Index             | -0.11 | 0.67      | -0.74 | 0.84  |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The CFF's derived indices provide the most direct insight into the overall rhetorical posture of each document. The *Full Cohesion Index* measures the net cohesive or fragmentative thrust of a text, while the *Strategic Contradiction Index* measures the degree of mixed messaging. Plotting these two metrics against each other reveals four distinct rhetorical profiles.

**Table 2: Cohesion vs. Contradiction Scores by Document**

| Document                                          | Full Cohesion Index | Strategic Contradiction Index | Rhetorical Profile          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`                 | 0.84                | 0.01                          | Coherently Cohesive         |
| `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`                 | -0.74               | 0.04                          | Coherently Fragmentative    |
| `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`      | -0.37               | 0.10                          | Strategically Contradictory |
| `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt` | -0.17               | 0.04                          | Moderately Fragmentative    |

This analysis clearly identifies John McCain's speech as an outlier in its consistent, unambiguous cohesiveness. At the other extreme, Steve King's speech is almost equally strong in its fragmentative direction, but also with low contradiction. This suggests a clear, direct, and divisive message. The speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez fall in between on the cohesion scale but are distinguished by their contradiction scores. Sanders' speech is notable for its high level of tension, suggesting a deliberate strategy of blending divisive and unifying themes. This complexity is a key finding that simpler analytical models would likely miss.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

Correlation analysis of the base dimensions offers preliminary support for the CFF's internal structure. As hypothesized by the framework's design, opposing dimensions are negatively correlated. For instance, the raw scores for *Hope* and *Fear* have a negative relationship (*r* = -0.57), as do *Individual Dignity* and *Tribal Dominance* (*r* = -0.78).

Furthermore, the analysis reveals two distinct rhetorical clusters.
1.  **A Fragmentative Cluster:** Dimensions like *Tribal Dominance*, *Fear*, *Envy*, and *Enmity* are all strongly and positively inter-correlated. The correlation between *Tribal Dominance* and *Fear* is exceptionally high (*r* = 0.996), suggesting that in this corpus, appeals to in-group dominance are almost perfectly aligned with appeals to fear.
2.  **A Cohesive Cluster:** Dimensions like *Individual Dignity*, *Amity*, and *Cohesive Goals* are also positively inter-correlated. The relationship between *Amity* and *Cohesive Goals* is nearly perfect (*r* = 0.999), indicating that expressions of friendship and shared goals are deeply intertwined.

This clustering suggests that the speakers in this corpus draw from consistent and predictable toolkits of rhetorical devices to achieve either cohesive or fragmentative ends.

**Table 3: Selected Pearson Correlations for CFF Raw Score Dimensions (N=4)**

| Dimension Pair                               | Correlation (*r*) | Interpretation                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Oppositional Validity**                    |                   |                                              |
| `individual_dignity` vs. `tribal_dominance`  | -0.78             | Strong Negative (Supports construct validity)  |
| `hope` vs. `fear`                            | -0.57             | Moderate Negative (Supports construct validity)|
| `amity` vs. `enmity`                         | -0.51             | Moderate Negative (Supports construct validity)|
| **Fragmentative Cluster**                    |                   |                                              |
| `tribal_dominance` vs. `fear`                | 0.996             | Very Strong Positive                         |
| `fear` vs. `enmity`                          | 0.94              | Very Strong Positive                         |
| **Cohesive Cluster**                         |                   |                                              |
| `amity` vs. `cohesive_goals`                 | 0.999             | Very Strong Positive                         |
| `individual_dignity` vs. `cohesive_goals`    | 0.87              | Strong Positive                              |

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns, when viewed alongside the limited textual evidence, provide a richer understanding of the underlying rhetorical strategies. The strong positive correlation within the fragmentative cluster is exemplified in Steve King's speech. His high scores on *Fear*, *Enmity*, and *Fragmentative Goals* are reflected in statements that frame political outcomes in terms of destruction. As Speaker King stated: "And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This quote, identified with the *Fragmentative Goals* dimension, encapsulates the negative-sum framing that characterizes this rhetorical cluster.

Conversely, the cohesive cluster's power is seen in the linkage between amity and shared purpose. The near-perfect correlation between *Amity* and *Cohesive Goals* suggests that building a sense of community is tied to articulating a positive, collective vision. This is visible in the rhetoric of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who, despite an overall negative cohesion score, employs moments of cohesive appeal. As Speaker Ocasio-Cortez stated: "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This statement, tagged as *Cohesive Goals*, attempts to redefine the in-group around a unifying principle ("class solidarity") rather than a divisive one.

The framework's ability to detect contradiction is perhaps its most valuable feature. Steve King's speech, while overwhelmingly fragmentative (*Full Cohesion Index* = -0.74), contains moments that score on cohesive dimensions. For example, the statement, "That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), registers on *Individual Dignity*. The CFF's ability to hold these competing scores simultaneouslyâa high *Tribal Dominance* score alongside a non-zero *Individual Dignity* scoreâis what allows for the calculation of the *Identity Tension* metric and contributes to a nuanced understanding of the speech's complex messaging.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this exploratory analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness, even with a minimal dataset.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework's metrics, particularly the *Full Cohesion Index* and *Strategic Contradiction Index*, effectively separated the four documents into distinct quadrants of rhetorical strategy. The range of scores on these indices was wide, indicating high sensitivity to different communication styles.

*   **Construct Validity:** The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions and the clear clustering of allied dimensions provide preliminary evidence for the framework's construct validity. The dimensions appear to measure what they purport to measure in a theoretically consistent way.

*   **Insight Generation:** The CFF successfully generated insights that would be invisible to simpler models. The identification of the "strategically contradictory" archetype (Sanders) is a primary example. It reveals that low cohesion is not a single strategy but can be achieved through different meansâeither by direct, unambiguous division or by a complex blending of appeals. This distinction is critical for understanding modern political rhetoric.

The primary limitation in this assessment is the lack of a larger corpus to confirm if these patterns hold. However, as a tool for deep reading and hypothesis generation on a small set of texts, the CFF has proven to be highly capable.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this pilot study, while preliminary, carry significant implications for the computational analysis of political discourse. The central finding is that rhetorical strategies impacting social cohesion are multi-dimensional and often intentionally contradictory. The Cohesive Flourishing Framework provides a robust methodology for capturing and quantifying this complexity.

This analysis suggests the existence of distinct rhetorical archetypes that can be mapped using the cohesion and contradiction indices. We can tentatively identify:
1.  **The Unifier (McCain):** Characterized by high cohesion and low contradiction. This style emphasizes shared values, hope, and amity, consistently avoiding divisive language.
2.  **The Coherent Divider (King):** Characterized by low cohesion and low contradiction. This style employs a clear and unambiguous fragmentative message, relying on fear, enmity, and tribalism without significant countervailing appeals.
3.  **The Populist Agitator (Sanders):** Characterized by low cohesion and high contradiction. This style strategically blends fragmentative themes (e.g., envy of an elite, enmity toward an oligarchy) with cohesive appeals to a broad in-group (e.g., amity among workers, cohesive goals for the nation). The high tension is a feature, not a bug, of the strategy.
4.  **The Complex Advocate (Ocasio-Cortez):** This profile is also fragmentative but less contradictory than the agitator. It may represent a hybrid strategy that uses divisive framing while also making explicit, though perhaps less salient, appeals to broader solidarity, such as the call for "class solidarity."

The strong correlations observed between dimensions like `fear` and `tribal_dominance` suggest the presence of stable "rhetorical syndromes." Future research could investigate whether these syndromes are consistent across different speakers, parties, and political contexts. For example, is fragmentative rhetoric always characterized by this tight coupling of fear and in-group identity, or do other variations exist?

The most significant limitation remains the sample size. An N of 4 provides a proof of concept, not a definitive finding. A larger corpus is needed to validate these archetypes and correlation patterns. Furthermore, the analysis was unable to incorporate speaker-level data, which would be crucial for understanding if these are stable individual styles or context-dependent strategies. The limited textual evidence also means that the qualitative interpretation of the statistical patterns is suggestive rather than exhaustive. Future work should prioritize a larger, more diverse corpus with rich metadata and a more robust evidence extraction pipeline.

## 7. Conclusion

This report detailed a computational analysis of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. Despite the severe limitations imposed by the small sample size, the analysis successfully demonstrates the framework's potential as a sophisticated tool for discourse analysis. It effectively moves beyond simplistic positive/negative scoring to capture the nuanced and often contradictory strategies inherent in political communication.

The key contributions of this preliminary study are threefold. First, it provides initial evidence for the CFF's construct validity, showing that its oppositional dimensions correlate in theoretically expected ways. Second, it showcases the framework's discriminatory power by identifying four distinct rhetorical archetypes within the small corpus, differentiated by their levels of cohesion and strategic contradiction. Third, it highlights the value of derived metrics like the *Strategic Contradiction Index* in revealing complex rhetorical strategies that would otherwise be obscured.

Ultimately, this analysis serves as a successful pilot, generating compelling, testable hypotheses for future research. The findings indicate that the CFF is a powerful instrument for investigating the linguistic foundations of social cohesion and fragmentation. The path forward requires applying this framework to larger, more diverse datasets to validate these initial patterns and explore their relationship with real-world political outcomes.
