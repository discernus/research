### Section 1: Abstract & *Raison d'Ãªtre*

**What is this framework?**
The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) is a comprehensive tool for analyzing political and social discourse to understand its impact on community cohesion and democratic health. It moves beyond simple sentiment analysis to reveal sophisticated patterns in how language builds or undermines social solidarity, trust, and constructive civic engagement.

**What problem does it solve?**
CFF addresses a critical gap in discourse analysis by providing a methodology that preserves complex rhetorical information. Traditional analysis often forces artificial choices (e.g., a text is "hopeful" or "fearful"), losing nuance when sophisticated communication employs competing appeals simultaneously. CFF's independent scoring of opposing dimensions (e.g., Hope vs. Fear) captures this complexity, enabling a more accurate and insightful analysis of...

# ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS

## Level 1: Basic Statistical Interpretation
- Interpret descriptive statistics for all measured dimensions
- Identify patterns in means, standard deviations, and distributions
- Note significant correlations and their strength
- Assess measurement quality using framework-appropriate validation:
  * For oppositional frameworks: Interpret negative correlations as validation (opposing constructs should be negatively correlated)
  * For unidimensional frameworks: Interpret traditional reliability metrics (Cronbach's Alpha)

## Level 2: Advanced Pattern Recognition  
- Analyze cross-dimensional relationships and interaction effects
- Identify statistical outliers and anomalous patterns
- Examine confidence patterns and analytical uncertainty
- Detect framework-specific insights from derived metrics

## Level 3: Cross-Dimensional Network Analysis
- Map dimensional clustering and meta-strategies
- Identify universal patterns across all cases
- Analyze tension patterns and strategic contradictions
- Assess variance decomposition and discriminatory power

## Level 4: Temporal and Archetypal Analysis
- Examine temporal progression patterns (when applicable)
- Identify rhetorical archetypes and speaker clustering
- Analyze normative layer gradients and trajectories
- Assess framework effectiveness and limitations

## Level 5: Meta-Analysis and Theoretical Integration
- Connect findings to relevant theoretical frameworks
- Identify methodological implications and innovations
- Generate testable hypotheses for future research
- Assess broader implications for the field

# REPORT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

## 0. Experiment Provenance Header (REQUIRED FIRST)
Start every report with available experiment metadata:

```
# [Framework Name] Analysis Report

**Experiment**: [experiment_name]  
**Run ID**: [run_id]  
**Date**: [completion_date]  
**Framework**: [framework_filename]  
**Corpus**: [corpus_filename] ([document_count] documents)  

---
```

Use only metadata that is actually available in the experiment_metadata. This header enables traceability of results.

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
- Key findings with statistical support
- Primary insights and their significance
- Framework effectiveness assessment

# CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

## Evidence Integration Standards
- **Every major claim** must include both statistical evidence AND textual quotes
- **Attribution format**: 'As [Speaker] stated: "[exact quote]" (Source: [document_name])'
- **Substantial quotes**: Full sentences, not fragments
- **Quality check**: Every Results paragraph contains at least one direct quote

## Statistical Interpretation Standards
- **No calculations**: Interpret provided statistics as definitive facts
- **Verbatim Data Integrity**: You MUST use the exact numerical values for all statistics (means, correlations, etc.) as they appear in the `Complete Research Data` input. Do NOT round, truncate, or alter these numbers in any way. Present them with the same precision as provided.
- **Transparency**: State analytical approach clearly (descriptive vs. inferential)
- **Appropriate conclusions**: Draw strongest evidence-based conclusions possible
- **Uncertainty acknowledgment**: Note limitations while maximizing insights

## Framework Agnosticism Standards
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Work with any framework's dimensional structure
- **No assumptions**: Don't assume specific dimension names or relationships
- **Flexible analysis**: Adapt analytical depth to available data richness
- **Universal patterns**: Look for insights applicable across frameworks

## Academic Quality Standards
- **Publication-ready**: Suitable for peer-reviewed journal submission
- **Methodological rigor**: Clear methodology and limitation acknowledgment
- **Theoretical grounding**: Connect to relevant academic literature when possible
- **Reproducible insights**: Clear connection from data through analysis to conclusions
- **Cautious Tone & Claim Strength**: Maintain a neutral, objective, and academic tone. Avoid promotional language, superlatives, and grandiose claims (e.g., "powerful," "profound," "demonstrates conclusively"). The strength of all claims must be proportional to the evidence, especially when dealing with small sample sizes or pilot studies. State findings factually and let the data speak for itself.
