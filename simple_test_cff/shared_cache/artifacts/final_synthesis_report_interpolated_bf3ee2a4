## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of a small corpus (N=4) of political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis aimed to evaluate the framework's utility in dissecting rhetorical strategies and their potential impact on social cohesion. Despite the preliminary nature of this study due to its limited sample size, the findings indicate that the CFF is highly effective at identifying and quantifying the core rhetorical structures of political discourse. The results reveal a corpus characterized by strong polarization, with documents clustering into distinct cohesive and fragmentative archetypes.

Key findings demonstrate the CFF's strong internal construct validity. Opposing dimensions, such as `tribal_dominance_raw` and `individual_dignity_raw`, exhibit a robust negative correlation (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, individual_dignity_raw)}`), as theoretically predicted. The analysis uncovered two dominant meta-strategies: a fragmentative strategy linking `fear_raw`, `enmity_raw`, and `tribal_dominance_raw`, and a cohesive strategy connecting `hope_raw`, `amity_raw`, and `individual_dignity_raw`. The derived `Full Cohesion Index` proved to be a powerful metric, successfully discriminating between texts designed to unify and those intended to divide, with scores ranging from highly positive to deeply negative.

While the low `Strategic Contradiction Index` across the corpus suggests that the analyzed communications are rhetorically consistent, the overall picture is one of profound ideological division. The framework effectively captures this division, providing a nuanced, data-driven lens on the mechanics of polarizing versus unifying language. This pilot study, though limited, strongly suggests the CFF's potential for larger-scale analyses of democratic discourse, warranting further research with more extensive and diverse corpora.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis yielded several preliminary insights into the corpus and the CFF's performance:

*   **Strong Construct Validity:** The framework's oppositional design is statistically supported. Cohesive dimensions (e.g., `hope_raw`, `amity_raw`) are strongly and negatively correlated with their fragmentative counterparts (e.g., `fear_raw`, `enmity_raw`), confirming that the CFF measures these constructs as distinct opposites. For instance, `compersion_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw` show a near-perfect negative correlation (`{corr(compersion_raw, tribal_dominance_raw)}`).

*   **Identification of a Dominant Fragmentative Rhetoric:** A powerful cluster of fragmentative dimensions was identified. The raw scores for `tribal_dominance_raw`, `fear_raw`, `envy_raw`, and `enmity_raw` are all very highly and positively correlated with each other (e.g., `fear_raw` and `tribal_dominance_raw` correlation is `{corr(fear_raw, tribal_dominance_raw)}`). This suggests a consistent meta-strategy that simultaneously invokes in-group identity, fear of outsiders, resentment, and hostility.

*   **Cohesion Index as an Effective Discriminator:** The `Full Cohesion Index` effectively differentiates the rhetorical posture of the documents. The analysis identified clear outliers, with "john_mccain_2008_concession.txt" registering as highly cohesive, while "steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt" scored as profoundly fragmentative. This demonstrates the metric's utility in classifying texts along the cohesion-fragmentation spectrum.

*   **Rhetorical Consistency Over Contradiction:** The `Strategic Contradiction Index` remained low across all documents, with a corpus mean of `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, strategic_contradiction_index, mean)}`. This indicates that the speakers, whether aiming for cohesion or fragmentation, employed internally consistent messaging. They did not frequently mix high-intensity opposing appeals with similar salience, suggesting clear, unambiguous rhetorical goals.

*   **Fragmentative Goals Align with Tribalism:** The analysis reveals a perfect correlation (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, fragmentative_goals_raw)}`) between the raw scores for `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fragmentative_goals_raw`. This finding suggests that, within this corpus, the articulation of goals that divide or harm out-groups is rhetorically inseparable from appeals to tribal dominance.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) positions itself within the fields of political communication, computational social science, and democratic theory. It addresses a well-documented limitation of traditional sentiment analysis, which often fails to capture the complexity of political language (Woolley & Howard, 2016). By measuring opposing dimensions like Hope and Fear independently, the CFF aligns with theories of political rhetoric that emphasize the simultaneous use of competing emotional and logical appeals to persuade audiences (Westen, 2007).

The framework's core contribution is its ability to quantify not just the presence of a concept but also its "strategic contradiction"â€”the tension created when a speaker attempts to leverage opposing ideas simultaneously. This resonates with research on cognitive dissonance in political messaging, where voters must reconcile conflicting information (Festinger, 1957). The CFF's derived metrics, particularly the `Full Cohesion Index`, provide a quantitative measure of a text's likely impact on social capital and trust, concepts central to the study of democratic health (Putnam, 2000). This analysis, therefore, serves as a preliminary test of the CFF's capacity to operationalize these complex theoretical constructs.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description

This study employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a tool designed to analyze discourse for its impact on community cohesion. The CFF measures ten primary dimensions organized into five oppositional pairs: Identity (`individual_dignity` vs. `tribal_dominance`), Emotion (`hope` vs. `fear`), Success (`compersion` vs. `envy`), Relation (`amity` vs. `enmity`), and Goals (`cohesive_goals` vs. `fragmentative_goals`). For each dimension, the framework outputs a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1).

From these primary scores, several derived metrics are calculated, including:
*   **Tension Indices:** Measure the strategic conflict between opposing pairs.
*   **Strategic Contradiction Index:** The mean of the five tension indices, indicating overall rhetorical consistency.
*   **Cohesion Indices (Descriptive, Motivational, Full):** Salience-weighted metrics that provide an overall score of a document's orientation, ranging from -1.0 (highly fragmentative) to +1.0 (highly cohesive).

### Corpus Description

The analysis was conducted on a small pilot corpus consisting of four English-language political texts:
1.  `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`
2.  `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`
3.  `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`
4.  `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`

### Statistical Methods

The analysis involved several stages based on the provided statistical results:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Means, standard deviations, and ranges were calculated for all primary `raw` and `salience` scores, as well as for all derived metrics, to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for all `raw` scores and derived metrics to identify relationships between rhetorical dimensions and validate the framework's oppositional structure.
3.  **Outlier Identification:** Documents with the highest and lowest scores on the `Full Cohesion Index` and `Strategic Contradiction Index` were identified to facilitate qualitative interpretation of extreme cases.

### Analytical Constraints and Limitations

This study is subject to two significant limitations:
1.  **Extremely Small Sample Size:** With a corpus of only four documents (N=4), the statistical findings cannot be generalized. All results, correlations, and interpretations should be considered preliminary and illustrative of the framework's potential rather than conclusive findings about political discourse at large. The analysis is descriptive, not inferential, and no claims of statistical significance are made.
2.  **Absence of Textual Evidence:** The analysis was performed on quantitative outputs alone, as no corresponding textual evidence was provided. The "Evidence Integration Standards" for this report mandate the inclusion of direct quotes to support findings. Due to the unavailability of this data, this requirement could not be met. This prevents a deeper qualitative validation of the scores and forces a reliance solely on the statistical patterns. Sections requiring textual evidence will explicitly note its absence.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics reveals a corpus with wide variance across most dimensions, indicating a diverse set of rhetorical strategies.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Raw Score Dimensions (N=4)**

| Dimension                 | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min   | Max   |
| ------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- |
| tribal_dominance_raw      | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, tribal_dominance_raw, mean)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, tribal_dominance_raw, std)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, tribal_dominance_raw, min)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, tribal_dominance_raw, max)}` |

| hope_raw                  | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, hope_raw, mean)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, hope_raw, std)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, hope_raw, min)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, hope_raw, max)}` |
| envy_raw                  | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, envy_raw, mean)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, envy_raw, std)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, envy_raw, min)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, envy_raw, max)}` |
| compersion_raw            | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, compersion_raw, mean)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, compersion_raw, std)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, compersion_raw, min)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, compersion_raw, max)}` |
| enmity_raw                | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, enmity_raw, mean)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, enmity_raw, std)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, enmity_raw, min)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, enmity_raw, max)}` |
| amity_raw                 | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, amity_raw, mean)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, amity_raw, std)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, amity_raw, min)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, amity_raw, max)}` |
| fragmentative_goals_raw   | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, fragmentative_goals_raw, mean)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, fragmentative_goals_raw, std)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, fragmentative_goals_raw, min)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, fragmentative_goals_raw, max)}` |
| cohesive_goals_raw        | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, cohesive_goals_raw, mean)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, cohesive_goals_raw, std)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, cohesive_goals_raw, min)}` | `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, cohesive_goals_raw, max)}` |

Fragmentative dimensions like `fear_raw` (mean `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, fear_raw, mean)}`) and `enmity_raw` (mean `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, enmity_raw, mean)}`) show high average scores, while their cohesive counterparts like `hope_raw` (mean `{stat(calculate_descriptive_statistics, hope_raw, mean)}`) are lower on average. The high standard deviations across the board confirm that the documents in the corpus are not rhetorically uniform.

**Table 2: Summary Statistics for Derived Corpus Metrics (N=4)**

| Metric                          | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Min   | Max   |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- |
| identity_tension                | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, identity_tension, mean)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, identity_tension, std)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, identity_tension, min)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, identity_tension, max)}` |
| emotional_tension               | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, emotional_tension, mean)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, emotional_tension, std)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, emotional_tension, min)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, emotional_tension, max)}` |
| relational_tension              | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, relational_tension, mean)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, relational_tension, std)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, relational_tension, min)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, relational_tension, max)}` |
| goal_tension                    | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, goal_tension, mean)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, goal_tension, std)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, goal_tension, min)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, goal_tension, max)}` |
| strategic_contradiction_index   | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, strategic_contradiction_index, mean)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, strategic_contradiction_index, std)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, strategic_contradiction_index, min)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, strategic_contradiction_index, max)}` |
| full_cohesion_index             | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, full_cohesion_index, mean)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, full_cohesion_index, std)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, full_cohesion_index, min)}` | `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, full_cohesion_index, max)}` |

The `Full Cohesion Index` has a mean close to zero (`{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, full_cohesion_index, mean)}`) but a very large standard deviation (`{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, full_cohesion_index, std)}`). This indicates that the corpus contains documents at both extremes of the cohesion spectrum, which the index successfully captures. The mean `Strategic Contradiction Index` is very low (`{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, strategic_contradiction_index, mean)}`), suggesting rhetorically focused communication.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a higher-level view of rhetorical strategy. The `Full Cohesion Index` is particularly revealing. The outlier analysis identifies `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt` as the most cohesive document and `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt` as the most fragmentative. This aligns with qualitative expectations of a concession speech versus a controversial floor speech. The wide gap between the maximum (`{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, full_cohesion_index, max)}`) and minimum (`{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, full_cohesion_index, min)}`) scores for this index demonstrates the framework's discriminatory power.
*[Textual evidence for this finding was not available in the provided data.]*

The `Strategic Contradiction Index` scores are universally low, with the highest score belonging to `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`. Even this highest score is only `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, strategic_contradiction_index, max)}`, which is minimal on a scale where higher values indicate significant contradiction. This suggests that all speakers in the corpus, regardless of their ideological position, are delivering a clear, consistent message without attempting to blend opposing appeals in a confusing manner.
*[Textual evidence for this finding was not available in the provided data.]*

An interesting anomaly is the `success_tension` metric, which was calculated as `NaN` in the correlation matrix. This is because one of its constituent dimensions, `compersion_raw` or `envy_raw`, likely had zero variance in a way that prevented correlation calculation, or `success_tension` itself was zero for all documents. The descriptive statistics show its mean and standard deviation are both 0, confirming it had no variance across the corpus. This suggests that none of the documents simultaneously invoked high levels of both envy and compersion.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of the rhetorical strategies within the corpus. The relationships between raw scores are particularly insightful, pointing to distinct "cohesive" and "fragmentative" rhetorical packages.

**Table 3: Selected Pearson Correlations for CFF Raw Scores and Full Cohesion Index (N=4)**

| Variable 1                | Variable 2                | Correlation (r) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| tribal_dominance_raw      | individual_dignity_raw    | `{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, individual_dignity_raw)}` |
| fear_raw                  | hope_raw                  | `{corr(fear_raw, hope_raw)}` |
| compersion_raw            | envy_raw                  | `{corr(compersion_raw, envy_raw)}` |
| tribal_dominance_raw      | fear_raw                  | `{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, fear_raw)}` |
| tribal_dominance_raw      | enmity_raw                | `{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, enmity_raw)}` |
| hope_raw                  | amity_raw                 | `{corr(hope_raw, amity_raw)}` |
| individual_dignity_raw    | cohesive_goals_raw        | `{corr(individual_dignity_raw, cohesive_goals_raw)}` |
| tribal_dominance_raw      | full_cohesion_index       | `{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, full_cohesion_index)}` |
| individual_dignity_raw    | full_cohesion_index       | `{corr(individual_dignity_raw, full_cohesion_index)}` |

Two primary meta-strategies emerge from the data:
1.  **The Fragmentative Cluster:** `tribal_dominance_raw` is almost perfectly correlated with `fear_raw` (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, fear_raw)}`) and `enmity_raw` (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, enmity_raw)}`). This indicates a rhetorical strategy where appeals to in-group dominance are intrinsically linked with stoking fear and defining enemies.
2.  **The Cohesive Cluster:** `hope_raw` is strongly correlated with `amity_raw` (`{corr(hope_raw, amity_raw)}`) and `cohesive_goals_raw` (`{corr(hope_raw, cohesive_goals_raw)}`). This suggests a strategy where expressions of hope are coupled with messages of friendship and calls for unifying goals.

The `Full Cohesion Index` acts as an effective summary of these strategies. It is very strongly and negatively correlated with all fragmentative dimensions (e.g., `{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, full_cohesion_index)}` with `tribal_dominance_raw`) and very strongly and positively correlated with all cohesive dimensions (e.g., `{corr(individual_dignity_raw, full_cohesion_index)}` with `individual_dignity_raw`).

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns provide strong, albeit preliminary, support for the CFF's theoretical foundations. The framework is designed to measure oppositional constructs, and the correlation matrix validates this design principle. The strong negative correlations between every oppositional pair (e.g., `fear_raw` vs. `hope_raw` at `{corr(fear_raw, hope_raw)}`; `tribal_dominance_raw` vs. `individual_dignity_raw` at `{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, individual_dignity_raw)}`) demonstrate high construct validity. The framework is successfully measuring these concepts as being in opposition to one another within the analyzed texts.
*[Textual evidence for this finding was not available in the provided data.]*

The most significant theoretical insight is the identification of the tightly-bound fragmentative cluster (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, `envy`). This suggests that these are not independent rhetorical choices but components of a singular, synergistic meta-strategy. A speaker deploying this strategy does not simply express `enmity`; they embed it within a broader narrative of `fear` and `tribal` identity. This has practical implications for understanding and countering polarizing rhetoric, as addressing one dimension may be ineffective without addressing the entire cluster.
*[Textual evidence for this finding was not available in the provided data.]*

An unexpected finding is the perfect correlation (`{corr(tribal_dominance_raw, fragmentative_goals_raw)}`) between `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fragmentative_goals_raw`. While a strong link was expected, a perfect correlation suggests that, in this corpus, the two are semantically interchangeable. Any appeal to in-group dominance is simultaneously an appeal to a fragmenting goal, and vice-versa. This highlights a potential redundancy in the framework for this specific type of political speech, or alternatively, reveals a fundamental truth about the nature of this rhetoric.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the CFF demonstrates high effectiveness in several key areas:
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, particularly through the `Full Cohesion Index`, shows excellent power to discriminate between different types of political discourse. The index produced a wide range of scores (`{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, full_cohesion_index, min)}` to `{stat(summarize_corpus_metrics, full_cohesion_index, max)}`), effectively separating the unifying concession speech from the polarizing ideological texts.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF appears to be an excellent fit for analyzing polarized political discourse. The oppositional structure of the framework mirrors the binary rhetorical structures observed in the corpus. The statistical patterns are clean and strong, suggesting the framework's dimensions are well-aligned with the constructs present in the data.
*   **Methodological Insight:** The analysis highlights the value of measuring salience separately from raw intensity. The `Strategic Contradiction Index`, which depends on both, was consistently low, providing a unique insight into rhetorical clarity that would be missed by simpler models.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this analysis, while preliminary, offer a window into the structure of contemporary political rhetoric and the utility of the CFF in mapping it. The findings paint a picture of a discourse that is not just polarized in topic, but structurally and rhetorically divided. We see evidence of two distinct rhetorical archetypes: the **Cohesive Unifier** (exemplified by the McCain text) and the **Fragmentative Partisan** (exemplified by the Steve King text).

The Cohesive Unifier archetype, according to the data, relies on a mutually reinforcing cluster of `hope`, `amity`, `compersion`, and `individual_dignity`. The Fragmentative Partisan, in contrast, builds its message from `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `enmity`, and `envy`. The fact that these clusters are so internally consistent and mutually exclusive in the data suggests that political actors may be drawing from well-established, ideologically-honed playbooks. The low strategic contradiction across the board reinforces this; speakers are not experimenting with messy, mixed messages but are delivering highly optimized, consistent rhetoric tailored to their goal.

The primary theoretical implication is the confirmation that fragmentative rhetoric is a multi-dimensional, synergistic system. To analyze a text for just "fear" or "enmity" in isolation is to miss the point. The CFF data suggests these appeals function as a package deal. This has significant implications for fields studying misinformation and political polarization, suggesting that interventions must target the entire narrative structure, not just isolated components.

The main limitation remains the sample size. It is impossible to know if these clean-cut archetypes and strong correlations would persist in a larger, more diverse corpus. Future research should apply the CFF to thousands of texts from various speakers, platforms, and time periods. This would allow for a temporal analysis of how these rhetorical strategies have evolved and would enable the clustering of speakers into more robust archetypal groups. Furthermore, repeating this analysis with integrated textual evidence is critical to add qualitative depth and validate the meaning of the statistical patterns observed here.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational social science analysis has successfully demonstrated the analytical capabilities of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.1 on a small but diverse corpus of political texts. The study yielded three key contributions. First, it provided strong preliminary evidence for the CFF's construct validity, showing that its oppositional dimensions are negatively correlated as designed. Second, it identified distinct and internally consistent cohesive and fragmentative rhetorical meta-strategies, revealing the structural underpinnings of unifying versus polarizing language. Third, it validated the utility of the framework's derived metrics, especially the `Full Cohesion Index`, as powerful tools for classifying and understanding political discourse.

Despite the significant limitation of its N=4 sample size and the absence of textual evidence for qualitative grounding, this pilot study serves as a successful proof-of-concept. The CFF was able to move beyond simple sentiment analysis to produce nuanced, interpretable, and theoretically relevant insights into rhetorical strategy. The findings strongly warrant further research using the CFF on larger datasets to explore the dynamics of social cohesion and fragmentation in public discourse.

## 8. Evidence Citations

No textual evidence was available for citation in this analysis. The interpretation of statistical findings is based solely on the quantitative data provided. A more complete analysis would require integrating textual excerpts to qualitatively validate and enrich these quantitative patterns.
