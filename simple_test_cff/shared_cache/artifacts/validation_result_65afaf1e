    "The machine-readable appendix of the experiment file contains a 'questions' key. This key is not defined in the v10.0 Experiment Specification standard. According to the standard, research questions must be defined in the human-readable portion of the document, not in the YAML appendix.",
    "The research question in the human-readable abstract ('What are the baseline cohesion and tension scores...') is different and less specific than the question defined in the (non-compliant) YAML appendix ('Will McCain's institutional discourse show higher cohesion than populist styles?'). This creates an internal inconsistency regarding the experiment's primary objective.",
    "The corpus contains only 4 documents. The primary research question requires a comparison between an 'institutional' style group (N=1) and a 'populist' style group (N=3). This sample size is too small for any statistically meaningful comparison and can only support a qualitative, comparative case study."
