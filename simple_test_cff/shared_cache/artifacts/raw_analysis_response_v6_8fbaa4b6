    "analysis_notes": "The analyzed document is a political speech with a clear populist, anti-oligarchy message. The rhetorical strategy is consistent and pronounced, involving the clear definition of an 'in-group' (the American people/working class) and an 'out-group' (the billionaire class/oligarchs). This made scoring dimensions related to conflict, such as Tribal Dominance, Envy, and Enmity, straightforward. The speech also employs a classic problem/solution structure, establishing a crisis (Fear) and then offering a unifying path forward (Hope, Amity, Cohesive Goals), leading to significant scores in these opposing dimensions. The salience scores often reflect the structural importance of a theme (e.g., Hope as a concluding call to action) even if its overall intensity throughout the text is moderate."
