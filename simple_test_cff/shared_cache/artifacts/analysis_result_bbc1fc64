This makes the dimensions of Tribal Dominance, Envy, and Enmity particularly intense and salient. The corresponding cohesive dimensions, like Amity and Cohesive Goals, are also strong but are framed specifically for the in-group ('working people') as a necessary response to the threat from the out-group ('oligarchs'). The rhetoric is explicit, providing clear evidence for most dimensions. The 'Compersion' dimension is entirely absent, as the speech's logic is built on combating illegitimate success, not celebrating success.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"tribal_dominance\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"individual_dignity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.6,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"fear\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"hope\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.4,\n          \"salience\": 0.3,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"envy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"compersion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"enmity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"amity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"fragmentative_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"cohesive_goals\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"tribal_dominance\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"We are witnessing an oligarchy in America.
