## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of four documents from the Democratic Discourse Corpus (2008-2025) using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis reveals starkly divergent rhetorical strategies, highlighting the framework's capacity to move beyond simple sentiment analysis and capture nuanced patterns of social cohesion and fragmentation. The findings indicate a significant distinction between institutional and populist rhetorical styles within this limited sample. John McCain's 2008 concession speech emerges as a strong outlier, characterized by exceptionally high cohesion (*Full Cohesion Index* = 0.84) and minimal strategic contradiction. In contrast, speeches by Steve King, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez exhibit negative cohesion scores (-0.74, -0.37, and -0.17, respectively), indicating a primary reliance on fragmentative language.

The analysis further identifies two dominant, internally consistent rhetorical meta-strategies. A "fragmentative syndrome" links appeals to Tribal Dominance, Fear, Envy, and Enmity, which are strongly inter-correlated (*r* > 0.85). Conversely, a "cohesive syndrome" connects appeals to Individual Dignity, Hope, Amity, and Cohesive Goals. The CFF's derived metrics proved particularly insightful; the *Strategic Contradiction Index* identified Bernie Sanders' speech as the most rhetorically complex (0.10), simultaneously employing competing cohesive and fragmentative appeals.

While the small sample size (N=4) necessitates that these findings be considered preliminary and descriptive, the analysis effectively demonstrates the CFF's utility. The framework successfully discriminated between documents, its oppositional dimensions were validated by strong negative correlations, and its derived metrics provided novel insights into rhetorical strategy. These results suggest the CFF is a promising tool for examining the linguistic underpinnings of political polarization and democratic health, warranting further research with larger, more diverse corpora.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of the Democratic Discourse Corpus using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) yielded several key insights into the rhetorical construction of political messaging. The following points represent the most significant preliminary findings:

*   **A Clear Divide in Cohesive Rhetoric:** The corpus is sharply divided between highly cohesive and highly fragmentative discourse. John McCainâ€™s 2008 speech stands alone with a strongly positive *Full Cohesion Index* (*FCI* = 0.84), while the other three populist-oriented speeches by Steve King, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez all registered negative scores (*FCI* = -0.74, -0.37, and -0.17, respectively), indicating a primary reliance on divisive language.

*   **Identification of a "Fragmentative Populist" Archetype:** The speeches by King, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez, despite ideological differences, share a rhetorical profile characterized by high scores in fragmentative dimensions like Tribal Dominance, Fear, and Enmity. This suggests a common rhetorical strategy in populist messaging that emphasizes in-group/out-group dynamics and threat narratives. For instance, Steve King's speech warns that American identity "would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), a clear appeal to fragmentative goals.

*   **Strategic Contradiction as a Measure of Rhetorical Complexity:** The *Strategic Contradiction Index*, a novel metric in the CFF, successfully identified nuanced rhetorical strategies. Bernie Sanders' speech registered the highest contradiction score (0.10), indicating a complex message that simultaneously leverages high-intensity appeals to both cohesive values (like Amity) and fragmentative emotions (like Enmity and Fear). This complexity is lost in traditional bipolar analyses.

*   **Strong Validation of the CFF's Oppositional Structure:** The analysis provides strong support for the CFF's design, which measures opposing concepts independently. Across the corpus, cohesive dimensions were strongly and negatively correlated with their fragmentative counterparts (e.g., *Compersion Salience* vs. *Tribal Dominance Salience*, *r* = -1.00). This confirms that the framework's dimensions are capturing genuinely oppositional rhetorical constructs.

*   **Evidence of Coherent Rhetorical "Syndromes":** The data reveals two distinct and internally consistent meta-strategies. A fragmentative syndrome shows that appeals to *Fear*, *Enmity*, *Tribal Dominance*, and *Envy* are highly inter-correlated (*r* > 0.85). A cohesive syndrome shows a similar tight clustering of *Individual Dignity*, *Hope*, *Amity*, and *Cohesive Goals*. This suggests that speakers tend to deploy these appeals as integrated rhetorical packages rather than in isolation.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed to analyze political and social discourse. The CFF assesses texts along five oppositional axes, each comprising a cohesive and a fragmentative dimension:
1.  **Identity:** Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance
2.  **Emotion:** Hope vs. Fear
3.  **Success:** Compersion (joy in others' success) vs. Envy
4.  **Relation:** Amity vs. Enmity
5.  **Goal:** Cohesive Goals vs. Fragmentative Goals

A key feature of the CFF is its independent scoring of each of the ten dimensions for both raw intensity (0-1 scale) and salience (0-1 scale). This allows for the analysis of complex rhetoric that may employ competing appeals simultaneously. From these base scores, several derived metrics are calculated, including Tension Indices, a *Strategic Contradiction Index* (the mean of tension indices), and three composite *Cohesion Indices* (Descriptive, Motivational, and Full) that provide an overall measure of a text's orientation toward social cohesion.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was conducted on the **Democratic Discourse Corpus**, a small, targeted collection of four documents spanning from 2008 to 2025. The corpus includes:
*   **john_mccain_2008_concession.txt**: An institutional speech by a Republican.
*   **steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt**: A populist conservative speech by a Republican.
*   **bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt**: A populist progressive speech by an Independent.
*   **alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt**: A populist progressive speech by a Democrat.

The data for each document consists of raw scores, salience scores, and confidence scores for the ten CFF dimensions, which were then used to calculate the derived metrics for this report.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational, appropriate for the pilot nature of this study. The methods included:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of means, standard deviations, and ranges for all base and derived metrics to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for all raw and salience scores to identify relationships between rhetorical dimensions and validate the framework's structure.
3.  **Derived Metric Analysis:** Interpretation of the *Full Cohesion Index* and *Strategic Contradiction Index* to identify overarching rhetorical strategies and complexities.

**Limitations:** The most significant limitation of this study is the extremely small sample size (N=4). Consequently, the findings are presented as preliminary, indicative, and descriptive of this specific corpus. No inferential claims can be made, and the results are not generalizable to broader political discourse. The analysis serves as a proof-of-concept for the CFF's analytical capabilities rather than a definitive statement on political rhetoric. Furthermore, speaker analysis was not possible as the required manifest file was not available.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An analysis of the corpus reveals wide variance in the use of cohesive and fragmentative rhetoric. The mean for the *Full Cohesion Index* across all four documents is negative (*M* = -0.11, *SD* = 0.67), indicating that, on average, the discourse in this small sample is more fragmentative than cohesive. This is driven by high average raw scores for fragmentative dimensions like *Envy* (*M* = 0.63, *SD* = 0.43), *Enmity* (*M* = 0.63, *SD* = 0.42), and *Fear* (*M* = 0.60, *SD* = 0.36). The large standard deviations across nearly all metrics underscore the heterogeneity of the documents within the corpus.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key CFF Metrics (N=4)**

| Metric                            | Mean  | Std. Dev. | Minimum | Maximum |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Cohesive Dimensions (Raw)**     |       |           |         |         |
| Individual Dignity                | 0.48  | 0.38      | 0.10    | 0.80    |
| Hope                              | 0.43  | 0.38      | 0.10    | 0.80    |
| Compersion                        | 0.23  | 0.45      | 0.00    | 0.90    |
| Amity                             | 0.58  | 0.40      | 0.00    | 0.90    |
| Cohesive Goals                    | 0.60  | 0.36      | 0.10    | 0.90    |
| **Fragmentative Dimensions (Raw)**|       |           |         |         |
| Tribal Dominance                  | 0.56  | 0.39      | 0.00    | 0.85    |
| Fear                              | 0.60  | 0.36      | 0.10    | 0.90    |
| Envy                              | 0.63  | 0.43      | 0.00    | 0.90    |
| Enmity                            | 0.63  | 0.42      | 0.00    | 0.90    |
| Fragmentative Goals               | 0.58  | 0.39      | 0.00    | 0.80    |
| **Derived Indices**               |       |           |         |         |
| Strategic Contradiction Index     | 0.05  | 0.04      | 0.01    | 0.10    |
| Full Cohesion Index               | -0.11 | 0.67      | -0.74   | 0.84    |

*Note: All values are rounded to two decimal places.*

The data clearly shows that while the potential for cohesive rhetoric is present (e.g., *Cohesive Goals* *M* = 0.60), it is often matched or exceeded by fragmentative appeals. The McCain speech is a notable exception, acting as a positive outlier that pulls the means for cohesive dimensions upward.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived CFF metrics provide a deeper understanding of the rhetorical strategies at play. The *Full Cohesion Index (FCI)* and the *Strategic Contradiction Index (SCI)* are particularly revealing when viewed together.

**Table 2: Cohesion and Contradiction Scores by Document**

| Document                                           | Full Cohesion Index (FCI) | Strategic Contradiction Index (SCI) | Rhetorical Profile                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| john_mccain_2008_concession.txt                    | 0.84                      | 0.01                                | Coherently Cohesive                |
| steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt                    | -0.74                     | 0.04                                | Coherently Fragmentative           |
| alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt | -0.17                     | 0.04                                | Strategically Complex (Fragmentative) |
| bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt         | -0.37                     | 0.10                                | Highly Contradictory (Fragmentative) |

This analysis positions each document within a distinct rhetorical quadrant:
*   **John McCain (High Cohesion, Low Contradiction):** This profile represents a clear, unambiguous, and unifying message. The rhetoric is consistently aimed at fostering social cohesion.
*   **Steve King (Low Cohesion, Low Contradiction):** This profile is equally clear but in the opposite direction. It is a coherently fragmentative message, consistently deploying divisive appeals with minimal use of competing cohesive language. This is exemplified by statements focused on destruction, such as when he claims American principles "would be destroyed by another presidential appointment" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).
*   **Bernie Sanders (Low Cohesion, High Contradiction):** This is the most complex profile. The high *SCI* score (0.10) reveals a strategy that leverages intense, competing appeals. The speech scores high on fragmentative dimensions like *Enmity* and *Tribal Dominance* but also on cohesive ones like *Amity*. This suggests a populist strategy that defines a beloved in-group through its opposition to a vilified out-group, creating a message fraught with internal tension.
*   **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Low Cohesion, Moderate Contradiction):** This profile is also complex, blending fragmentative appeals (high *Envy*, *Enmity*) with cohesive ones (*Amity*, *Cohesive Goals*). The message is ultimately fragmentative (*FCI* = -0.17) but contains significant cohesive elements, such as the call for "class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix of all raw and salience scores reveals powerful structural patterns in the data, providing strong validation for the CFF's theoretical design and uncovering two dominant meta-strategies.

**Framework Construct Validity:** The analysis confirms the oppositional nature of the CFF's dimensions. Cohesive dimensions are consistently and strongly negatively correlated with their fragmentative counterparts. For example, the salience of *Tribal Dominance* has a perfect negative correlation with the salience of *Compersion* (*r* = -1.00). Similarly, *Individual Dignity* raw scores are strongly negatively correlated with *Tribal Dominance* raw scores (*r* = -0.78) and *Fear* raw scores (*r* = -0.82). This indicates that, within this corpus, as rhetoric emphasizing one increases, rhetoric emphasizing its opposite systematically decreases, validating the framework's core premise.

**Rhetorical Meta-Strategies (Clustering):** The correlation matrix shows that speakers do not deploy rhetorical appeals in isolation. Instead, two clear "syndromes" or meta-strategies emerge:

1.  **The Fragmentative Syndrome:** There are extremely high positive correlations among all fragmentative dimensions. For instance, *Tribal Dominance* raw score is almost perfectly correlated with *Fear* raw score (*r* = 0.996) and highly correlated with *Enmity* raw score (*r* = 0.97) and *Fragmentative Goals* raw score (*r* = 0.99). This suggests that appeals to in-group identity, threat, out-group hostility, and divisive goals are part of a single, integrated rhetorical package.
2.  **The Cohesive Syndrome:** A similar, though slightly less tight, clustering exists among cohesive dimensions. *Amity* raw score is almost perfectly correlated with *Cohesive Goals* raw score (*r* = 0.999) and highly correlated with *Individual Dignity* raw score (*r* = 0.85). This indicates that appeals to universal dignity, goodwill, and shared constructive goals are also deployed as a coherent set. This is reflected in language that ties goals to unity, as when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez frames her movement as being "not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns, when grounded in the textual data, reveal the practical application of these rhetorical strategies. The strongest correlations point to the underlying logic connecting different types of appeals.

The near-perfect correlation between *Amity* and *Cohesive Goals* (*r* = 0.999) is not just a statistical artifact; it reflects a rhetorical logic where the articulation of shared, positive goals is the primary vehicle for expressing goodwill and unity. Conversely, the powerful link between *Fear* and *Tribal Dominance* (*r* = 0.996) suggests that defining and defending an in-group is often accomplished by stoking fear of an external or internal threat.

Interestingly, the textual evidence sometimes reveals the limitations of a purely quantitative approach. Steve King's speech, for example, scores very low on *Individual Dignity* (*raw* = 0.10), aligning with its overall fragmentative profile. Yet, it contains a statement classified as promoting this very value: "That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). This highlights a key insight: a speaker can use the language of a cohesive value in service of a broader fragmentative argument. In this context, the appeal to equal treatment may be interpreted as applying only to a narrowly defined in-group, a nuance that the high *Tribal Dominance* score (*raw* = 0.85) helps to clarify. This demonstrates the power of the CFF in holding these competing signals in tension for a more holistic analysis.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the Cohesive Flourishing Framework demonstrates considerable effectiveness in several key areas.

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework proved highly capable of discriminating between different rhetorical styles. The *Full Cohesion Index* produced a wide range of scores (from -0.74 to +0.84), effectively separating the coherently cohesive speech from the fragmentative ones. This suggests the metrics are sensitive to meaningful variations in discourse.

*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF's dimensions and structure appear well-suited for analyzing modern political discourse. The strong correlational patterns and the emergence of clear rhetorical archetypes (Institutional Cohesive vs. Fragmentative Populist) indicate that the framework's concepts map effectively onto the strategies present in the corpus. The framework's ability to model populist rhetoric from both the right (King) and the left (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) is a notable strength.

*   **Methodological Innovation:** The *Strategic Contradiction Index* stands out as a significant methodological contribution. It successfully quantified the rhetorical complexity in the Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez speeches, a feature that would be obscured by simpler models. It provides a robust metric for identifying and analyzing sophisticated messaging that relies on holding opposing ideas in tension. For example, a speaker can appeal to a *Cohesive Goal* like upholding the constitution, as Steve King doesâ€”"We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt)â€”while simultaneously framing this goal within a narrative of threat and destruction, creating strategic contradiction.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this analysis, while preliminary, offer several important theoretical and practical implications. The stark contrast between John McCain's 2008 institutional rhetoric and the more recent populist speeches suggests a potential evolution in political communication styles, though this cannot be confirmed without a larger, diachronic corpus. The earlier speech is defined by its cohesive clarity, while the later speeches, regardless of ideology, are characterized by fragmentation and strategic complexity.

This study identifies two potential rhetorical archetypes worthy of further investigation:
1.  **The Institutional Unifier:** Characterized by low contradiction and high cohesion. This style, exemplified by McCain's concession, prioritizes civic norms, respect for opponents, and shared national identity.
2.  **The Populist Agitator:** Characterized by negative cohesion and often moderate-to-high contradiction. This style, seen in the speeches of King, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez, constructs a virtuous "people" (the in-group) and defines it against a corrupt "elite" or "other" (the out-group). This strategy inherently relies on fragmentative appeals like *Enmity*, *Fear*, and *Tribal Dominance* to build in-group solidarity. The higher contradiction scores in the progressive populist examples may suggest a strategy that attempts to blend universalist cohesive values with particularist fragmentative anger.

These findings lead to a testable hypothesis for future research: **Populist rhetoric, regardless of its position on the left-right spectrum, will consistently exhibit lower Cohesion Index scores and higher Strategic Contradiction Index scores than institutional political rhetoric.** Testing this hypothesis would require a much larger corpus balanced across rhetorical styles, time periods, and political ideologies.

The broader significance of this work lies in its demonstration of a computational method for moving beyond sentiment analysis to assess the democratic health of discourse. By measuring the specific linguistic mechanisms that build or erode social trust and solidarity, the CFF provides a tool for researchers, journalists, and citizens to better understand the forces shaping their political environment.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of four political speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework has successfully demonstrated the framework's capacity to extract nuanced and meaningful insights from complex discourse. The study identified a clear cleavage between cohesive-institutional and fragmentative-populist rhetorical strategies, validating the CFF's core dimensions and its discriminatory power. The discovery of coherent "cohesive" and "fragmentative" rhetorical syndromes, supported by strong correlational evidence, suggests that these appeals are deployed in predictable, strategic packages.

The framework's novel metrics, particularly the *Strategic Contradiction Index*, proved highly effective in revealing the sophisticated and often tense messaging inherent in modern populist communication. While the very small sample size (N=4) means these findings must be treated with caution, this pilot study serves as a robust proof-of-concept. It validates the CFF as a promising analytical tool and generates compelling, testable hypotheses about the structure of political rhetoric. Future research should apply this methodology to larger and more diverse corpora to confirm and expand upon these preliminary but significant results.
