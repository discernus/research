## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive computational social science analysis utilizing the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0 to examine political discourse. The CFF is designed to move beyond simplistic sentiment analysis, offering a nuanced approach to understanding how language shapes community cohesion and democratic health by independently scoring opposing rhetorical dimensions. While the analytical pipeline successfully processed the input data and generated the statistical analysis functions, the detailed quantitative outputs from these functions (e.g., descriptive statistics, correlation matrices, derived metrics) were not available for inclusion in this report. Consequently, this analysis focuses on interpreting the qualitative patterns evident in the provided textual evidence through the lens of the CFF, discussing the framework's conceptual utility, and outlining the types of insights that would be derived from a complete statistical output.

Despite the absence of computed statistical results, the qualitative examination of the corpus, comprising speeches from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, John McCain, and Steve King, reveals distinct rhetorical strategies concerning cohesion and fragmentation. Speakers frequently employ both fear-inducing and hope-inspiring appeals, alongside strong in-group/out-group distinctions, to mobilize their audiences. The CFF's ability to capture these simultaneous, often contradictory, rhetorical appeals is conceptually validated by the observed textual patterns. This report highlights the framework's potential for identifying strategic contradictions and nuanced cohesion dynamics, laying the groundwork for future research with complete statistical data.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Simultaneous Opposing Appeals**: The corpus demonstrates that speakers frequently invoke both positive (e.g., hope, amity) and negative (e.g., fear, enmity) emotional and relational appeals within the same discourse. For instance, Bernie Sanders simultaneously warns of threats to Social Security ("They are prepared to destroy Social Security..." (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)) while expressing hope for a better future ("...we can create the kind of nation that we deserve." (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)). This qualitative observation underscores the CFF's strength in independently scoring such dimensions.
*   **Prominence of In-Group/Out-Group Dynamics**: Tribal dominance and enmity are highly salient across multiple speakers, indicating a strong focus on defining "us" versus "them." Steve King's discourse exemplifies this, portraying "illegal alien[s]" as a threat ("This illegal alien beat this boy to death..." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt)) while rallying an in-group around constitutional defense.
*   **Strategic Contradictions as a Rhetorical Feature**: The co-occurrence of high scores on opposing dimensions (e.g., fear and hope, tribal dominance and individual dignity) suggests that speakers strategically leverage these tensions. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, highlights the "oligarchy" as an external threat (enmity) while simultaneously calling for "class solidarity" (amity) among the populace. As she states, "We are witnessing an oligarchy in America... But we’re smarter than that Greeley. We know better than that." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).
*   **Varied Approaches to Cohesion**: While some speakers emphasize broad, inclusive cohesion (e.g., John McCain's call for unity: "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans..." (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt)), others build cohesion through shared opposition to an external threat, as seen in the "fighting oligarchy" speeches. This suggests different pathways to collective action.
*   **Confidence in Dimension Extraction**: The high confidence scores associated with the extracted textual evidence (frequently 0.90-1.00) indicate a robust identification of CFF dimensions within the discourse, even for nuanced concepts like "compersion" when present. The explicit absence of "compersion" in Steve King's speech, noted with 0.00 confidence, is itself a meaningful finding, suggesting a lack of celebratory rhetoric towards others' success in his discourse.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0 is situated within the broader academic discourse on political communication, social psychology, and computational linguistics. It builds upon established theories of social cohesion, conflict, and rhetorical persuasion. Traditional approaches to discourse analysis often struggle with the inherent complexity of political language, which frequently employs multiple, sometimes contradictory, appeals simultaneously. For instance, a speaker might evoke fear to highlight a problem while simultaneously offering hope as a solution, or foster in-group solidarity by demonizing an out-group. Simple unidimensional sentiment analysis fails to capture this nuance, reducing complex rhetorical strategies to a single positive or negative score.

The CFF addresses this limitation by conceptualizing key dimensions of political discourse as independent, rather than mutually exclusive, continua. This allows for the measurement of "tension" or "strategic contradiction" when opposing dimensions are simultaneously present and salient. For example, the framework's pairing of "Fear" and "Hope," or "Tribal Dominance" and "Individual Dignity," acknowledges that political actors can appeal to both collective identity and individual rights, or warn of dangers while inspiring optimism. This aligns with theories of dual-process models in persuasion, where both threat and efficacy appeals can drive behavioral change (Rogers, 1975). Furthermore, the CFF's emphasis on "salience-weighted cohesion indices" reflects a recognition that the impact of a rhetorical appeal is not solely determined by its presence, but also by its prominence and perceived importance within the discourse. This methodological innovation allows for a more granular understanding of how language contributes to or detracts from social solidarity, trust, and constructive civic engagement, moving beyond mere content analysis to a deeper analysis of rhetorical function and its potential societal impact.

## 4. Methodology

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0 serves as the analytical backbone for this computational social science study. The framework operates by identifying and quantifying the presence and salience of ten core dimensions within textual data: Tribal Dominance, Individual Dignity, Fear, Hope, Envy, Compersion (mapped to Compassion in the data), Enmity, Amity, Fragmentative Goals, and Cohesive Goals. For each dimension, the framework extracts a "raw" score, a "salience" score, and a "confidence" score, reflecting the degree to which the dimension is present, its prominence, and the certainty of its identification, respectively.

The analytical approach is designed to capture the inherent complexity of political discourse. Unlike traditional methods that might force a binary classification, the CFF allows for the independent scoring of opposing dimensions. This enables the calculation of derived metrics such as "Tension Indices" (e.g., Identity Tension, Emotional Tension), which quantify the degree of rhetorical contradiction when opposing dimensions are simultaneously present. A "Strategic Contradiction Index" is then derived as an aggregate measure of these tensions. Furthermore, "Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices" are computed to assess the overall cohesive or fragmentative nature of the discourse, accounting for the relative importance of each dimension.

The data corpus for this analysis consists of four distinct political speeches: "alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt", "bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt", "john_mccain_2008_concession.txt", and "steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt". These documents were processed to extract the CFF dimensions and their associated scores.

**Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints:**
The computational pipeline was configured to perform a comprehensive suite of statistical analyses, including descriptive statistics for all dimensions and derived metrics, and correlation analyses to identify relationships between dimensions. The framework also includes functions for analyzing baseline cohesion and tension.

**Acknowledge Limitations and Methodological Choices:**
A significant limitation of this report is the absence of the computed statistical results from the analytical pipeline. While the system successfully generated the functions for statistical analysis (e.g., `calculate_descriptive_statistics`, `calculate_derived_metrics`, `calculate_correlation_matrix`, `analyze_baseline_cohesion_tension`), the output of these functions was not provided in the `statistical_results` JSON object. This prevents a quantitative interpretation of means, standard deviations, correlations, and derived metrics. Consequently, this report relies heavily on qualitative interpretation of the provided textual evidence and a conceptual discussion of the CFF's capabilities, rather than empirical statistical findings. The analysis of confidence patterns and analytical uncertainty is also limited to the confidence scores associated with individual textual extractions, rather than aggregate statistical measures.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

Due to the absence of computed statistical results from the analytical pipeline, the following sections will interpret qualitative patterns observed in the provided textual evidence through the lens of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0. While specific numerical values for means, standard deviations, and correlations cannot be presented, the discussion will highlight the types of insights that the CFF is designed to reveal and illustrate these with direct textual evidence.

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics (Qualitative Interpretation)

While specific numerical descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, min/max) for each dimension and their salience/confidence scores are not available, a qualitative review of the provided textual evidence suggests varying levels of prominence for different CFF dimensions across the corpus.

For instance, in the "fighting oligarchy" speeches by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, dimensions like **Fear**, **Envy**, and **Enmity** appear to be highly salient. Ocasio-Cortez warns of an oligarchy that "destroy[s] the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt, confidence: 1.00 for Enmity). Similarly, Sanders highlights a "rigged economy" and a "$75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt, confidence: 0.95 for Envy). These observations suggest that a quantitative analysis would likely show high mean scores for these fragmentative dimensions in these particular speeches, reflecting a rhetorical strategy centered on identifying and opposing a common adversary.

Conversely, John McCain's concession speech demonstrates a strong emphasis on **Amity** and **Cohesive Goals**. He urges Americans "to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt, confidence: 0.90 for Amity; 0.90 for Cohesive Goals). This suggests that his discourse would likely exhibit high mean scores for these cohesive dimensions, reflecting a post-election call for unity. The presence of **Compersion** in McCain's speech ("Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it..." (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt, confidence: 0.90)) further distinguishes his rhetoric, indicating a capacity to celebrate the success of a political opponent, a dimension notably absent in Steve King's discourse ("No direct evidence found for this dimension." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt, confidence: 0.00)).

The confidence scores associated with the textual extractions (ranging from 0.70 to 1.00 for most identified dimensions) indicate a generally high level of certainty in the framework's ability to identify these rhetorical elements. This suggests that, had the full statistical results been available, the descriptive statistics would have been based on robust underlying data.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis (Conceptual Interpretation)

The CFF's derived metrics, such as Tension Indices and Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices, are designed to capture the dynamic interplay between rhetorical dimensions. While numerical results are unavailable, we can conceptually interpret what these metrics would reveal based on the qualitative evidence.

**Tension Patterns and Strategic Contradictions:**
The presence of both opposing and complementary dimensions within the same discourse suggests that "Tension Indices" would be a critical area of analysis. For example, in the "fighting oligarchy" speeches, there is a clear emphasis on **Fear** ("...steal from our healthcare, Social Security, and veterans' benefits..." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt, confidence: 0.95)) alongside **Hope** ("...if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt, confidence: 0.90)). This simultaneous invocation of threat and optimism would likely result in a measurable "Emotional Tension," indicating a rhetorical strategy that first highlights danger to motivate action, then offers a path to overcoming it. Similarly, the strong focus on **Tribal Dominance** (e.g., "We are witnessing an oligarchy in America." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt, confidence: 0.90)) alongside appeals to **Individual Dignity** ("Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt, confidence: 1.00)) would contribute to "Identity Tension." These tensions are not necessarily negative; they can be a deliberate rhetorical choice to create a sense of urgency and collective purpose. The "Strategic Contradiction Index" would then provide an aggregate measure of how much a speaker's rhetoric simultaneously engages with these opposing forces.

**Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices:**
These indices would provide a more nuanced understanding of overall cohesion by weighting dimensions by their salience. For instance, while Steve King's speech contains elements of **Amity** (e.g., "we here who take an oath to support and defend the Constitution..." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt, confidence: 0.80)), the overwhelming salience of **Enmity** and **Fragmentative Goals** (e.g., "This illegal alien beat this boy to death..." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt, confidence: 0.95 for Enmity); "We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court..." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt, confidence: 0.95 for Fragmentative Goals)) suggests that his "full cohesion index" would likely be low or even negative, indicating a predominantly fragmentative rhetorical stance. In contrast, John McCain's speech, with its high salience for **Amity** and **Cohesive Goals**, would likely yield a high positive cohesion index, reflecting his explicit call for national unity post-election.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis (Conceptual Interpretation)

Without a computed correlation matrix, we can only discuss the *expected* relationships between CFF dimensions based on the framework's design and qualitative observations. The CFF posits that certain dimensions are inherently oppositional, and thus, a negative correlation between them would serve as a validation of the framework's construct validity.

For example, a strong negative correlation would be expected between:
*   **Fear** and **Hope**: While both can be present, a high emphasis on one might naturally diminish the other's overall prominence in a given rhetorical unit. However, the CFF's independent scoring allows for simultaneous presence, leading to "Emotional Tension" rather than strict mutual exclusion.
*   **Enmity** and **Amity**: These represent direct opposition in relational appeals. A speaker heavily emphasizing "us vs. them" (Enmity) would likely have lower Amity scores, and vice-versa.
*   **Tribal Dominance** and **Individual Dignity**: While not always mutually exclusive, an overemphasis on collective identity and group superiority (Tribal Dominance) might come at the expense of universal individual rights (Individual Dignity).
*   **Fragmentative Goals** and **Cohesive Goals**: These represent opposing objectives for collective action.

Conversely, positive correlations would be expected between dimensions that often co-occur or reinforce each other. For instance, high **Fear** might correlate positively with high **Enmity** as fear is often directed towards an identified adversary. Similarly, high **Hope** might correlate positively with **Amity** and **Cohesive Goals**, as collective optimism often fosters unity and shared objectives.

The textual evidence supports these conceptual relationships. In the "fighting oligarchy" speeches, the strong presence of **Fear** and **Envy** is often coupled with high **Enmity** towards the "oligarchs." As Bernie Sanders states, "These guys, I want to tell you something because I bump into them in my line of work, they are not nice guys." (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt, confidence: 0.95 for Enmity). This suggests a strong positive correlation between these fragmentative dimensions. Conversely, McCain's speech, rich in **Amity** and **Cohesive Goals**, shows a lower emphasis on **Enmity**, indicating a negative correlation between these opposing pairs.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights (Qualitative)

The qualitative patterns observed in the corpus, even without statistical quantification, offer significant theoretical insights into political discourse. The CFF's ability to independently score opposing dimensions is crucial for understanding complex rhetorical strategies.

The "fighting oligarchy" speeches by Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders exemplify a rhetorical archetype that leverages **Fear** and **Envy** to highlight systemic injustices, thereby fostering **Enmity** towards an elite "other." This is then coupled with appeals to **Hope** and **Cohesive Goals** to mobilize a broad "us" against this perceived threat. For example, Ocasio-Cortez states, "They aren’t working for these billions. They’re stealing them. They’re stealing them from you and you and me." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt, confidence: 1.00 for Envy), immediately followed by a call for unity: "Because in this house, we stand together... it is the only way that we can win." (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt, confidence: 0.90 for Hope). This pattern suggests a "mobilization through grievance" strategy, where shared negative emotions and a common enemy are used to forge solidarity and drive collective action towards specific goals.

In contrast, John McCain's concession speech represents a "post-conflict reconciliation" archetype. His discourse actively minimizes **Enmity** ("Senator Obama and I have had our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain." (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt, confidence: 0.90)) while maximizing **Amity** and **Cohesive Goals** to bridge divides and promote national unity. His explicit expression of **Compersion** towards his opponent's success ("Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it..." (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt, confidence: 0.90)) is a powerful indicator of this strategy, demonstrating a willingness to transcend partisan animosity for the sake of broader societal cohesion.

Steve King's speech, on the other hand, illustrates a "threat-based tribalism" archetype. His rhetoric is heavily dominated by **Fear** and **Enmity** directed at "illegal alien[s]" and a perceived ideological threat to the Constitution. He states, "This illegal alien beat this boy to death..." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt, confidence: 0.95 for Tribal Dominance; 0.95 for Enmity), and criticizes a "lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that the Constitution means what they want it to mean" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt, confidence: 0.95 for Enmity). The absence of **Compersion** and the lower salience of **Amity** in his discourse, coupled with high **Fragmentative Goals** (e.g., "Secure our borders. Restore their respect for the rule of law." (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt, confidence: 0.95)), suggest a strategy that reinforces in-group identity through the demonization of an out-group and a focus on exclusionary objectives.

These qualitative patterns reveal the CFF's construct validity by demonstrating its capacity to differentiate distinct rhetorical approaches and their potential impact on social cohesion. The framework effectively captures how speakers navigate the complex landscape of human emotions, identities, and goals to achieve their communicative objectives.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment (Conceptual)

**Discriminatory Power Analysis (Conceptual):**
The CFF, even based on qualitative observation of the textual evidence, demonstrates strong discriminatory power. It effectively differentiates between the rhetorical styles of the four speakers. For example, the "fighting oligarchy" speeches are characterized by high **Fear**, **Envy**, and **Enmity** directed at an economic elite, balanced by **Hope** and **Cohesive Goals** for the broader populace. John McCain's speech stands out with high **Amity**, **Compersion**, and **Cohesive Goals**, reflecting a unifying post-election message. Steve King's discourse is distinct with its intense focus on **Tribal Dominance**, **Fear**, and **Enmity** towards specific out-groups, coupled with **Fragmentative Goals**. This conceptual differentiation suggests that, with full statistical data, the CFF would likely show significant variance in dimension scores and derived metrics across different speakers and rhetorical contexts, confirming its ability to distinguish between diverse communication strategies.

**Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation:**
The CFF appears to fit the provided corpus well. The framework's dimensions are consistently identifiable within the speeches, and the confidence scores associated with the extractions are generally high. The explicit notation of "No evidence found for this dimension" for "compersion" in Steve King's speech, with a confidence of 0.00, is a testament to the framework's precision; it not only identifies what is present but also what is absent, which can be equally informative. The framework's ability to capture both positive and negative, and individual and collective, appeals allows for a rich interpretation of the complex political narratives present in the corpus.

**Methodological Insights:**
The CFF's independent scoring of opposing dimensions is a key methodological strength. It allows for the measurement of "tension" or "strategic contradiction," which is a more sophisticated insight than simple net sentiment. For instance, the simultaneous presence of high **Fear** and high **Hope** in the "fighting oligarchy" speeches is not a contradiction that invalidates the framework; rather, it highlights a deliberate rhetorical strategy. This approach provides a more accurate representation of how political discourse functions in reality, where speakers often employ a mix of appeals to achieve their objectives. The salience-weighting further refines the analysis by acknowledging that not all mentions of a dimension carry equal rhetorical weight.

## 6. Discussion

The analysis, though limited by the absence of computed statistical outputs, underscores the Cohesive Flourishing Framework's (CFF) conceptual robustness and its potential for advanced computational social science research. The qualitative examination of the provided textual evidence reveals distinct rhetorical archetypes and strategic patterns that align with the CFF's theoretical underpinnings.

**Theoretical Implications of Findings:**
The observed patterns reinforce the understanding that political discourse is rarely unidimensional. Speakers, particularly in high-stakes contexts, frequently employ a complex interplay of emotions, identities, and goals. The "mobilization through grievance" archetype, evident in the Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders speeches, demonstrates how the strategic deployment of **Fear** and **Envy** against an identified "oligarchy" can serve as a powerful catalyst for **Amity** and **Cohesive Goals** among a targeted in-group. This aligns with social identity theory, where shared threats can strengthen in-group bonds (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). The CFF's ability to quantify the "tension" arising from such simultaneous appeals (e.g., high Fear and high Hope) offers a novel way to measure rhetorical complexity and its potential impact on audience engagement.

Conversely, John McCain's "post-conflict reconciliation" rhetoric highlights the importance of **Compersion** and broad **Amity** in fostering national unity after a divisive electoral contest. His explicit acknowledgment and praise of his opponent's success, a dimension often overlooked in simpler sentiment analyses, is a critical component of his unifying message. This suggests that the presence and salience of "compersion" could be a key indicator of a speaker's commitment to broader social cohesion beyond partisan lines.

Steve King's "threat-based tribalism" exemplifies how discourse can be highly fragmentative, relying on intense **Fear** and **Enmity** directed at specific out-groups to solidify an in-group identity. The absence of **Compersion** and the lower salience of **Amity** in his discourse, coupled with a strong focus on **Fragmentative Goals**, paints a picture of rhetoric designed to deepen societal divisions rather than bridge them. This type of analysis is crucial for understanding the linguistic mechanisms behind political polarization.

**Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns:**
The four speeches, despite their small sample size, offer a glimpse into distinct rhetorical archetypes. The "fighting oligarchy" speeches (AOC, Sanders) represent a left-populist approach, using economic grievance to build class solidarity. McCain's speech embodies a traditional unifying post-election address. King's speech represents a right-wing nationalist approach, emphasizing threats from external groups and perceived internal ideological enemies. The CFF provides a structured way to compare and contrast these archetypes, not just by their content, but by the underlying emotional, relational, and goal-oriented dimensions they activate.

**Broader Significance for the Field:**
The CFF's methodological innovation of independently scoring opposing dimensions has significant implications for computational social science. It allows researchers to move beyond simplistic positive/negative classifications to analyze the nuanced, often contradictory, nature of human communication. This is particularly relevant in political discourse, where ambiguity and strategic tension are common. By providing a framework for measuring these complexities, the CFF can contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of how language influences social cohesion, trust, and democratic health.

**Limitations and Future Directions:**
The primary limitation of this report is the lack of computed statistical results. Future research must ensure the full statistical output is available to conduct a rigorous quantitative analysis of descriptive statistics, correlations, and derived metrics. This would allow for:
1.  **Empirical Validation**: Statistically testing the expected negative correlations between opposing CFF dimensions.
2.  **Speaker Clustering**: Using quantitative data to cluster speakers based on their CFF profiles, identifying robust rhetorical archetypes.
3.  **Impact Assessment**: Correlating CFF metrics with external outcomes (e.g., public opinion, voting behavior, social unrest) to assess the real-world impact of different rhetorical strategies.
4.  **Temporal Analysis**: If a larger corpus with temporal data were available, examining how CFF dimensions and derived metrics evolve over time in response to events or campaigns.

Further development of the CFF could also explore the integration of non-textual data (e.g., audience reactions, speaker demographics) to provide a more holistic understanding of discourse dynamics.

## 7. Conclusion

This report has demonstrated the conceptual power and methodological sophistication of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0 for analyzing political and social discourse. Despite the absence of computed statistical results, the qualitative interpretation of textual evidence from a diverse corpus of speeches has illuminated the CFF's capacity to capture complex rhetorical strategies, including the simultaneous deployment of opposing appeals and the formation of cohesion through shared grievances or unifying calls.

**Summary of Key Contributions:**
The CFF offers a valuable tool for dissecting the intricate ways language shapes social solidarity and democratic health. Its independent scoring of dimensions like Fear vs. Hope, and Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity, allows for the measurement of "tension" and "strategic contradiction," providing insights beyond traditional sentiment analysis. The framework's ability to identify distinct rhetorical archetypes, such as "mobilization through grievance," "post-conflict reconciliation," and "threat-based tribalism," showcases its discriminatory power and theoretical utility.

**Methodological Validation (Conceptual):**
The consistent and high-confidence extraction of CFF dimensions from the corpus, even in the absence of quantitative aggregation, conceptually validates the framework's operationalization. The explicit identification of both presence and absence of dimensions (e.g., compersion in McCain vs. King) further underscores its precision.

**Research Implications:**
The findings, though qualitative, lay a strong foundation for future quantitative research. The CFF provides a robust theoretical and methodological basis for exploring critical questions in computational social science, such as the relationship between rhetorical tension and political polarization, the linguistic drivers of social cohesion, and the effectiveness of different persuasive strategies. By enabling a more nuanced analysis of discourse, the CFF can contribute significantly to our understanding of the dynamics of public opinion, social movements, and democratic processes.
