The rubric explicitly states to 'query the RAG index to find the corresponding value in the research data' for every statistical claim. However, the 'research data' provided is incomplete:\n\n1.  **Missing Aggregated Statistics:** The `statistical_results.json` and `derived_metrics_results.json` files contain only metadata about function generation, not the actual computed statistical results such as corpus-wide means, standard deviations, or correlation matrices. This prevents verification of all values presented in Table 1 (Descriptive Statistics) and Table 3 (Selected Pearson Correlations).\n2.  **Missing Individual Document Data:** The `individual_analysis_results.json` file provides raw and salience scores for only one of the four documents (`john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`).

This makes it impossible to verify any individual scores or derived metrics for these three documents, including those presented in Table 2 (Derived Metric Scores by Document) or specific claims about their raw scores (e.g., Sanders's `enmity_raw` and `amity_raw`).\n\nDue to this critical lack of necessary evidence, the vast majority of statistical claims in the report cannot be validated against the provided data. The only claims that could be verified were John McCain's raw scores for `amity` (0.90), `compersion` (0.90), and `individual_dignity` (0.80), which matched the provided `individual_analysis_results.json` for his document.",
