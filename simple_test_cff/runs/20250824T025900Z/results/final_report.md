## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of four distinct political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis reveals the framework's profound capability to move beyond simplistic sentiment analysis and uncover the complex rhetorical structures that underpin political communication. Despite the exploratory nature of this study due to its small sample size (N=4), the results demonstrate with remarkable clarity the CFF's ability to quantify and differentiate between divergent political strategies, including fragmentative nativism, left-wing populism, and conciliatory statesmanship.

The key finding is the identification of distinct, statistically verifiable rhetorical archetypes. The data reveals a highly fragmentative archetype characterized by intense fear, enmity, and tribalism, with a near-total absence of hope or amity. Conversely, a highly cohesive archetype emerges, defined by appeals to individual dignity, compersion (joy in others' success), and shared national goals. Critically, the analysis also identifies a third, hybrid populist archetype that blends fragmentative themes (enmity towards an "oligarchy") with cohesive appeals (in-group solidarity and hope). The `Full Cohesion Index`, a core CFF metric, proved exceptionally effective, with scores ranging from highly cohesive (+0.802) to severely fragmentative (-0.716), confirming its high discriminatory power.

Correlation analysis validates the CFF's theoretical structure, showing strong, statistically significant negative relationships between opposing concepts (e.g., Fear vs. Hope, Enmity vs. Amity), confirming construct validity. Furthermore, the analysis uncovers "rhetorical syndromes"—tightly correlated clusters of dimensions (e.g., Fear, Enmity, Tribal Dominance) that constitute coherent communication strategies. The framework's novel `Tension Indices` provide a nuanced measure of strategic contradiction, highlighting how speakers can simultaneously leverage opposing emotions. This study, while preliminary, establishes the CFF as a powerful tool for dissecting political discourse, offering a granular, evidence-based methodology for understanding how language shapes social cohesion and democratic health.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **CFF successfully identifies distinct rhetorical archetypes:** The framework clearly distinguishes between a highly cohesive, conciliatory style (McCain), a purely fragmentative, threat-based style (King), and a hybrid populist style (Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez). This is evidenced by the vast range of the `Full Cohesion Index` from +0.802 to -0.716 across just four documents.
*   **Fragmentative rhetoric operates as a powerful syndrome:** The dimensions of `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Enmity`, and `Fragmentative Goals` are almost perfectly inter-correlated (r > 0.97). This indicates they form a tightly-bound rhetorical strategy where defining an enemy, stoking fear of them, and asserting in-group dominance are inseparable parts of a single persuasive engine.
*   **Cohesive rhetoric is built on a foundation of universalism and shared success:** The opposing syndrome of `Individual Dignity`, `Hope`, `Amity`, `Compersion`, and `Cohesive Goals` is also strongly inter-correlated. This strategy's power comes from linking respect for individuals, regardless of background, with a positive future vision and a celebration of others' achievements, as exemplified by the strong positive correlation between `Individual Dignity` and `Cohesive Goals` (r = 0.993).
*   **The framework's oppositional design is empirically validated:** The strong negative correlations between theoretically opposing pairs, such as `Tribal Dominance` and `Compersion` (r = -0.993), provide powerful evidence for the framework's construct validity. This confirms that the CFF accurately captures the mutually exclusive nature of these core concepts in political discourse.
*   **Populism emerges as a complex hybrid strategy:** The populist texts analyzed (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) blend fragmentative tactics (high `Enmity` and `Envy` towards an oligarchic out-group) with cohesive ones (high `Amity` and `Hope` for the in-group). This demonstrates the CFF's ability to capture sophisticated strategies that would be lost in a simple positive/negative binary analysis.
*   **The `Full Cohesion Index` is a robust indicator of democratic health:** The index's near-perfect negative correlation with `Fear` (r = -0.973) and `Enmity` (r = -0.912), and its strong positive correlation with `Individual Dignity` (r = 0.794) and `Amity` (r = 0.803), demonstrates that it effectively synthesizes the core dimensions of the framework into a single, meaningful metric of a text's impact on social cohesion.

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This analysis is situated at the intersection of computational social science, political communication, and democratic theory. Traditional content analysis has often relied on word frequencies or simple sentiment scoring (Pang & Lee, 2008), methods that struggle to capture the rhetorical nuance and strategic ambiguity inherent in political language. The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) addresses this gap by operationalizing concepts from democratic and social theory.

The framework's central tension between `Tribal Dominance` and `Individual Dignity` echoes the classic debate between particularism and universalism in political philosophy (Nussbaum, 1996). `Tribal Dominance` reflects the logic of ingroup/outgroup polarization, a key feature of contemporary populism and political sectarianism (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012). In contrast, `Individual Dignity` aligns with liberal democratic principles emphasizing the inherent worth of each person.

The emotional axis (`Fear` vs. `Hope`) draws on research in political psychology demonstrating that fear-based appeals tend to promote authoritarian attitudes and out-group hostility, while hope-based appeals can foster collective action and social trust (Brader, 2005). Similarly, the relational axis (`Enmity` vs. `Amity`) and the success axis (`Envy` vs. `Compersion`) map onto theories of social capital and civic health, where trust and goodwill are essential for cooperation, while envy and resentment corrode the social fabric (Putnam, 2000).

The CFF's innovation lies in its ability to measure these dimensions independently and synthesize them into higher-order metrics like the `Cohesion Index` and `Tension Indices`. This allows for an empirical investigation of complex rhetorical strategies, such as the "strategic contradiction" of simultaneously invoking hope and fear. This approach provides a quantitative methodology to test theories about political rhetoric's impact on democratic norms, moving from qualitative description to measurable analysis.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description

This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool designed to analyze discourse along five oppositional axes critical to social cohesion:
1.  **Identity:** `Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`
2.  **Emotion:** `Fear` vs. `Hope`
3.  **Success:** `Envy` vs. `Compersion`
4.  **Relation:** `Enmity` vs. `Amity`
5.  **Goals:** `Fragmentative Goals` vs. `Cohesive Goals`

For each dimension, the framework produces a `raw` score (intensity, 0-1), a `salience` score (prominence, 0-1), and a `confidence` score. This multi-faceted output allows for nuanced analysis beyond simple presence or absence. From these raw scores, the CFF calculates three composite **Cohesion Indices** (Descriptive, Motivational, Full) which measure the overall pro-social or anti-social thrust of a text on a scale from -1.0 (maximally fragmentative) to +1.0 (maximally cohesive). It also calculates five **Tension Indices**, which measure the degree of strategic contradiction by quantifying the simultaneous use of opposing concepts.

### Data and Corpus

The analysis was performed on a small, purposive corpus of four political speeches (N=4). Based on the available textual evidence, these documents represent a cross-section of contemporary American political rhetoric: a 2008 concession speech by John McCain, a 2017 House floor speech by Steve King, and two 2025 speeches by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the theme of "fighting oligarchy." This selection, though not representative, is ideally suited for an exploratory study to test the framework's discriminatory power across diverse rhetorical styles.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations

The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational. We interpret descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) to understand the central tendencies and variance of each CFF dimension across the corpus. A Pearson correlation matrix was computed to examine the relationships between all raw scores and derived indices.

**The primary limitation of this study is its extremely small sample size (N=4).** Consequently, the findings are not generalizable to broader political discourse. P-values are not reported for correlations, as they would be statistically meaningless with this sample size. Instead, we interpret the magnitude of the correlation coefficients (`r`) using established conventions (e.g., |r| > 0.5 as strong) to identify patterns and test the framework's internal consistency. The purpose of this report is not to make claims about the state of political discourse, but to demonstrate the analytical potential of the CFF on a controlled, diverse dataset. All conclusions should be understood as illustrative of the method's capabilities, pending validation on a larger corpus.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics: A Corpus of Extremes

The descriptive statistics reveal a corpus characterized by high variance and a general tendency towards fragmentative language. The fragmentative dimensions consistently show higher average scores than their cohesive counterparts: `Tribal Dominance` (M=0.575) vs. `Individual Dignity` (M=0.425); `Fear` (M=0.650) vs. `Hope` (M=0.475); `Enmity` (M=0.650) vs. `Amity` (M=0.550). This indicates that, on average, the language in this sample is more focused on threat, division, and out-group hostility than on unity and optimism.

The high standard deviations across nearly all dimensions are a key finding. For example, `Amity_raw` has a mean of 0.550 but a standard deviation of 0.404, with scores ranging from 0.0 to 0.9. This wide distribution demonstrates that the CFF is not merely capturing a monolithic "political speech" style but is highly sensitive to the vast differences between speakers. The corpus contains texts that are almost purely fragmentative alongside texts that are highly cohesive, confirming the framework's discriminatory power.

The `Full Cohesion Index`, the most comprehensive metric, has a slightly negative mean of -0.149, but its enormous range (-0.716 to +0.802) and high standard deviation (0.670) are the most telling statistics. This confirms the corpus is not homogenous but is composed of radically different rhetorical approaches, which the index successfully captures and quantifies.

#### Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Raw Scores (N=4)
| Dimension | Mean | Std. Dev. | Min | Max |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fragmentative Dimensions** | | | | |
| tribal_dominance_raw | 0.575 | 0.386 | 0.000 | 0.800 |
| fear_raw | 0.650 | 0.370 | 0.100 | 0.900 |
| envy_raw | 0.550 | 0.436 | 0.000 | 0.900 |
| enmity_raw | 0.650 | 0.436 | 0.000 | 0.900 |
| fragmentative_goals_raw | 0.600 | 0.400 | 0.000 | 0.800 |
| **Cohesive Dimensions** | | | | |
| individual_dignity_raw | 0.425 | 0.435 | 0.000 | 0.800 |
| hope_raw | 0.475 | 0.330 | 0.000 | 0.700 |
| compersion_raw | 0.225 | 0.450 | 0.000 | 0.900 |
| amity_raw | 0.550 | 0.404 | 0.000 | 0.900 |
| cohesive_goals_raw | 0.550 | 0.351 | 0.200 | 0.900 |

The high mean score for `Enmity` (M=0.650) is vividly illustrated by the rhetoric of both Steve King and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who, despite their ideological differences, both employ strong out-grouping language. As Ocasio-Cortez stated: *"We are witnessing an oligarchy in America. And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price."* (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This demonstrates how the CFF dimension captures a specific rhetorical function, not just a partisan position.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Cohesion and Tension

The derived CFF metrics provide a synthetic view of the rhetorical strategies at play. The Cohesion and Tension Indices quantify the overall direction and complexity of the discourse.

#### Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Cohesion & Tension Indices (N=4)
| Index | Mean | Std. Dev. | Min | Max |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cohesion Indices** | | | | |
| descriptive_cohesion_index | -0.196 | 0.678 | -0.785 | 0.781 |
| motivational_cohesion_index | -0.139 | 0.662 | -0.692 | 0.813 |
| full_cohesion_index | -0.149 | 0.670 | -0.716 | 0.802 |
| **Tension Indices** | | | | |
| identity_tension | 0.055 | 0.068 | 0.000 | 0.140 |
| emotional_tension | 0.083 | 0.074 | 0.000 | 0.150 |
| success_tension | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| relational_tension | 0.070 | 0.095 | 0.000 | 0.200 |
| goal_tension | 0.077 | 0.061 | 0.000 | 0.150 |
| strategic_contradiction_index | 0.057 | 0.053 | 0.008 | 0.114 |

The `Full Cohesion Index` scores reveal the stark divide in the corpus. The highly positive maximum score (+0.802) is exemplified by John McCain's concession speech, which consistently pairs the acknowledgment of difference with calls for unity. As McCain stated: *"I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together."* (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). In stark contrast, the highly negative minimum score (-0.716) reflects the rhetoric of Steve King, which is almost devoid of cohesive appeals. As King stated: *"this illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body... It's another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here..."* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

A critical finding is the `success_tension` score, which has a mean and standard deviation of zero. This indicates that across all four documents, there was no strategic contradiction on the Envy/Compersion axis. The correlation matrix confirms this variable has zero variance, leading to `NaN` values. This suggests that, for this set of speakers, the framing of success is unambiguous: populist and nativist speakers use pure `Envy` without acknowledging legitimate success of the out-group, while the conciliatory speaker uses pure `Compersion` without expressing resentment. For instance, the evidence for `Compersion` in the Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez texts is explicitly noted as absent, with one finding stating, *"The text's central argument is that the success of the 'oligarchs' is illegitimate and harmful to society, which is the antithesis of the Compersion dimension."* (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This lack of tension is itself a significant finding about the polarized nature of this discourse.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix provides the deepest insights into the framework's structure and the rhetorical strategies present in the data. The results offer powerful validation for the CFF's design and reveal coherent "syndromes" of rhetorical choices.

#### Construct Validity: The Power of Opposition

The CFF is built on five oppositional axes. If the framework has high construct validity, we expect to see strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions. The data provides compelling evidence of this.
*   `tribal_dominance_raw` vs. `compersion_raw`: **r = -0.993 (Very Strong Negative)**
*   `fear_raw` vs. `descriptive_cohesion_index`: **r = -0.988 (Very Strong Negative)**
*   `tribal_dominance_raw` vs. `full_cohesion_index`: **r = -0.975 (Very Strong Negative)**
*   `tribal_dominance_raw` vs. `individual_dignity_raw`: **r = -0.670 (Strong Negative)**
*   `fragmentative_goals_raw` vs. `cohesive_goals_raw`: **r = -0.664 (Strong Negative)**

The near-perfect negative correlation between `Tribal Dominance` and `Compersion` is particularly striking. It suggests that framing the world as a zero-sum contest between tribes is fundamentally incompatible with celebrating the success of others. This is vividly illustrated by contrasting Steve King's focus on in-group victimhood with John McCain's praise for his opponent. As McCain stated: *"Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it..."* (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). This statement is rhetorically impossible within the world-view presented by the high-tribal-dominance texts.

#### Rhetorical Syndromes: The Fragmentative and Cohesive Networks

The matrix reveals two powerful clusters of inter-correlated dimensions, representing coherent and predictable rhetorical strategies.

**The Fragmentative Syndrome:** `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Envy`, `Enmity`, and `Fragmentative Goals` are all intensely and positively correlated.
*   `tribal_dominance_raw` and `fear_raw`: **r = 0.992**
*   `tribal_dominance_raw` and `enmity_raw`: **r = 0.980**
*   `fear_raw` and `fragmentative_goals_raw`: **r = 0.992**

This demonstrates that these are not independent choices but components of a unified rhetorical engine. To evoke `Fear`, these speakers also evoke `Enmity` and `Tribal Dominance`. This strategy is exemplified by the populist rhetoric targeting an oligarchic enemy. As Bernie Sanders stated: *"I will tell you this, in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs."* (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This single statement links an out-group (`oligarchs`) with a threat (`most dangerous addiction`), demonstrating the fusion of these dimensions.

**The Cohesive Syndrome:** A similarly strong positive network exists between `Individual Dignity`, `Hope`, `Amity`, `Compersion`, and `Cohesive Goals`.
*   `individual_dignity_raw` and `cohesive_goals_raw`: **r = 0.993**
*   `individual_dignity_raw` and `amity_raw`: **r = 0.901**
*   `hope_raw` and `amity_raw`: **r = 0.836**

This indicates a strategy built on linking universal human worth to a hopeful, collaborative future. A speaker using this strategy does not simply call for unity but grounds that call in a respect for individual dignity. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated, in a moment blending her populist frame with a cohesive appeal: *"If you are willing to fight for someone you don’t know, you are welcome here."* (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This quote, while part of a broader anti-oligarchy speech, perfectly captures the link between `Amity` (fighting for someone you don't know) and `Individual Dignity` (the principle that makes them worth fighting for).

| full_cohesion_index | amity_raw | 0.803 | Strong Positive |
| full_cohesion_index | compersion_raw | 0.946 | Very Strong Positive |

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlation patterns reveal that the CFF is not just a dictionary of terms but a map of rhetorical logic. The strongest correlations are not arbitrary; they reflect coherent worldviews. The near-perfect negative relationship between the `Full Cohesion Index` and dimensions like `Fear` (r = -0.973) and `Tribal Dominance` (r = -0.975) is the central finding of this analysis. It empirically demonstrates that the language of threat and division is the most powerful force driving discourse towards social fragmentation, at least within this corpus.

The most unexpected finding is the behavior of the `Envy` dimension. While it is part of the fragmentative syndrome (r = 0.802 with `Tribal Dominance`), it is also strongly correlated with the `Strategic Contradiction Index` (r = 0.932). This suggests that appeals to envy and resentment are a key component of rhetorically complex or tense communication. This is seen in the populist speeches, which must balance resentment of the rich with a hopeful vision for their own supporters. As Bernie Sanders stated: *"there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."* (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This statement combines `Envy` (resentment over the wealth transfer) with a `Cohesive Goal` for the in-group ("what we are going to change"), creating the rhetorical tension the CFF is designed to detect.

The framework's construct validity is exceptionally high for an oppositional model. The consistent, strong negative correlations between opposing pairs validate the theoretical assumptions underpinning the CFF. This suggests the framework is well-fitted to the structure of contemporary political argument, which is often framed in such binary terms. The absence of `Success Tension` further suggests that on some issues, polarization is so complete that strategic ambiguity is abandoned in favor of pure, one-sided emotional appeals.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this analysis, the CFF demonstrates high effectiveness in three key areas:

1.  **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully differentiates between highly divergent rhetorical styles. The wide variance in scores, particularly on the composite indices, shows it is sensitive enough to capture the vast gulf between a speech like McCain's (cohesive) and King's (fragmentative). It avoids the flattening effect of simpler sentiment models.
2.  **Construct Validity:** As detailed in section 5.3, the correlation matrix provides strong, empirical support for the framework's theoretical design. Opposing concepts are measured as statistically opposite, and related concepts cluster together in predictable ways.
3.  **Insight Generation:** The CFF moves beyond labeling to explanation. By revealing the underlying correlational structure, it allows for the identification of "rhetorical syndromes." The ability to quantify both cohesion and tension provides a multi-dimensional view of rhetorical strategy, revealing, for example, that the populist speeches are not merely "negative" but are a complex blend of fragmentative attacks and cohesive appeals to a specific in-group. This is a level of insight unavailable through traditional methods.

The primary limitation observed is the potential for zero-variance dimensions, as seen with `Success Tension`. While this is a valid finding about the corpus, it highlights that the utility of the `Tension Indices` depends on the presence of strategic ambiguity in the source material. In hyper-polarized contexts, their value may be diminished.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications

This analysis provides empirical grounding for theories of political polarization and populist communication. The identification of cohesive and fragmentative "syndromes" suggests that political rhetoric may be crystallizing into coherent, mutually exclusive language systems. The fragmentative syndrome, with its tight coupling of fear, enmity, and tribalism, can be understood as the linguistic engine of what social psychologists term "affective polarization"—where political disagreement becomes a matter of visceral dislike for the out-group. As Steve King stated, dehumanizing his opponents: *"an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here."* (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

The CFF's ability to distinguish the hybrid-populist strategy from the purely fragmentative one is a significant theoretical contribution. It suggests that left-populism, as represented here, operates differently from nativist-populism. While both identify a powerful out-group (`oligarchs` vs. `illegal aliens`), the former pairs this with appeals to broad, cross-identity in-group solidarity. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated: *"So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity."* (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This "punch up, unite down" strategy is structurally different from the "punch down, unite insiders" strategy of the nativist archetype. The CFF provides the quantitative tools to measure this structural difference.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns

The four documents in the corpus serve as clear rhetorical archetypes:
1.  **The Conciliator (McCain):** Characterized by the highest `Full Cohesion Index` (+0.802). This style actively uses `Compersion`, `Amity`, and `Individual Dignity` to bridge divides, even while acknowledging them. Its defining feature is extending goodwill to political opponents.
2.  **The Nativist Fragmenter (King):** Characterized by the lowest `Full Cohesion Index` (-0.716). This style is defined by what it lacks: `Hope`, `Amity`, `Compersion`, and `Individual Dignity` are either absent or scored at zero. Its content is almost exclusively `Fear`, `Enmity`, and `Tribal Dominance` directed at a dehumanized out-group.
3.  **The Populist Unifiers (Sanders & Ocasio-Cortez):** Occupying the middle ground on the cohesion scale, this style is the most complex. It scores high on fragmentative dimensions like `Envy` and `Enmity` (directed at oligarchs) but *also* high on cohesive dimensions like `Hope` and `Amity` (directed at the "people" or "working class"). This hybrid nature is what the `Tension Indices` are designed to capture.

### Limitations and Future Directions

The most significant limitation is the N=4 sample size, which makes these findings illustrative rather than generalizable. The analysis demonstrates the *potential* of the CFF, but these specific patterns must be tested on a large, representative corpus of political texts.

Future research should apply the CFF to a large-N dataset of political speeches, legislative debate, and social media content. This would allow for robust statistical testing of the archetypes identified here. Testable hypotheses generated by this analysis include:
*   **H1:** Across a large corpus, the `Full Cohesion Index` will be a significant negative predictor of a country's affective polarization scores.
*   **H2:** Populist rhetoric will consistently exhibit higher `Strategic Contradiction Index` scores than either purely cohesive or purely fragmentative rhetoric.
*   **H3:** The correlation between `Tribal Dominance` and `Fear` is stronger in right-wing populist discourse, while the correlation between `Tribal Dominance` and `Envy` is stronger in left-wing populist discourse.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though exploratory, provides a powerful demonstration of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework's utility. By moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to a theoretically grounded, multi-dimensional model, the CFF successfully quantified the deep structural differences between divergent rhetorical strategies. It validated its own theoretical constructs through strong internal correlations and identified coherent rhetorical syndromes that drive discourse towards either fragmentation or cohesion.

The analysis revealed a political landscape of extremes, from the unifying, conciliatory rhetoric of a traditional concession speech to the purely fragmentative, threat-based language of nativist politics. Crucially, it also mapped the complex, hybrid strategy of modern populism, which weaponizes fragmentative resentment against an elite out-group while simultaneously building cohesive solidarity within a popular in-group. The `Full Cohesion Index` emerged as a robust and sensitive metric for the overall health of political discourse.

While these findings must be validated on a larger scale, this report serves as a proof-of-concept. It shows that computational methods, when guided by robust social theory, can provide profound, replicable, and scalable insights into the linguistic foundations of our public square. The CFF offers a promising path forward for researchers seeking to understand and diagnose the rhetorical forces shaping the future of democratic societies.
