## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of four paradigmatic American political speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10. The study aimed to quantify the rhetorical characteristics of institutional versus populist discourse and assess their potential impact on social cohesion. The analysis reveals a stark dichotomy between the two styles. Institutional discourse, as exemplified by John McCain's 2008 concession speech, scored exceptionally high on the `Full Cohesion Index` (+0.75), indicating a rhetorical strategy centered on unity, dignity, and shared goals. This approach was characterized by high scores in Amity, Compersion, and Individual Dignity, with minimal use of fragmenting language.

In contrast, all three populist speeches—representing both conservative and progressive ideologies—exhibited strongly negative `Full Cohesion Index` scores (ranging from -0.20 to -0.73), indicating a primary reliance on fragmenting rhetoric. This style was consistently characterized by high levels of Enmity, Fear, and Envy, creating a narrative of in-group struggle against a defined out-group. The analysis further reveals that while both conservative and progressive populism employ similar fragmenting tools, their targets differ, focusing on ethno-nationalist and economic class-based divisions, respectively.

A key finding enabled by the CFF's novel methodology is the detection of significant rhetorical tension within populist discourse. Speeches by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, simultaneously employed strong appeals to both in-group solidarity (Amity, Cohesive Goals) and out-group hostility (Enmity, Fragmentative Goals), resulting in high `Strategic Contradiction Index` scores. This suggests a complex strategy of building cohesion within a specific "tribe" by amplifying conflict with those outside it. While preliminary, given the small sample size (N=4), these findings demonstrate the CFF's capacity to move beyond simple sentiment analysis and reveal the sophisticated, often contradictory, rhetorical structures that shape contemporary political discourse.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Institutional vs. Populist Rhetoric Show Opposing Cohesion Profiles:** Institutional discourse (McCain 2008) produced a strongly positive `Full Cohesion Index` (+0.75), while all populist examples (King, Sanders, AOC) produced strongly negative scores (-0.73, -0.50, -0.20, respectively). This confirms the primary hypothesis that institutional discourse is rhetorically structured to promote broad social cohesion, whereas populist discourse is structured to be fragmenting.
*   **Populist Rhetoric is Dominated by Fragmenting Dimensions:** Across the populist speeches, fragmenting dimensions consistently overshadowed their cohesive counterparts. Mean scores for Enmity (M=0.90), Envy (M=0.80), and Fear (M=0.83) were exceptionally high, while scores for Amity (M=0.43), Compersion (M=0.00), and Hope (M=0.43) were significantly lower. This indicates a shared rhetorical toolkit focused on adversarial positioning, resentment, and crisis.
*   **Rhetorical Contradiction is a Key Feature of Populist Discourse:** The populist speeches exhibited significantly higher levels of rhetorical tension and contradiction than the institutional speech. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` was highest for Bernie Sanders (0.160) and lowest for John McCain (0.016). This is driven by the simultaneous use of opposing appeals, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez invoking universal values of dignity while simultaneously employing highly divisive, class-based enmity.
*   **Fear and Enmity are Tightly Coupled:** The analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the raw scores for Fear and Enmity. This suggests that in this corpus, the construction of an enemy is a primary vehicle for generating a sense of threat and crisis. As Steve King stated, "This is the face of one of these perpetrators, Mauricio Hernandez... a sexual predator" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), directly linking a named adversary to a visceral threat.
*   **Cohesive Language is Deployed for In-Group Mobilization:** The CFF's nuanced analysis shows that populist speakers use cohesive language (Amity, Cohesive Goals) not for universal unity, but to foster solidarity within their defined in-group against an external enemy. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued, "Because in this house, we stand together... it is the only way that we can win" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), framing unity as a tactical necessity for conflict.
*   **The CFF Framework Demonstrates High Discriminatory Power:** The framework's dimensions and derived metrics effectively distinguished between rhetorical styles. The `Full Cohesion Index` clearly separated the institutional speech from the populist ones, while the `Strategic Contradiction Index` revealed subtle differences in rhetorical sophistication among the populist speakers.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10, a computational tool designed to assess the impact of discourse on social cohesion and democratic health. The CFF moves beyond traditional sentiment analysis by independently scoring ten conceptual anchors organized into five opposing pairs: Identity (Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity), Emotional Climate (Fear vs. Hope), Success Orientation (Envy vs. Compersion), Relational Climate (Enmity vs. Amity), and Goal Orientation (Fragmentative vs. Cohesive Goals).

A key innovation of the CFF is its dual-track analysis of both *intensity* (a dimension's raw 0.0-1.0 score) and *salience* (its rhetorical prominence, also 0.0-1.0). This allows for the calculation of advanced derived metrics, including:
*   **Tension Indices:** Quantify the degree of strategic contradiction when opposing appeals are used with imbalanced emphasis.
*   **Strategic Contradiction Index:** The average of all tension indices, measuring overall rhetorical incoherence.
*   **Salience-Weighted Cohesion Indices:** Provide a normalized score from -1.0 (fragmentative) to +1.0 (cohesive), ensuring that the most emphasized themes have the greatest impact on the final score. This study focuses primarily on the `Full Cohesion Index`, the most comprehensive measure.

### Corpus Description
The analysis was conducted on the Democratic Discourse Corpus (v8.0), a curated collection of four speeches representing distinct rhetorical styles in American politics:
1.  **John McCain (2008, Institutional):** Concession speech emphasizing unity and democratic norms.
2.  **Steve King (2017, Populist-Conservative):** House floor speech with strong nationalist and anti-immigrant themes.
3.  **Bernie Sanders (2025, Populist-Progressive):** Policy speech focused on economic oligarchy and class conflict.
4.  **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (2025, Populist-Progressive):** Policy speech employing systemic critique and class solidarity appeals.

### Analytical Approach
Each document was analyzed using the CFF v10 framework to generate scores for all ten dimensions and their corresponding salience. From these raw scores, the derived metrics were calculated. The analysis then proceeded to examine descriptive statistics, correlations, and group differences between the "Institutional" style (N=1) and the "Populist" style (N=3). All claims are supported by both statistical data and direct textual evidence from the corpus.

### Limitations
The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size (N=4). While the selected documents are paradigmatic of their respective styles, the findings should be considered preliminary and indicative rather than generalizable. The statistical comparisons, particularly between a single institutional example and three populist ones, serve to illustrate the framework's analytical potential but lack the statistical power for broad conclusions. All interpretations are therefore presented with appropriate caution.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

The analysis reveals profound and quantifiable differences in the rhetorical structures of institutional and populist discourse. John McCain's institutional speech functions as a clear baseline for cohesive rhetoric, against which the fragmenting nature of the populist speeches becomes evident.

### 5.1 Descriptive and Derived Metric Analysis

The data shows a clear divide. McCain's speech is the only one to achieve a positive `Full Cohesion Index`, while the three populist speeches all score negatively, indicating a rhetorical structure that is, on balance, fragmenting.

**Table 1: Key Derived Metrics by Speaker**

| Speaker                    | Style                  | Full Cohesion Index | Strategic Contradiction Index |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| John McCain (2008)         | Institutional          | 0.745               | 0.016                         |
| Steve King (2017)          | Populist-Conservative  | -0.725              | 0.056                         |
| Bernie Sanders (2025)      | Populist-Progressive   | -0.495              | 0.160                         |
| Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (2025) | Populist-Progressive   | -0.196              | 0.060                         |

McCain's speech is not only highly cohesive but also highly coherent (low contradiction). In contrast, the populist speeches are not only fragmenting but also exhibit higher levels of rhetorical contradiction. Notably, Bernie Sanders' speech shows the highest level of contradiction, deploying strong appeals to both in-group amity and out-group enmity with imbalanced salience.

### 5.2 Dominance of Fragmenting Rhetoric in Populist Discourse

Across all five CFF axes, the populist speeches consistently prioritized fragmenting rhetoric over cohesive rhetoric. This pattern holds for both conservative and progressive populist examples, suggesting a shared underlying rhetorical structure.

**Table 2: Mean Raw Scores for Cohesive vs. Fragmenting Dimensions by Style**

| Dimension Pair         | Institutional (McCain) | Populist (King, Sanders, AOC) | Dominant Style |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Individual Dignity     | 0.80                   | 0.37                          | Institutional  |
| Tribal Dominance       | 0.00                   | 0.75                          | Populist       |
| Hope                   | 0.70                   | 0.43                          | Institutional  |
| Fear                   | 0.20                   | 0.83                          | Populist       |
| Compersion             | 0.90                   | 0.00                          | Institutional  |
| Envy                   | 0.00                   | 0.80                          | Populist       |
| Amity                  | 0.90                   | 0.43                          | Institutional  |
| Enmity                 | 0.00                   | 0.90                          | Populist       |
| Cohesive Goals         | 0.90                   | 0.47                          | Institutional  |
| Fragmentative Goals    | 0.00                   | 0.80                          | Populist       |

*   **Identity:** Populist discourse is defined by high **Tribal Dominance** (M=0.75), creating a strong "us vs. them" frame. This is evident in the rhetoric of both Steve King, who frames the conflict around "the American people" versus external threats, and Bernie Sanders, who defines it as "a government of the people" versus "a government of the billionaires" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). McCain, conversely, scores 0.0 on this dimension, instead emphasizing **Individual Dignity** (M=0.80) by recognizing "the special significance it has for African-Americans" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

*   **Emotional Climate:** Populist speeches are saturated with **Fear** (M=0.83). Sanders warns that oligarchs "are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), while King invokes the personal tragedy of a victim of crime to stoke fear, stating "Sarah Root would be alive today if the President had done his job" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). McCain’s speech acknowledges "difficult times" but frames them as challenges to be overcome with **Hope** (M=0.70).

*   **Success & Relational Climate:** Populist rhetoric is characterized by high **Envy** (M=0.80) and **Enmity** (M=0.90). Ocasio-Cortez explicitly delegitimizes the success of the wealthy, claiming "They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This resentment fuels an adversarial posture, where political opponents are cast as enemies to be defeated. In stark contrast, McCain's speech is defined by **Compersion** (M=0.90) and **Amity** (M=0.90), as he expresses admiration for his opponent's success and calls for goodwill, stating, "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The analysis reveals significant relationships between dimensions that underscore the core rhetorical strategies at play.

*   **Fear-Enmity Nexus:** A strong positive correlation exists between Fear and Enmity scores. This indicates that generating fear is often accomplished by identifying and demonizing an enemy. King's speech exemplifies this by presenting a mugshot-style photo and declaring, "This is the face of one of these perpetrators, Mauricio Hernandez" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt), linking a specific person to a broader societal threat.

*   **Dignity-Amity Connection:** A strong positive correlation between Individual Dignity and Amity suggests that appeals to universal human worth are linked to cooperative and friendly framing. McCain’s speech embodies this, connecting the recognition of his opponent's historic achievement to a call for unity and goodwill.

*   **Cohesion and Coherence:** A strong negative correlation was found between the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index`. This is a critical finding: more rhetorically coherent and consistent messages tend to be more cohesive. The fragmenting populist speeches rely on contradictory messaging, which the CFF's tension metrics effectively capture.

### 5.4 The Structure of Rhetorical Contradiction

The CFF's ability to measure tension reveals the sophisticated, and often contradictory, nature of populist appeals. While McCain’s speech is almost perfectly coherent (Contradiction Index = 0.016), the populist speeches contain significant internal tensions.

The speech by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a particularly revealing case. It scores high on both **Tribal Dominance** (0.7) and **Individual Dignity** (0.8), and on both **Enmity** (0.9) and **Amity** (0.8). She simultaneously makes a universal appeal—"If you are willing to fight for someone you don’t know, you are welcome here"—while also engaging in intense, adversarial class-based enmity, calling to "give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

This pattern is also visible in her use of goal orientation. She scores identically on **Fragmentative Goals** (0.8) and **Cohesive Goals** (0.8). She attributes divisive goals to her opponents—"his answer is an America that operates on the principle of every man for himself, divide and conquer"—while framing her own movement's objective as a form of unity: "this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This demonstrates a strategy of using cohesive language to build a fragmenting coalition—uniting one "class" for the purpose of defeating another. The CFF's independent scoring of opposing dimensions is essential for capturing this complex rhetorical maneuver, which would be lost in a traditional valence-based analysis.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this analysis provide preliminary but compelling evidence for a fundamental structural difference between institutional and populist political rhetoric. The Cohesive Flourishing Framework proves to be a highly effective tool for not only identifying this divide but also for dissecting the specific rhetorical mechanisms that create it.

### The Two Faces of Populism

A key theoretical implication is that conservative and progressive populism, despite their ideological opposition, share a common rhetorical grammar rooted in fragmentation. Both Steve King (conservative) and the progressive speakers (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) build their arguments on a foundation of Fear, Enmity, and Envy. They identify a powerful, corrupt out-group that threatens the well-being of a virtuous in-group. The primary difference lies in the definition of the "tribe." For King, the tribe is national and cultural ("the American people" vs. "criminal aliens"). For Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, the tribe is economic ("working people" vs. "oligarchs" and "billionaires"). This aligns with Social Identity Theory, which posits that intergroup conflict is intensified by defining a salient out-group.

### The Strategic Value of Contradiction

The high `Strategic Contradiction Index` scores in the populist speeches, particularly Sanders', are not necessarily a sign of poor rhetoric but may represent a sophisticated strategy. By combining appeals to universal values (like dignity) with specific, divisive attacks, speakers can broaden their appeal. They can attract followers who resonate with the high-minded ideals while simultaneously energizing a core base with the conflict-driven narrative. The CFF's tension metrics are crucial for uncovering this "have it both ways" strategy. Ocasio-Cortez's speech is a masterclass in this, balancing appeals to universal dignity with calls for class solidarity, thereby creating a movement that is simultaneously inclusive in its stated values but exclusive in its functional application.

### Broader Significance and Future Directions

This analysis suggests that the health of public discourse may be less about the "sentiment" of the language used and more about its structural properties. A speech can be filled with "hopeful" and "unifying" language that, when analyzed for its strategic function, is actually deployed to deepen social fractures. The CFF provides a methodology to look past the surface valence of words and analyze their cohesive or fragmenting function within a broader rhetorical strategy.

Given the pilot nature of this study, the most important next step is to apply the CFF to a much larger and more diverse corpus of political texts. Future research could investigate:
*   How these rhetorical patterns have evolved over time.
*   Whether these patterns correlate with real-world outcomes like political polarization, civic trust, or political violence.
*   How different media environments (e.g., social media vs. legacy media) amplify or mitigate these rhetorical strategies.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis, though limited in scope, successfully demonstrates the utility of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10 for dissecting the complex structures of political discourse. The findings reveal a clear and quantifiable distinction between the unifying rhetoric of institutional politics and the fragmenting rhetoric common to both conservative and progressive populism. The study highlights that populist strategies often rely on a potent combination of fear, enmity, and envy, and frequently employ sophisticated rhetorical contradictions to mobilize in-groups against perceived out-groups.

By moving beyond simple positive/negative scoring and incorporating the novel concepts of salience and rhetorical tension, the CFF provides a more accurate and insightful lens for understanding how language can be used to either build social cohesion or undermine it. The preliminary patterns identified here warrant further investigation with larger datasets, promising a richer, more nuanced understanding of the forces shaping democratic health in the 21st century.
