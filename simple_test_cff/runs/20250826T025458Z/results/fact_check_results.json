The report explicitly states that the framework used is 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1' and refers to 'its specification' (Section 4.1). The `experiment.md` (Source 2) further specifies the framework as 'cff_v10.md'. However, the provided evidence database (RAG index) does not contain the `cff_v10.md` file or any other document that constitutes the 'framework specification' itself. While some provided JSON files (e.g., `derived_metrics_results.json`, `statistical_results.json`) mention some dimensions and derived metrics, and even describe their calculation, they do not represent the comprehensive 'framework specification' where these dimensions are formally defined. Therefore, it is impossible to verify that the dimensions are 'defined in the framework specification' as the specification document itself is absent from the RAG index.",
