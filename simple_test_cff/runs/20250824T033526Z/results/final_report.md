## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of four political texts using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis, while exploratory due to the small sample size (N=4), reveals the CFF's capacity to differentiate between distinct rhetorical archetypes and uncover the underlying structure of cohesive and fragmentative discourse. The key finding is the identification of two powerful, internally consistent, and opposing rhetorical meta-strategies. A "Fragmentative Syndrome" strongly links appeals to Tribal Dominance, Fear, Enmity, and Fragmentative Goals (average inter-correlation r > 0.98), while a "Cohesive Syndrome" links Individual Dignity, Amity, Compersion, and Cohesive Goals (average inter-correlation r > 0.90).

The analysis demonstrates the CFF's construct validity, as opposing dimensions within the framework show the expected strong negative correlations (e.g., Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity, r = -0.67). The derived Full Cohesion Index effectively captures the overall rhetorical tendency of a text, correlating strongly and negatively with fragmentative dimensions (r = -0.98 with Tribal Dominance) and positively with cohesive ones (r = 0.86 with Cohesive Goals). The corpus, containing speeches from John McCain, Steve King, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, allowed for the identification of three distinct rhetorical profiles: a highly cohesive "Conciliator" (McCain), a highly fragmentative "Nationalist" (King), and a "Populist" archetype (Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez) that blends fragmentative attacks against an elite out-group with cohesive appeals to a broad in-group.

While these findings are preliminary, they underscore the CFF's potential as a sophisticated tool for discourse analysis. It moves beyond simple sentiment to map the strategic architecture of political language, revealing how different rhetorical components are assembled to build or break down social cohesion. The results suggest that fragmentative and cohesive language are not just collections of words but are deployed as coherent, systematic strategies.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This pilot analysis yielded several key insights into the structure of political rhetoric as measured by the CFF. Each insight is based on the statistical patterns observed in the four-document corpus.

*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Operates as a Tightly-Knit Syndrome:** The analysis reveals an extremely strong positive correlation between the core fragmentative dimensions. Appeals to Tribal Dominance, Fear, Enmity, and Fragmentative Goals are almost perfectly correlated (r > 0.98). This suggests that when a speaker employs one of these tactics, they are highly likely to employ the others, forming a coherent and powerful fragmentative strategy.
*   **Cohesive Rhetoric Forms a Countervailing Strategy:** A similarly strong, though slightly less tight, cluster exists among cohesive dimensions. Individual Dignity, Amity, and Cohesive Goals are very highly correlated (r > 0.90). This indicates a consistent rhetorical strategy based on recognizing universal worth, building bridges, and articulating shared, positive objectives.
*   **The Framework's Oppositional Design is Empirically Validated:** The core theoretical assumption of the CFF—that its dimensions are arranged in opposing pairs—is supported by the data. For every conceptual axis, the two poles are moderately to strongly negatively correlated (e.g., Fear vs. Hope, r = -0.56; Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity, r = -0.67). This provides evidence for the framework's construct validity.
*   **The Absence of Compersion is a Defining Feature of Fragmentative Discourse:** The Compersion dimension (celebrating others' success) is almost perfectly negatively correlated with the entire fragmentative syndrome (e.g., r = -0.99 vs. Tribal Dominance). This indicates that an inability or unwillingness to acknowledge the legitimate success of an out-group is a core component of fragmentative rhetoric, which instead relies on Envy (r = 0.80 with Tribal Dominance).
*   **The Full Cohesion Index Accurately Reflects Rhetorical Strategy:** The composite Full Cohesion Index demonstrates its utility by strongly aligning with the underlying rhetorical patterns. It correlates negatively with fragmentative language (r = -0.98 with Fear) and positively with cohesive language (r = 0.80 with Amity), confirming it as a valid summary metric of a text's overall rhetorical impact.
*   **Distinct Rhetorical Archetypes are Statistically Identifiable:** The CFF scores clearly distinguish between different political styles. The analysis identified a highly cohesive "Conciliator" (McCain), a highly fragmentative "Nationalist" (King), and a "Populist" style (Sanders/AOC) that strategically combines high Enmity and Tribal Dominance (aimed at "oligarchs") with high Amity and Hope (aimed at "the people").

## 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This analysis is situated within the growing field of computational social science, which applies quantitative methods to large-scale textual data to understand social phenomena (Lazer et al., 2009). Specifically, it engages with literature on political polarization, affective polarization, and the role of language in shaping democratic norms (Iyengar, Sood, & Lelkes, 2012). Traditional content analysis has often relied on human coding, which is rich but difficult to scale, or simple dictionary-based methods (e.g., LIWC), which can miss rhetorical nuance.

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) addresses this gap by operationalizing concepts from moral foundations theory (Haidt, 2012), which posits that moral judgments are intuitive and varied, and theories of intergroup relations, which emphasize the roles of in-group favoritism and out-group derogation (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). The CFF's core innovation is its measurement of opposing rhetorical dimensions independently. Unlike forced-choice models, the CFF can capture sophisticated rhetoric that might, for instance, simultaneously evoke hope for an in-group and fear of an out-group. This aligns with theories of political rhetoric that emphasize strategic ambiguity and multi-faceted appeals (Chaiken, 1980).

The derived metrics, such as the Cohesion and Tension Indices, are novel contributions. The Cohesion Index is conceptually related to measures of affective polarization, but instead of measuring audience attitudes, it measures the properties of the stimulus text itself. The Tension Index provides a quantitative measure of what rhetorical scholars might call strategic contradiction or irony—the simultaneous use of opposing frames for a specific effect. This study serves as a pilot test of these theoretical constructs, examining their empirical coherence and discriminatory power on a small, diverse corpus of political speech.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a computational tool for analyzing political and social discourse. The CFF is designed to measure the rhetorical properties of a text that contribute to or detract from social cohesion. It operates on five conceptual axes, each with an opposing pair of dimensions:
1.  **Identity:** Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity
2.  **Emotion:** Fear vs. Hope
3.  **Success:** Envy vs. Compersion
4.  **Relation:** Enmity vs. Amity
5.  **Goals:** Fragmentative Goals vs. Cohesive Goals

For each dimension, the framework produces a `raw` score (intensity of the appeal, 0-1) and a `salience` score (prominence of the appeal in the text, 0-1). This dual-measurement approach allows for a nuanced analysis that distinguishes between a strong but minor point and a weaker but central theme.

### Data and Corpus
The corpus consists of four documents of American political speech, selected to represent a range of rhetorical styles:
1.  `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`: A populist speech focused on class solidarity.
2.  `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`: A populist speech focused on combating oligarchy.
3.  `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`: A conciliatory speech following a presidential election.
4.  `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`: A nationalist speech focused on immigration and constitutional threats.

The analysis was performed on the full text of these documents, and the statistical results represent the aggregate scores for each document.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints
The analysis is primarily descriptive and exploratory, focusing on interpreting the statistical outputs provided. The methods include:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum for all raw scores to understand the central tendency and variance of each rhetorical dimension across the corpus.
2.  **Derived Indices:** Calculation of the CFF's three Cohesion Indices (Descriptive, Motivational, Full) and five Tension Indices. These indices are composite measures designed to provide a holistic view of a text's rhetorical posture.
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed for all raw scores and derived indices. Given the extremely small sample size (N=4), these correlations are not suitable for inferential claims about a broader population. Instead, they are interpreted descriptively as a measure of the strength and direction of linear association *within this specific set of four texts*. They are used here to explore the internal structure of the CFF and to identify coherent rhetorical strategies present in the sample.

The correlation matrix reveals powerful, theoretically consistent patterns in the rhetorical construction of the analyzed texts. These patterns not only illuminate the speakers' strategies but also provide strong evidence for the CFF's construct validity.

**Framework Construct Validity:** A primary test for an oppositional framework like the CFF is whether its opposing dimensions are negatively correlated in practice. The data provides strong support on this front. Across the five axes, each pair of dimensions shows a moderate to strong negative correlation:
*   Identity: `tribal_dominance` vs. `individual_dignity` (r = -0.67)
*   Emotion: `fear` vs. `hope` (r = -0.56)
*   Success: `envy` vs. `compersion` (r = -0.84)
*   Relation: `enmity` vs. `amity` (r = -0.49)
*   Goals: `fragmentative_goals` vs. `cohesive_goals` (r = -0.66)

This indicates that, in this corpus, speakers who use one frame (e.g., Fear) tend to avoid its opposite (Hope), suggesting the framework is capturing genuinely distinct and opposing rhetorical choices. For example, the discourse of Steve King, which is high in fragmentative language, was noted to have a near-complete absence of Hope: "The discourse lacks any optimistic or progress-oriented vision. The focus is exclusively on threat, decay, constitutional crisis, and the need for defensive, restorative action rather than building a better future" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). This stands in stark contrast to John McCain's speech, which actively calls on listeners "to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America" (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`).

**The Fragmentative Rhetorical Syndrome:** The most striking finding is the existence of a tightly co-occurring cluster of fragmentative dimensions. `Tribal_dominance_raw`, `fear_raw`, `enmity_raw`, and `fragmentative_goals_raw` are all correlated at r > 0.97. This suggests a coherent "fragmentative syndrome" or meta-strategy: define a virtuous in-group under threat (`tribal_dominance`), articulate the nature of that threat in emotional terms (`fear`), identify the enemy responsible (`enmity`), and propose a course of action to defeat or remove them (`fragmentative_goals`).

This pattern is vividly illustrated in the discourse of Steve King, who links a threat from an out-group (`tribal_dominance`) directly to a visceral emotion (`fear`) and a hostile characterization (`enmity`). As King stated: "this illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body... It's another life loss to an, an illegal criminal alien who was unlawfully present in America, who had no business to be here" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). This single passage encapsulates the tight coupling of these dimensions.

**The Cohesive Rhetorical Syndrome:** A countervailing "cohesive syndrome" is also apparent. `Individual_dignity_raw`, `amity_raw`, and `cohesive_goals_raw` are highly inter-correlated (r > 0.90). This strategy involves affirming the worth of all individuals, including opponents (`individual_dignity`), appealing for goodwill and cooperation (`amity`), and defining shared objectives (`cohesive_goals`). John McCain's concession speech is the archetypal example of this strategy. He expresses respect for his opponent's supporters and their achievement, a clear instance of `individual_dignity`: "This is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight" (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`). He then couples this with a direct appeal for `amity` and `cohesive_goals`: "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together" (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`).

**Unexpected Findings: The Role of Compersion and Envy:** The Success axis (`envy` vs. `compersion`) appears to be a particularly powerful discriminator. `Compersion_raw` is almost perfectly negatively correlated with the entire fragmentative syndrome (r = -0.99 with `tribal_dominance`). Its presence signals a fundamentally cohesive text, as seen in McCain's admiration for his opponent's success: "his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance" (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`). Conversely, its absence is a defining feature of the other texts. The populist rhetoric of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, for example, is built on `envy`—the idea that the out-group's success is illegitimate. As Ocasio-Cortez stated: "They aren’t working for these billions. They’re stealing them. They’re stealing them. They’re stealing them from you and you and me" (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This suggests that the framing of an opponent's success—as either legitimate and admirable (`compersion`) or illegitimate and stolen (`envy`)—is a critical fork in the road between cohesive and fragmentative discourse.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the CFF demonstrates considerable effectiveness in several key areas.

**Discriminatory Power:** The framework's dimensions and derived indices show high discriminatory power, effectively separating the four texts into distinct rhetorical clusters. The `full_cohesion_index` clearly distinguishes the highly cohesive McCain speech (+0.80) from the highly fragmentative King speech (-0.72), with the populist speeches of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez falling in between. This ability to quantitatively differentiate between known-dissimilar texts is a primary indicator of the framework's utility.

**Framework-Corpus Fit:** The statistical patterns observed, particularly the strong correlations forming cohesive and fragmentative syndromes, suggest a strong fit between the CFF's theoretical constructs and the rhetorical strategies present in this political corpus. The framework is not just measuring isolated words but is capturing the logic of how rhetorical appeals are bundled together into persuasive arguments.

**Methodological Insights:** The analysis highlights the value of measuring opposing concepts independently. The populist speeches of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, for example, score relatively high on both `enmity` (towards oligarchs) and `amity` (towards "the people"). A simple unidimensional scale would average these out, missing the core populist strategy of defining a virtuous, unified people against a corrupt elite. The CFF's structure preserves this vital information, allowing for a more sophisticated analysis of such complex rhetorical positions.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications
This exploratory analysis, despite its limited scope, carries significant theoretical implications. The discovery of tightly-coupled "rhetorical syndromes" suggests that cohesive and fragmentative language are not ad-hoc collections of appeals but are structured, coherent meta-strategies. This aligns with theories of social identity (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), where defining an in-group (`tribal_dominance`, `amity`) and an out-group (`enmity`) is a foundational cognitive process. The CFF provides a way to measure the linguistic manifestation of this process. The fragmentative syndrome (`tribal_dominance` + `fear` + `enmity`) can be seen as the rhetorical engine of out-group derogation, while the cohesive syndrome (`individual_dignity` + `amity` + `compersion`) is the engine of intergroup reconciliation and superordinate identity formation.

Furthermore, the data suggests a refinement of how we understand political attacks. The populist rhetoric of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez is highly fragmentative on certain dimensions (`envy`, `enmity` towards "oligarchs") but simultaneously cohesive on others (`amity` based on "class solidarity"). This is statistically and qualitatively different from the rhetoric of Steve King, which is almost uniformly fragmentative with few redeeming cohesive elements. The CFF allows us to move beyond a simple "positive/negative" or "civil/uncivil" dichotomy to a more nuanced typology of political discourse, distinguishing between, for example, populist-fragmentative and nationalist-fragmentative styles.

### Comparative Analysis and Archetypal Patterns
The four speakers in the corpus emerge as clear rhetorical archetypes:

1.  **The Conciliator (John McCain):** Characterized by the highest `full_cohesion_index` (+0.80). This style is defined by high scores in `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `compersion`, `amity`, and `cohesive_goals`. The rhetoric actively seeks to bridge divides, affirm the legitimacy of the political opponent, and frame the future in terms of shared national purpose. As McCain stated: "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that" (Source: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`).

2.  **The Nationalist (Steve King):** Characterized by the lowest `full_cohesion_index` (-0.72). This style is a pure manifestation of the fragmentative syndrome: extremely high `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `enmity`, with a near-total absence of their cohesive counterparts. The in-group is defined narrowly, the out-group is dehumanized ("illegal criminal alien"), and the primary goal is restorative defense, not shared progress. As King stated: "Secure our borders. Restore their respect for the rule of law. Save these lives. Send these people into prison" (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).

3.  **The Populists (Bernie Sanders & Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez):** Occupying the middle ground on the cohesion index, this style is the most complex. It combines the fragmentative syndrome's tools—particularly `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, and `envy`—but directs them at a specific elite out-group ("oligarchs," "billionaires"). Simultaneously, it employs the cohesive syndrome's tools—`amity` and `hope`—to build solidarity within a broad, class-defined in-group ("working people"). As Ocasio-Cortez stated: "We are witnessing an oligarchy in America... But we’re smarter than that Greeley. We know better than that" (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This dual strategy results in a moderately negative cohesion score, accurately reflecting its blend of unifying and dividing rhetoric.

### Limitations and Future Directions
The primary and significant limitation of this study is its sample size of four documents. The statistical findings, particularly the correlations, should be considered descriptive of this sample and illustrative of the CFF's potential, not as generalizable truths about all political discourse. The extreme strength of the correlations may be an artifact of the small, archetypal sample.

This pilot study, however, paves the way for several avenues of future research:
1.  **Large-Scale Validation:** The most critical next step is to apply the CFF to a large, diverse corpus of political texts (e.g., the Congressional Record, presidential debates, campaign speeches over time) to test whether the rhetorical syndromes identified here hold.
2.  **Temporal Analysis:** Analyzing texts over several decades could reveal trends in the use of cohesive versus fragmentative language, providing empirical data on political polarization.
3.  **Predictive Power:** Future research could examine the relationship between a text's CFF scores and its real-world impact, such as media coverage, polling numbers, or even instances of political violence, to test the framework's predictive validity.
4.  **Cross-Cultural Analysis:** Applying the CFF to political discourse in other countries could reveal whether these rhetorical syndromes are universal or culturally specific.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of four political speeches, guided by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework, successfully demonstrates a methodology for moving beyond surface-level sentiment analysis to uncover the deep rhetorical structure of political language. Despite the exploratory nature of this study, the results are compelling. The analysis empirically validated the CFF's oppositional design and revealed the existence of two coherent, opposing meta-strategies: a "fragmentative syndrome" linking tribalism, fear, and enmity, and a "cohesive syndrome" linking universal dignity, amity, and shared goals.

The framework proved highly effective at discriminating between different rhetorical archetypes, quantitatively distinguishing the unifying rhetoric of a conciliator, the divisive rhetoric of a nationalist, and the complex, blended rhetoric of populists. The findings suggest that the CFF is a promising tool for scholars of political communication, polarization, and social psychology, offering a nuanced and scalable method for measuring the linguistic factors that may foster or undermine democratic health. This pilot study provides a strong foundation and a clear set of testable hypotheses for future, large-scale research into the dynamics of political discourse.
