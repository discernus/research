## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a preliminary computational analysis of a four-document political discourse corpus using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis aimed to extract insights into how language impacts community cohesion and democratic health by moving beyond simple sentiment analysis to capture sophisticated rhetorical patterns. Due to the pilot nature of this study (N=4), all findings should be considered indicative and preliminary, intended to generate hypotheses for larger-scale research rather than to draw generalizable conclusions.

The analysis reveals a starkly polarized rhetorical landscape within the small corpus. The primary finding is the emergence of two distinct and oppositional meta-strategies. A "Cohesive" strategy systematically combines appeals to **Individual Dignity**, **Hope**, **Amity**, and **Compersion**. Conversely, a "Fragmentative" strategy links **Tribal Dominance**, **Fear**, **Enmity**, and **Envy**. These clusters are not only internally coherent but are strongly negatively correlated with each other, suggesting two mutually exclusive rhetorical logics at play. For instance, the framework's core oppositional pairs demonstrated strong construct validity, with dimensions like **Compersion** and **Envy** showing a near-perfect negative correlation (`r` = -0.98). The `Full Cohesion Index`, a key CFF metric, effectively captured this polarization, with scores ranging from a highly cohesive +0.84 to a highly fragmentative -0.74.

The CFF's novel metrics provided additional layers of insight. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` (SCI) successfully quantified the degree of mixed messaging within documents, identifying one text with significantly higher rhetorical tension (`SCI` = 0.10) compared to the others, which were more internally consistent. This demonstrates the framework's capacity to fulfill its core *raison d'Ãªtre*: preserving complex rhetorical information where competing appeals are used simultaneously. While the absence of a corpus manifest precluded a formal speaker-level analysis, the data suggests the CFF is a promising tool for identifying and dissecting rhetorical archetypes, differentiating between consistently cohesive, consistently fragmentative, and strategically complex communication styles.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This preliminary analysis yielded several key insights into the rhetorical patterns within the corpus, highlighting the utility of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

*   **Rhetoric Clusters into Opposing Archetypes:** The data strongly suggests the existence of two coherent, opposing rhetorical strategies. A "Fragmentative" archetype is characterized by the co-occurrence of **Tribal Dominance**, **Fear**, and **Enmity** (e.g., `Tribal Dominance` and `Fear` raw scores correlate at `r` = 0.996). A "Cohesive" archetype links **Individual Dignity**, **Hope**, and **Amity** (e.g., `Individual Dignity` and `Cohesive Goals` salience correlate at `r` = 0.90). These two clusters are mutually antagonistic.

*   **Framework Construct Validity Appears Strong:** The CFF's oppositional design is empirically supported by this preliminary data. Paired dimensions exhibit strong negative correlations as theoretically predicted. The most striking examples are the near-perfect inverse relationships between `Compersion` and `Envy` raw scores (`r` = -0.98) and, even more starkly, between `Compersion Salience` and `Tribal Dominance Salience` (`r` = -1.00), indicating they represent mutually exclusive rhetorical choices in this corpus.

*   **Corpus Exhibits Extreme Rhetorical Polarization:** The `Full Cohesion Index`, which measures the overall pro-social tilt of a document, shows a dramatic split. Scores range from a highly cohesive +0.84 (John McCain) to a deeply fragmentative -0.74 (Steve King). The corpus average (`M` = -0.11, `SD` = 0.67) is misleading; the high standard deviation indicates a bimodal distribution with no documents occupying the middle ground, pointing to a highly polarized rhetorical environment in this specific sample.

*   **Strategic Contradiction Varies and Is Measurable:** The `Strategic Contradiction Index` (SCI), designed to capture mixed messaging, effectively differentiated the documents. While most texts were rhetorically consistent (low SCI), one document (Bernie Sanders) registered a score of 0.10, more than double the next highest score. This suggests a strategy that simultaneously employs competing appeals (e.g., high `Enmity` and moderate `Amity`), a nuance lost in traditional analysis.

*   **Fragmentative Rhetoric Prioritizes Group Identity:** The analysis indicates a powerful link between fragmentative rhetoric and appeals to group-based identity over universal dignity. The `Tribal Dominance` raw score is almost perfectly correlated with the `Fragmentative Goals` raw score (`r` = 0.99) and strongly negatively correlated with the `Individual Dignity` raw score (`r` = -0.78). This suggests that rhetoric focused on in-group dominance is a primary vehicle for advancing fragmentative social objectives. This is exemplified in discourse that frames political outcomes as zero-sum battles, such as when Steve King warns that American culture, `"instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment"` (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`).

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This analysis employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a tool designed to analyze political and social discourse. The CFF evaluates texts along five oppositional axes: Identity (**Tribal Dominance** vs. **Individual Dignity**), Emotion (**Fear** vs. **Hope**), Success (**Envy** vs. **Compersion**), Relation (**Enmity** vs. **Amity**), and Goals (**Fragmentative Goals** vs. **Cohesive Goals**). For each of these 10 core dimensions, the framework generates a raw intensity score (0-1) and a salience score (0-1), representing the strength and prominence of the theme, respectively.

A key feature of the CFF is its ability to score opposing dimensions independently, thereby capturing the complexity of texts that use competing appeals simultaneously. From these base scores, the analysis calculates several derived metrics:
*   **Tension Indices:** Quantify the conflict between opposing dimensions within a text.
*   **Strategic Contradiction Index (SCI):** The mean of the five tension indices, providing a single measure of a document's overall rhetorical incoherence or complexity.
*   **Cohesion Indices:** Salience-weighted composite scores that measure a document's overall orientation toward social cohesion or fragmentation. The `Full Cohesion Index` is the most comprehensive of these.

### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The dataset for this analysis consists of CFF scores for a corpus of four documents of American political discourse. The statistical results were pre-computed and provided in a structured format. The analysis was performed on this statistical output, focusing on interpretation and pattern recognition.

The corpus itself was not fully described, as the `corpus_manifest.json` file was not available. This prevented a systematic analysis by speaker attributes (e.g., party affiliation). However, document filenames (`john_mccain_2008_concession.txt`, `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`, `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`, `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`) allowed for the inference of speakers for evidence citation purposes.

### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The analytical approach is primarily descriptive and correlational. It involves the interpretation of summary statistics (means, standard deviations) and a Pearson correlation matrix to identify relationships between rhetorical dimensions. The analysis focuses on interpreting the magnitude and direction of these statistical patterns to understand the rhetorical strategies present in the corpus.

The most significant constraint is the extremely small sample size (N=4). This limitation means that while correlation coefficients can be calculated to describe relationships within this specific dataset, they lack statistical power and cannot be generalized. P-values are not reported for correlations as they would be meaningless. Therefore, all findings are presented as preliminary observations of the data, intended to serve as a proof-of-concept for the CFF and to generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research. The tone of this report is intentionally cautious to reflect this constraint.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An examination of the descriptive statistics for the corpus reveals a landscape of high variance and polarization across the CFF dimensions. The mean scores for opposing dimensions are often numerically close, but the high standard deviations indicate that this is an artifact of averaging highly polarized scores rather than a reflection of moderate, balanced rhetoric.

The `Full Cohesion Index`, the framework's primary indicator of a document's overall rhetorical effect, has a mean of -0.11 but a very large standard deviation (`SD` = 0.67). This is driven by a wide range from a minimum of -0.74 to a maximum of +0.84, confirming that the corpus contains examples of both highly fragmentative and highly cohesive speech, with no documents occupying the center. Similarly, fragmentative dimensions like `Tribal Dominance` (`M` = 0.56, `SD` = 0.39) and `Envy` (`M` = 0.63, `SD` = 0.43) show high average intensity and variance. Their cohesive counterparts, `Individual Dignity` (`M` = 0.48, `SD` = 0.38) and `Compersion` (`M` = 0.23, `SD` = 0.45), show lower means but comparable variance, indicating they are strongly present in some documents and entirely absent in others.

| Full Cohesion Index             | -0.11 | 0.67      | -0.74   | 0.84    |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The CFF's derived metrics offer a more nuanced view beyond simple dimensional scores. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` (SCI) provides a clear example. The mean SCI for the corpus is low (`M` = 0.05), suggesting that, on average, the documents employ internally consistent rhetorical strategies. However, the document-level data reveals important variance. The speech by Bernie Sanders (`SCI` = 0.10) stands out as having a significantly higher level of rhetorical contradiction. This is driven by tensions across multiple axes, including `Relational Tension` (0.18) and `Identity Tension` (0.14), indicating a complex message that simultaneously invokes themes of `Enmity` against an out-group and `Amity` within an in-group, a classic populist construction. In contrast, John McCain's speech (`SCI` = 0.01) is exceptionally consistent, with near-zero tension on all axes.

The `Full Cohesion Index` effectively quantifies the stark differences in the documents' overall rhetorical posture. John McCain's concession speech is powerfully cohesive (`FCI` = 0.84). At the opposite end, Steve King's floor speech is deeply fragmentative (`FCI` = -0.74). The speeches by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (`FCI` = -0.17) and Bernie Sanders (`FCI` = -0.37) are also on the fragmentative side of the spectrum, though less intensely so. This metric successfully translates the complex, multi-dimensional CFF scores into a single, interpretable measure of a document's likely impact on social cohesion.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of rhetorical strategies within the corpus. The most significant finding is the emergence of two powerful, opposing clusters of dimensions.

**The Fragmentative Cluster:** This strategy is characterized by strong positive correlations between dimensions that divide and create conflict. Key relationships include:
*   `Tribal Dominance` raw and `Fear` raw (`r` = 0.996)
*   `Tribal Dominance` salience and `Enmity` salience (`r` = 0.995)
*   `Envy` raw and `Enmity` raw (`r` = 0.982)
*   `Fragmentative Goals` raw and `Enmity` salience (`r` = 0.998)

This suggests a coherent strategy where appeals to in-group dominance are packaged with fear-based messaging, resentment towards out-groups (envy), and explicit hostility (enmity) to advance socially fragmentative goals. This pattern is evident in the rhetoric of Steve King, who argues for the preservation of a specific culture against perceived threats, a goal he frames as existentially urgent: `"We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and defend"` (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`), a statement that, in context, supports a fragmentative, in-group-focused agenda.

**The Cohesive Cluster:** This strategy is characterized by strong positive correlations between dimensions that unite and build trust. Key relationships include:
*   `Individual Dignity` raw and `Amity` raw (`r` = 0.849)
*   `Individual Dignity` salience and `Cohesive Goals` salience (`r` = 0.899)
*   `Amity` raw and `Cohesive Goals` raw (`r` = 0.999)

This indicates a strategy where emphasizing the inherent worth of each individual is linked to messages of goodwill and shared, constructive social goals. This approach is exemplified by rhetoric that seeks to build broad coalitions, such as when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez states, `"So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity"` (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). While her overall speech scores as fragmentative due to high `Enmity` and `Envy`, this specific statement illustrates the language of the cohesive cluster.

Crucially, these two clusters are not independent but are strongly antagonistic. For example, `Tribal Dominance` raw score is strongly negatively correlated with `Individual Dignity` salience (`r` = -0.893), and `Fragmentative Goals` salience is perfectly negatively correlated with `Compersion` salience (`r` = -1.00). This confirms that, in this dataset, these two rhetorical meta-strategies are treated as mutually exclusive choices.

| Dimension 1                      | Dimension 2                      | Correlation (r) |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Within Fragmentative Cluster** |                                  |                 |
| Tribal Dominance Raw             | Fear Raw                         | 0.996           |
| Enmity Raw                       | Envy Raw                         | 0.982           |
| **Within Cohesive Cluster**      |                                  |                 |
| Amity Raw                        | Cohesive Goals Raw               | 0.999           |
| Individual Dignity Salience      | Cohesive Goals Salience          | 0.899           |
| **Between Opposing Dimensions**  |                                  |                 |
| Compersion Salience              | Tribal Dominance Salience        | -1.000          |
| Envy Raw                         | Compersion Raw                   | -0.975          |
| Fragmentative Goals Raw          | Individual Dignity Salience      | -0.810          |

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns observed provide strong, albeit preliminary, support for the theoretical underpinnings of the CFF. The framework is designed to measure opposing rhetorical pulls, and the correlation matrix validates this construct. The stark negative correlation between `Envy` and `Compersion` (`r` = -0.98) or `Fear` and `Hope` (raw scores, `r` = -0.57) demonstrates that these are indeed treated as rhetorical opposites in practice.

The analysis also reveals how these dimensions bundle together into meta-strategies. The fragmenting strategy appears to be a rhetoric of threatened identity. It combines a focus on `Tribal Dominance` with `Fear` of the "other," `Enmity` toward that other, and `Envy` of their perceived gains, all in service of `Fragmentative Goals`. This is a classic populist-nationalist rhetorical structure. The cohesive strategy, in contrast, is a rhetoric of universal dignity. It links the value of the `Individual` to `Amity` (goodwill to all) and `Hope` for a shared future, in service of `Cohesive Goals`.

An interesting and unexpected finding is the perfect negative correlation (`r` = -1.00) between the salience of `Compersion` (joy in others' success) and the salience of both `Tribal Dominance` and `Fragmentative Goals`. This suggests that `Compersion` is not merely the absence of `Envy` but may be a powerful indicator of a worldview fundamentally incompatible with group-based dominance and zero-sum thinking.

The tension between these strategies is visible even within a single speaker. For example, Steve King's speech scores very high on `Tribal Dominance` and `Enmity`, yet it contains statements appealing to universal principles, such as when he says, `"That being one of God's children is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody treated equally"` (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). The CFF is able to capture this contradiction: the speech scores 0.1 on `Individual Dignity` raw score despite this statement, because the overwhelming weight of the text points in the opposite, tribalistic direction. This demonstrates the framework's ability to see past isolated statements to the dominant rhetorical thrust of a document.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this pilot analysis, the CFF demonstrates considerable effectiveness in several key areas.

**Discriminatory Power:** The framework shows excellent discriminatory power. The wide variance in both the base dimensions and the final `Full Cohesion Index` (`SD` = 0.67) indicates that the CFF is highly sensitive to rhetorical differences between documents. It successfully differentiated the four texts into distinct profiles, avoiding the "middle-ground" flattening that can occur with less sensitive instruments.

**Framework-Corpus Fit:** The statistical patterns align remarkably well with the CFF's theoretical design. The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions and the clustering of cohesive and fragmentative dimensions into coherent meta-strategies suggest a strong fit between the framework's constructs and the rhetorical patterns present in the corpus. The framework did not produce anomalous or uninterpretable results; instead, it uncovered a clear, underlying structure in the discourse.

**Methodological Insights:** The analysis highlights the value of the CFF's unique features. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` proved to be a useful and non-obvious metric, capturing a layer of rhetorical complexity related to mixed messaging that is distinct from overall cohesion. Furthermore, the use of salience-weighting in the Cohesion Indices appears to be a critical innovation, providing a more robust measure of a document's rhetorical impact than raw intensity scores alone.

## 6. Discussion

### Theoretical Implications and Archetypal Patterns

While caution is warranted due to the small sample size, the findings from this pilot study have several interesting theoretical implications. The clear bifurcation of the corpus into cohesive and fragmentative rhetorical strategies suggests that political discourse may be organized around two fundamental, competing logics. One logic, rooted in universalism and positive-sum thinking (`Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, `Hope`), aims to expand the circle of belonging. The other, rooted in particularism and zero-sum thinking (`Tribal Dominance`, `Enmity`, `Fear`), aims to police the boundaries of a threatened in-group.

This analysis allows for the preliminary identification of rhetorical archetypes:
1.  **The Unifier (McCain):** Characterized by very high cohesion, very low fragmentation, and minimal strategic contradiction. This style is consistent, clear, and focused on bridging divides.
2.  **The Divider (King):** Characterized by very high fragmentation, very low cohesion, and minimal strategic contradiction. This style is also consistent and clear, but its purpose is to reinforce in-group boundaries and stoke conflict with out-groups.
3.  **The Populist Agitator (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez):** Characterized by high scores on both fragmentative dimensions (e.g., `Enmity`, `Envy` directed at an elite out-group) and cohesive dimensions (e.g., `Amity`, `Cohesive Goals` for the in-group). This leads to negative-to-moderate overall cohesion scores and, notably, higher levels of strategic contradiction. This archetype's complexity is precisely what the CFF is designed to capture.

### Limitations and Future Directions

The primary and most significant limitation of this study is its sample size of four documents. This prevents any form of statistical generalization, and all correlational findings must be viewed as descriptive observations of this dataset alone. The absence of a corpus manifest also prevented a more systematic analysis of speaker characteristics.

However, the clarity of the findings, even with N=4, provides a strong foundation for future research. This pilot study generates several testable hypotheses:
*   **H1:** Across a larger, more diverse corpus of political speech, the "Cohesive" and "Fragmentative" rhetorical clusters identified in this analysis will remain stable and negatively correlated.
*   **H2:** Political speeches classified as "populist" will, on average, exhibit a significantly higher `Strategic Contradiction Index` than speeches classified as "establishment" or "centrist."
*   **H3:** The `Full Cohesion Index` will be a significant negative predictor of real-world indicators of political polarization and social strife in subsequent time periods.
*   **H4:** The `Compersion` dimension will consistently emerge as one of the strongest negative correlates of `Tribal Dominance` and other fragmentative dimensions, suggesting it is a key marker of a cohesive worldview.

Future work should apply the CFF to a large, diachronic corpus of political texts to test these hypotheses and track the evolution of these rhetorical patterns over time.

## 7. Conclusion

This preliminary computational analysis, despite its limited scope, successfully demonstrates the analytical power and theoretical coherence of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.1. By moving beyond simple valence to measure complex, co-occurring rhetorical appeals, the CFF uncovered a deeply polarized rhetorical landscape within the four-document corpus, identifying two distinct and antagonistic meta-strategies. The framework's novel metrics, particularly the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, proved effective at quantifying both the overall pro-social orientation and the internal consistency of a text.

The analysis provided strong preliminary evidence for the framework's construct validity, as its oppositional dimensions were empirically confirmed through strong negative correlations. While no generalizable claims can be made from this pilot study, the results serve as a robust proof-of-concept. They yield a set of clear, testable hypotheses about the structure of political rhetoric that warrant further investigation with larger datasets. The CFF appears to be a promising and sophisticated tool for researchers seeking to understand the complex ways in which language can be used to either knit together or tear apart the social fabric.
