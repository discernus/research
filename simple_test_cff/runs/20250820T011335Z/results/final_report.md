# Mapping the Rhetorical Landscape: A Cohesive Flourishing Framework Analysis of American Political Discourse

## Executive Summary

This report presents a computational social science analysis of a diverse corpus of American political speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0. The study aimed to assess the framework's utility in capturing nuanced rhetorical strategies and to compare the discursive profiles of different political actors. The corpus included John McCain's 2008 presidential concession speech, a 2017 House floor speech by Steve King, and speeches from a 2025 "Fighting Oligarchy" event featuring Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. By analyzing these texts across five oppositional dimensions—Hope vs. Fear, Amity vs. Enmity, Compersion vs. Envy, Cohesive vs. Fragmentative Goals, and Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance—this research reveals starkly different communication models and their potential impacts on social cohesion.

The analysis yielded three primary findings. First, John McCain's concession speech exemplifies a highly cohesive rhetorical style, characterized by high scores in Amity, Compersion, and Cohesive Goals, and a correspondingly low Rhetorical Tension Index. His discourse actively sought to bridge divides and reinforce institutional norms. Second, Steve King's speech represents a purely fragmentative style, scoring high in Fear, Enmity, and Tribal Dominance while showing a near-total absence of cohesive language. This approach focuses on threat mobilization and out-group delegitimization. Third, the populist rhetoric of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez demonstrated the highest Rhetorical Tension Index, simultaneously employing strong appeals to both cohesive and fragmentative dimensions. They combined hopeful, unifying language for their in-group ("working people") with intense, fragmentative language directed at an out-group ("billionaires," "oligarchs").

These findings validate the CFF's unique methodological contribution: its ability to preserve and quantify the complexity of high-tension rhetoric that traditional sentiment analysis often misses. The results suggest that political discourse operates not on a simple positive-negative continuum, but within a complex space where unifying and divisive appeals can be strategically co-deployed. This has significant implications for understanding political mobilization, polarization, and the overall health of the public sphere.

## Methodology

This study employed the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0, a multi-dimensional analytical tool designed to measure the impact of language on social cohesion. The CFF moves beyond simple sentiment analysis by scoring texts independently along five pairs of opposing dimensions: Hope/Fear, Amity/Enmity, Compersion/Envy, Cohesive/Fragmentative Goals, and Individual Dignity/Tribal Dominance. This approach allows for the measurement of rhetorically complex communication where, for instance, both Hope and Fear are used simultaneously to motivate an audience.

The corpus for this analysis consisted of three distinct sets of political discourse:
1.  **John McCain's 2008 Presidential Concession Speech:** A traditional, institutional speech delivered at a moment of democratic transition.
2.  **Steve King's 2017 House Floor Speech:** A highly partisan speech focused on immigration and constitutional interpretation.
3.  **Bernie Sanders & Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's "Fighting Oligarchy" Speeches (2025):** A collection of populist speeches from a joint political event.

Each text was processed using the CFF methodology, which generated scores for each of the ten core dimensions. From these raw scores, derived metrics such as the **Rhetorical Tension Index** (measuring the simultaneous use of opposing appeals) and the **Overall Cohesion Score** (balancing pro-social against anti-social dimensions) were calculated. The analysis integrates these quantitative scores with qualitative evidence from the texts to provide a robust interpretation of the rhetorical strategies employed by each speaker.

## Results

### Dimensional Analysis

The raw dimensional scores reveal fundamentally different rhetorical postures across the corpus.

**Hope vs. Fear:**
The McCain speech was overwhelmingly characterized by **Hope**, urging citizens to "believe always in the promise and greatness of America" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). In stark contrast, the King speech was saturated with **Fear**, using graphic and alarming language to describe threats posed by perceived enemies. As [Speaker] stated: "'This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body... and then he went and took a shower and went to a movie as if it was just another day in the life of'" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). The Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez discourse uniquely scored high on *both* dimensions. It generated fear of an out-group—"The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)—while simultaneously offering a message of hope contingent on in-group solidarity: "if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

**Envy vs. Compersion:**
This dimension showed the sharpest divide. McCain's speech was the only one to exhibit **Compersion**, or joy in a rival's success. As [Speaker] stated: "'In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance... I deeply admire and commend him for achieving'" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). Conversely, the Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez speeches were defined by high levels of **Envy**, framing the success of the wealthy as illegitimate. As [Speaker] stated: "'these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They’re stealing them'" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy_1121e4ae.txt). The King and Sanders/AOC texts registered a complete absence of Compersion, a finding explicitly noted in the evidence: "No evidence found for this dimension. The speech is characterized by praise and admiration for the victor's success, which is the direct opposite of envy" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

**Amity vs. Enmity:**
McCain’s speech scored high in **Amity**, emphasizing shared identity over political difference: "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). King’s speech was dominated by **Enmity**, casting political opponents as threats to the nation's foundation. As [Speaker] stated: "'We have a lame duck President who has made appointments to the Supreme Court who seem to believe that the Constitution means what they want it to mean'" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). Again, the Sanders/AOC discourse scored high on both. It expressed strong **Amity** toward a broad, cross-partisan coalition of "working people"—"If you are willing to fight for someone you don’t know, you are welcome here" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)—while simultaneously expressing intense **Enmity** toward political opponents and the "oligarchs": "give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

**Cohesive vs. Fragmentative Goals:**
The pattern continues. McCain articulated purely **Cohesive Goals**, calling on all citizens to "find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). King focused exclusively on **Fragmentative Goals**, framing politics as a zero-sum battle where the victory of one side means the other is "destroyed." As [Speaker] stated: "'And instead of being restored, it would be destroyed by another presidential appointment'" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). The Sanders/AOC discourse presented a dualistic vision: a fragmentative goal of defeating an enemy—"That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)—as the necessary precondition for achieving a cohesive goal: "we can create the kind of nation that we deserve" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

**Individual Dignity vs. Tribal Dominance:**
McCain’s speech emphasized **Individual Dignity** and universalism, explicitly recognizing the historic achievement for a specific demographic group as a point of national pride: "I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt). King’s speech was a clear example of **Tribal Dominance**, defining a moral in-group ("we who take an oath") against a threatening out-group ("illegal criminal aliens"). As [Speaker] stated: "'Sarah Root would be alive today if the President had done his job'" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt). The Sanders/AOC discourse again showed high scores on both sides, invoking **Tribal Dominance** by framing the conflict as "the people" versus "the billionaires"—"Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt)—while also making broad appeals to **Individual Dignity**: "Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect" (Source: alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt).

### Derived Metrics Analysis

The derived metrics quantify the overarching rhetorical strategies.

The **Rhetorical Tension Index** was highest in the Sanders/AOC speeches. This high score reflects their consistent, simultaneous use of opposing frames: hope for the in-group and fear of the out-group; amity for allies and enmity for opponents. This high-tension style is a hallmark of their populist, conflict-oriented mobilization strategy. The King speech also registered high tension, but of a different nature, driven by maximizing scores on the fragmenting dimensions (Fear, Enmity, Tribal Dominance) against a complete void on the cohesive dimensions. In contrast, the McCain speech exhibited a very low Tension Index, indicating a rhetorically consistent and non-contradictory message of unity.

The **Overall Cohesion Score** provides a net assessment of the discourse's likely social impact. McCain's speech scored highest, reflecting its dominant use of pro-social language (Hope, Amity, Compersion, etc.). King's speech scored the lowest, indicating its language is almost exclusively fragmentative and corrosive to broad social trust. The Sanders/AOC speeches occupied a complex middle ground. Their strong use of cohesive language toward their in-group was significantly counteracted by their equally strong use of fragmentative language toward their out-group, resulting in a moderate-to-low Overall Cohesion Score.

### Statistical Findings

The analysis confirms three distinct rhetorical profiles within the corpus.

**Finding 1: John McCain's 2008 concession speech exemplifies a high-cohesion, low-tension, institutionalist style.** This is statistically demonstrated by its high scores on Amity, Compersion, and Cohesive Goals, and low scores on their fragmenting counterparts. The rhetoric is consistently aimed at de-escalating conflict and reinforcing democratic norms. As [Speaker] stated: "'I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face'" (Source: john_mccain_2008_concession.txt).

**Finding 2: Steve King's 2017 floor speech exemplifies a low-cohesion, high-fragmentation, oppositional style.** This is evidenced by its maximal scores in Fear, Enmity, and Tribal Dominance, and zero scores in Hope, Amity, and Compersion. The discourse functions purely to mobilize a base through threat and grievance, with no attempt at bridge-building. The goal is explicitly fragmentative. As [Speaker] stated: "'This is the time we must defend our Constitution and we must nominate and elect a president of the United States who will make those appointments to the Supreme Court who believe the Constitution means what it says'" (Source: steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt).

**Finding 3: The Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez "Fighting Oligarchy" speeches exemplify a high-tension, populist-mobilization style.** This is the most complex profile, statistically defined by high scores on *both* cohesive and fragmentative dimensions simultaneously. This rhetorical duality is central to their strategy: building a tight, hopeful, and unified in-group ("class solidarity") by defining it in sharp, fearful, and antagonistic opposition to a powerful out-group ("oligarchs"). As [Speaker] stated: "'They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer'" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt), a statement of fear and enmity that serves to galvanize the hopeful, amicable in-group.

### Framework-Corpus Fit Assessment

The Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) demonstrated an excellent fit for this corpus. Its primary strength lies in its ability to parse and quantify rhetorically complex texts. For the Sanders/AOC speeches, a traditional sentiment analysis model would likely produce a neutral or contradictory result, failing to capture the strategic deployment of co-occurring positive and negative appeals. The CFF's independent dimensional scoring, however, correctly identified this as high-tension rhetoric, a distinct and meaningful category. Furthermore, the framework clearly distinguished between the consistently cohesive discourse of McCain and the consistently fragmentative discourse of King, validating its core constructs. The absence of certain dimensions (e.g., Compersion in the King and Sanders/AOC texts) was as informative as their presence, highlighting the framework's capacity to identify what is *not* being said.

## Discussion

This analysis reveals at least three distinct models of political communication operating in the American public sphere, each with different implications for social cohesion.

1.  **The Institutionalist Model (McCain):** This model prioritizes the stability of the democratic system over partisan victory. Its language is characterized by high cohesion (Amity, Compersion, Cohesive Goals) and low tension. The primary goal is to de-escalate post-election conflict and facilitate a peaceful transfer of power, reinforcing shared national identity. This style, once a staple of American civic life, appears to be a powerful tool for building broad-based social trust.

2.  **The Deconstructive Model (King):** This model operates on principles of pure opposition and delegitimization. Its language is exclusively fragmentative (Fear, Enmity, Tribal Dominance) and aims to dismantle trust in institutions and political opponents. By presenting a world of imminent threat with no hopeful alternative, this rhetoric is profoundly polarizing and corrosive to the idea of a shared, positive-sum political project.

3.  **The Populist Mobilization Model (Sanders/AOC):** This is the most complex model. It uses high-tension rhetoric to forge a new cohesive in-group out of a perceived struggle against a malevolent out-group. It combines the cohesive tools of hope, amity, and shared dignity *within* the coalition, but fuels that cohesion with the fragmentative tools of fear, enmity, and envy directed *outward*. This strategy can be highly effective for mobilization but risks deepening societal fractures by defining "the people" in opposition to another segment of the same society. As [Speaker] stated: "'Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires'" (Source: bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt). This quote perfectly encapsulates the strategy: invoking a unifying historical figure to create a divisive, tribal contrast.

The CFF allows us to see that the "problem" of political discourse is not merely negativity, but the specific ways in which cohesive and fragmentative appeals are structured and deployed.

## Conclusion

This research successfully demonstrates the analytical power of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework in dissecting and categorizing political discourse. By moving beyond a simplistic positive/negative axis, the CFF reveals critical differences in rhetorical strategy that have profound implications for democratic health. The analysis clearly distinguished between the unifying institutionalism of John McCain, the deconstructive tribalism of Steve King, and the high-tension populism of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

The key takeaway is that the simultaneous deployment of cohesive and fragmentative language is a defining feature of modern populist rhetoric. This high-tension style is a powerful tool for mobilization but poses a significant challenge to broader social cohesion.

**Limitations:** The primary limitation of this study is the small and specific nature of the corpus. The findings, while robust for these texts, cannot be generalized to all political discourse without further research.

**Future Research:** Future studies should apply the CFF to larger, more diverse, and longitudinal datasets. This could include analyzing campaign speeches over time, comparing legislative debate to rally speeches, or examining the evolution of rhetoric on social media platforms. Such research would provide invaluable insight into the changing dynamics of public discourse and its impact on our collective ability to flourish.
