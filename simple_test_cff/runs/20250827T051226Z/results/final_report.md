## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a preliminary computational analysis of four political speeches from the Democratic Discourse Corpus using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1. The analysis reveals distinct rhetorical patterns that differentiate institutional from populist discourse. The findings, while based on a small sample (N=4), suggest that the CFF is effective in capturing nuanced linguistic strategies related to social cohesion. The institutional text, John McCain's 2008 concession speech, scored exceptionally high on the `Full Cohesion Index` (*M* = 0.76), characterized by strong appeals to `Individual Dignity`, `Hope`, and `Amity`. In stark contrast, the populist speeches from Steve King, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez all registered negative cohesion scores, indicating a greater reliance on fragmentative rhetoric.

The analysis identified a clear "Populist Rhetorical Signature" across both conservative and progressive speakers, marked by high `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, `Enmity`, and `Fragmentative Goals`. For instance, the correlation between `Fear` and `Enmity` was nearly perfect (*r* = .989), indicating that in this corpus, appeals to fear are almost invariably linked to defining an enemy. The CFF's novel "Tension Indices" further illuminated these strategies; populist speeches exhibited significantly higher `Strategic Contradiction`, suggesting a deliberate use of competing appeals. For example, the speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez combined high `Enmity` towards an "oligarch" out-group with high `Amity` towards a "working class" in-group.

Methodologically, this pilot study provides initial support for the CFF's construct validity. The strong negative correlations between opposing dimensions (e.g., `Hope` vs. `Fear`, *r* = -.928) align with the framework's theoretical design. The framework demonstrated strong discriminatory power, clearly distinguishing the cohesive, institutional style from the fragmentative, populist style. These preliminary results underscore the CFF's potential as a sophisticated tool for analyzing political discourse and suggest that future research with a larger, more diverse corpus is warranted to validate these archetypal patterns.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **A Clear Rhetorical Divide:** The analysis reveals a stark bifurcation between institutional and populist discourse. John McCain's institutional speech was overwhelmingly cohesive (`Full Cohesion Index` = 0.76), while all three populist speeches—from Steve King, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—were fragmentative, with cohesion scores of -0.77, -0.47, and -0.25, respectively.

*   **The Populist Signature:** A consistent rhetorical pattern emerged across the populist speakers, characterized by a strong reliance on fragmentative dimensions. This is evidenced by the near-perfect positive correlation between `Tribal Dominance` and `Fragmentative Goals` (*r* = .998) and the extremely high correlation between `Fear` and `Enmity` (*r* = .989), suggesting a strategy of mobilizing a base through fear of a common enemy.

*   **Strategic Contradiction as a Populist Tool:** The populist speeches exhibited significantly higher scores on the `Strategic Contradiction Index` (e.g., Sanders *M* = 0.136) compared to the institutional speech (McCain *M* = 0.021). This indicates a sophisticated use of simultaneous, contradictory appeals—for example, combining high `Enmity` towards an out-group with high `Amity` towards an in-group—a pattern observed in the speeches of both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.

*   **Framework Construct Validity:** The CFF demonstrates strong preliminary evidence of construct validity. Opposing dimensions within the framework were strongly and negatively correlated, as theoretically expected. For example, `Hope` and `Fear` showed a correlation of *r* = -.928, while `Individual Dignity` and `Tribal Dominance` had a correlation of *r* = -.622.

*   **Cohesive Rhetoric Relies on Dignity and Hope:** The highly cohesive speech by John McCain was defined by its emphasis on positive, unifying dimensions. The analysis shows that `Full Cohesion` is most strongly correlated with appeals to `Cohesive Goals` (*r* = .938), `Individual Dignity` (*r* = .777), and `Hope` (*r* = .835), indicating that cohesive language focuses on shared aspirations and respect for individuals over group identity.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1, a tool designed for the nuanced analysis of political and social discourse. The CFF moves beyond simple sentiment analysis by scoring texts along five key oppositional dimensions:
1.  **Identity:** `Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`
2.  **Emotion:** `Fear` vs. `Hope`
3.  **Success:** `Envy` vs. `Compersion`
4.  **Relation:** `Enmity` vs. `Amity`
5.  **Goals:** `Fragmentative Goals` vs. `Cohesive Goals`

For each dimension, the framework measures both the raw score (intensity) and salience (emphasis). This dual-measurement system allows for the calculation of novel derived metrics, including **Tension Indices** (quantifying the use of contradictory appeals) and a composite **Full Cohesion Index**, which provides a holistic score of a text's likely impact on social cohesion, ranging from -1.0 (highly fragmentative) to +1.0 (highly cohesive).

### Corpus Description
The analysis was conducted on the **Democratic Discourse Corpus**, a small, targeted collection of four documents spanning from 2008 to a hypothetical 2025. The corpus was selected to provide contrasting examples of political rhetoric:
*   **Institutional:** John McCain (Republican, 2008 Concession Speech)
*   **Populist Conservative:** Steve King (Republican, 2017 House Floor Speech)
*   **Populist Progressive:** Bernie Sanders (Independent, 2025 Speech)
*   **Populist Progressive:** Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Democratic, 2025 Speech)

### Statistical Methods
The analysis relied on the statistical results provided in the research data. The primary methods included:
1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of means, standard deviations, and ranges for all CFF dimensions and derived metrics to establish baseline characteristics of the corpus.
2.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation matrix was computed to identify the relationships between all CFF dimensions. This is crucial for assessing the framework's internal consistency and for uncovering rhetorical meta-strategies.
3.  **Derived Metric Analysis:** Interpretation of the CFF's unique indices, including the `Full Cohesion Index` and the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, to identify outlier documents and overarching rhetorical patterns.

### Analytical Constraints and Limitations
The foremost limitation of this study is its extremely small sample size (N=4). Consequently, the findings should be considered **preliminary and illustrative**, not generalizable. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the analytical potential of the CFF and to generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research. All interpretations are presented with this significant constraint in mind. Furthermore, the analysis relies solely on the provided statistical data and curated textual evidence; no external information was used.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An analysis of the corpus reveals wide variance in rhetorical strategies. The mean `Full Cohesion Index` for the corpus was slightly negative (*M* = -0.18, *SD* = 0.66), but this average obscures a clear divide. As shown in Table 1, John McCain's speech is a strong positive outlier (*M* = 0.76), while the other three speeches are negative outliers, with Steve King's being the most fragmentative (*M* = -0.77).

Similarly, the `Strategic Contradiction Index`, which measures rhetorical tension, shows a higher average among the populist speakers (*M* = 0.085) compared to the institutional speaker (*M* = 0.021). This suggests that populist rhetoric in this sample is more likely to employ competing emotional and identity-based appeals simultaneously.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key Derived CFF Metrics**

| Metric                          | Mean   | SD     | Min    | Max    |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Full Cohesion Index             | -0.182 | 0.664  | -0.771 | 0.760  |
| Strategic Contradiction Index   | 0.069  | 0.050  | 0.021  | 0.136  |
| Identity Tension                | 0.093  | 0.069  | 0.000  | 0.150  |
| Emotional Tension               | 0.140  | 0.031  | 0.105  | 0.180  |
| Relational Tension              | 0.059  | 0.096  | 0.000  | 0.200  |

*Note: N=4. Statistics are rounded to three decimal places.*

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Cohesion and Contradiction

The `Full Cohesion Index` effectively discriminates between rhetorical styles. The outlier analysis identifies John McCain's 2008 concession as the highest-scoring document for cohesion. Its profile is defined by high scores in `Individual Dignity` (*M* = 0.80), `Hope` (*M* = 0.85), `Amity` (*M* = 0.90), and `Cohesive Goals` (*M* = 0.95), with negligible scores in their fragmentative counterparts.

Conversely, the lowest cohesion score belongs to Steve King's 2017 speech. This text is characterized by high scores in `Tribal Dominance` (*M* = 0.80), `Fear` (*M* = 0.90), and `Enmity` (*M* = 0.90). This rhetorical strategy is vividly illustrated by his graphic description of a crime committed by an immigrant. As Steve King stated: **"This illegal alien beat this boy to death and then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body. He hauled his body out and and put gas and poured gasoline on it and burned this Joshua Wilkerson's ..."** (Source: `steve_king_2017_house_floor.txt`). This quote exemplifies language that scores high on both `Fear` and `Enmity`, driving down the overall cohesion score.

The `Strategic Contradiction Index` reveals a more subtle aspect of populist rhetoric. Bernie Sanders' speech scores highest on this index (*M* = 0.136), driven by significant tension across identity, emotional, and relational dimensions. His speech combines strong `Enmity` towards an out-group with strong `Amity` towards an in-group. For example, he defines a clear enemy, stating, **"...in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs"** (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). Simultaneously, he fosters in-group solidarity, urging followers to **"stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart"** (Source: `bernie_sanders_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This dual-pronged approach, attacking an out-group while unifying an in-group, is a classic populist strategy that the CFF's tension metrics are designed to detect.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals the underlying structure of the rhetorical strategies within this corpus and provides strong support for the CFF's design. As shown in Table 2, opposing dimensions are, without exception, negatively correlated, suggesting strong construct validity.

The strongest positive correlations highlight key "meta-strategies." The near-perfect correlation between `Tribal Dominance` and `Fragmentative Goals` (*r* = .998) suggests that, in this dataset, appeals to in-group identity are fundamentally linked to goals that involve defeating or removing an out-group. This is exemplified in the rhetoric of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which combines appeals to a specific class-based tribe with explicit calls to remove political opponents. As Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated: **"give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them"** (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This statement directly reflects a fragmentative goal rooted in a tribal "us vs. them" worldview.

Conversely, `Full Cohesion` is most strongly and positively correlated with `Cohesive Goals` (*r* = .938) and `Individual Dignity` (*r* = .777). This indicates that language aiming to build broad social cohesion tends to focus on shared, positive future outcomes and the inherent worth of every individual, rather than on group-based identities.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns suggest the existence of two primary rhetorical archetypes in this corpus: **Institutional Cohesion** and **Populist Fragmentation**.

The **Institutional Cohesion** archetype, exemplified by John McCain, is a low-tension, high-cohesion strategy. It avoids strong negative emotions and tribal appeals, instead focusing on `Hope`, `Amity`, and `Individual Dignity`. Its goals are explicitly cohesive, aiming to unite a broad audience. The near-zero scores on all tension indices for this speech indicate a consistent, non-contradictory message. No supporting textual evidence was found for this statistical pattern in the curated list, highlighting a potential area for deeper qualitative analysis in future work.

The **Populist Fragmentation** archetype is a high-tension, low-cohesion strategy shared by King, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez. This style thrives on defining a virtuous, tribal in-group against a corrupt, powerful out-group. This is achieved through a synergistic use of `Fear`, `Enmity`, and `Tribal Dominance`. The goals are inherently fragmentative, often centered on defeating the out-group. The rhetoric of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shows how this can be combined with cohesive appeals to a specific subgroup, as she calls for **"class solidarity"** while simultaneously targeting political opponents (Source: `alexandria_ocasio_cortez_2025_fighting_oligarchy.txt`). This complex layering of fragmentative and cohesive appeals to different audiences is precisely what the CFF's tension metrics are designed to capture.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

Based on this preliminary analysis, the CFF demonstrates notable effectiveness in several areas:

1.  **Discriminatory Power:** The framework, particularly through its `Full Cohesion Index`, clearly and effectively differentiated the institutional speech from the three populist speeches. The wide range of scores on this index (-0.77 to +0.76) indicates that the metric is sensitive to significant variations in rhetorical style.

2.  **Construct Validity:** The strong negative correlations between theoretically opposing dimensions (e.g., `Hope` vs. `Fear`, `Amity` vs. `Enmity`) provide initial support for the framework's internal logic and structure. These results align with the CFF's design as an oppositional framework.

3.  **Detection of Nuance:** The CFF successfully captured the complex, dual-natured rhetoric of the progressive populist speakers. By scoring both `Amity` and `Enmity` (or `Cohesive Goals` and `Fragmentative Goals`) independently, the framework revealed how Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez could simultaneously build in-group solidarity while fostering out-group hostility—a nuance that simpler, unidimensional sentiment models would likely miss. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` provides a quantitative measure of this sophisticated rhetorical strategy.

## 6. Discussion

The findings from this pilot study, while limited by the small sample size, offer significant theoretical and methodological implications. The clear distinction between an "Institutional Cohesion" style and a "Populist Fragmentation" style suggests the existence of durable rhetorical archetypes that may transcend partisan divides. The fact that a conservative populist (King) and two progressive populists (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) share a core rhetorical signature—high `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, and `Enmity`—is a key finding. This suggests that the *structure* of populist rhetoric may be more consistent than its specific ideological *content*.

The progressive populist variant, however, appears more complex than its conservative counterpart in this sample. The speeches by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez demonstrate higher `Strategic Contradiction`, blending fragmentative attacks on "oligarchs" with cohesive appeals to "class solidarity." This suggests a strategy aimed at simultaneously mobilizing a base (fragmentation) and articulating a positive, alternative vision (cohesion). This contrasts with the more singularly focused fragmentative rhetoric of the Steve King example. Future research should investigate whether this distinction holds across a larger sample of populist texts.

Methodologically, this analysis serves as a proof-of-concept for the Cohesive Flourishing Framework. Its ability to quantify not just the presence of certain themes but also the *tension* between them represents a valuable innovation in discourse analysis. The `Strategic Contradiction Index` offers a novel way to measure rhetorical sophistication and potential cognitive dissonance in political messaging.

The primary limitation remains the N=4 sample. These findings are hypotheses, not conclusions. Future research is essential to validate these patterns. A larger corpus would allow for more robust statistical analysis, including regression modeling to determine which CFF dimensions are the strongest predictors of overall cohesion. A diachronic (time-series) analysis could also track how the rhetoric of specific political actors or movements evolves over time.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of the Democratic Discourse Corpus, guided by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework, has successfully identified distinct and theoretically meaningful rhetorical patterns. Despite the significant limitation of a small sample size, the analysis demonstrates the CFF's capacity to move beyond surface-level sentiment and reveal the deeper structural mechanics of political language.

The study's key contribution is the preliminary identification of two opposing rhetorical archetypes: a low-tension, high-cohesion institutional style and a high-tension, low-cohesion populist style. The findings suggest that the structure of populist rhetoric—characterized by a synergy of `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, and `Enmity`—may be a consistent feature across the ideological spectrum.

Methodologically, the CFF has shown promise. Its oppositional design appears valid, and its novel tension metrics provide a quantitative handle on sophisticated strategies like strategic contradiction. This pilot study provides a strong justification for applying the CFF to larger, more diverse corpora to test the generalizability of these initial findings and further explore the linguistic drivers of social cohesion and fragmentation.
