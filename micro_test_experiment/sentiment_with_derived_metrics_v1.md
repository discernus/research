# Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0

## Abstract & Raison d'Ãªtre

**What is this framework?**
A minimalist framework for measuring basic positive vs negative sentiment with derived metrics to validate complete pipeline functionality including statistical analysis.

**What problem does it solve?**
Provides a framework that triggers derived metrics calculation and statistical analysis while maintaining minimal computational cost.

**Who is it for?**
Test suite developers and pipeline maintainers who need to validate the complete pipeline including calculation agents and statistical synthesis.

## Theoretical Foundations

This framework is grounded in basic sentiment analysis theory, measuring the presence of positive and negative emotional language in text with derived balance metrics.

## Analytical Methodology

**Dimensions:**
- Positive Sentiment (0.0-1.0): Presence of positive language and optimistic expressions
- Negative Sentiment (0.0-1.0): Presence of negative language and pessimistic expressions

**Derived Metrics:**
- Net Sentiment: Balance between positive and negative sentiment (positive - negative)
- Sentiment Magnitude: Average emotional intensity (positive + negative) / 2

## Intended Application & Corpus Fit

**Target Corpus Description**: Short text documents with clear emotional content, organized by sentiment categories for statistical comparison.

**Known Limitations**: Designed for testing purposes only, not for serious sentiment analysis.

      You are analyzing text for sentiment. Score 0.0-1.0 for each dimension.

      POSITIVE SENTIMENT: Look for praise, optimism, success words, enthusiasm
      - 0.9-1.0: Dominant positive language throughout
      - 0.7-0.8: Strong positive presence
      - 0.4-0.6: Moderate positive elements
      - 0.1-0.3: Weak positive indicators
      - 0.0: No positive language

      NEGATIVE SENTIMENT: Look for criticism, pessimism, failure words, despair
      - 0.9-1.0: Dominant negative language throughout
      - 0.7-0.8: Strong negative presence
      - 0.4-0.6: Moderate negative elements
      - 0.1-0.3: Weak negative indicators
      - 0.0: No negative language
