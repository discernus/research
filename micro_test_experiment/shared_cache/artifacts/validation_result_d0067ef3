      "description": "The experiment requests an ANOVA with group sizes of n=2. This violates the platform's statistical power requirements, which state that ANOVA requires a minimum of 5 documents per group and that hypothesis testing is inappropriate for a total sample size of N<10. The current N=4 is only suitable for qualitative case study analysis.",
      "impact": "The experiment will be blocked from execution. Proceeding with an ANOVA on this data would produce statistically invalid and misleading results due to a severe lack of statistical power, making it impossible to answer the research questions regarding 'significant differences'.",
      "fix": "To perform an ANOVA, expand the corpus to include at least 5 documents in the 'positive' group and 5 in the 'negative' group. Alternatively, revise the research questions and 'Expected Outcomes' in experiment.md to focus on descriptive statistics and qualitative pattern analysis, which is appropriate for the current corpus size.",

The formula calculates the average intensity, not the total combined intensity.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency can cause confusion during the interpretation of results. A user reading the prose would expect a summed score, but the output will be an averaged score, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about emotional intensity.",
      "fix": "Align the prose description with the YAML formula in 'framework.md'. Either change the description to 'Combined emotional intensity (average of positive and negative scores)' or change the formula to remove the '/ 2' if a sum is the intended metric.",
