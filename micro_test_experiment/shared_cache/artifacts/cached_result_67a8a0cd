      "description": "The experiment's 'Statistical Analysis Requirements' section requests 'Reliability analysis for measurement consistency', which is not statistically meaningful or valid with the provided corpus size of N=4 (two groups of n=2).",
      "impact": "The statistical synthesis agent will be unable to perform a valid reliability analysis. While descriptive statistics will be generated, this specific analytical goal will not be met, and any attempt to compute reliability metrics like Cronbach's alpha would produce meaningless results.",
      "fix": "Remove 'Reliability analysis for measurement consistency' from the 'Statistical Analysis Requirements' in experiment.md, as it is not appropriate for a sample size of N=4. The existing goal of 'Descriptive analysis' and 'case study patterns' is appropriate for the corpus.",

The executed calculation will be the average, not the sum.",
      "impact": "There is a minor inconsistency between the framework's human-readable documentation and its machine-readable instructions. This could cause confusion for a reader, but the system will execute the formula as written in the YAML appendix (calculating the average).",
      "fix": "Update the prose in the 'Analytical Methodology' section of framework.md to state that Sentiment Magnitude is the average of the positive and negative scores, aligning it with the implemented formula.",
