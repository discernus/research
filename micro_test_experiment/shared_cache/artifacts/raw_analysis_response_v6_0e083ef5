I'll analyze the document using three independent analytical approaches as required, then aggregate the results.

**APPROACH 1 - Evidence-First Analysis:**
- Positive Sentiment: 0.9 (explicit positive words: "superb", "excited", "outstanding", "incredible", "marvelous", "delighted")
- Negative Sentiment: 0.0 (no negative language present)

**APPROACH 2 - Context-Weighted Analysis:**
- Positive Sentiment: 0.8 (strong positive theme throughout, but weighting structural balance)
- Negative Sentiment: 0.0 (complete absence of negative elements)

**APPROACH 3 - Pattern-Based Analysis:**
- Positive Sentiment: 0.9 (repetitive positive pattern with 10+ positive indicators)
- Negative Sentiment: 0.0 (no negative patterns detected)

**Median Calculations:**
- Positive Sentiment: 0.9 (median of 0.9, 0.8, 0.9)
- Negative Sentiment: 0.0 (median of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
