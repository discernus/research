      "description": "The human-readable description for the derived metric 'Sentiment Magnitude' in the framework specification is '(positive + negative)', but the machine-readable YAML formula is '(dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score + dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score) / 2'. This creates an ambiguity between the intended calculation (a sum) and the implemented calculation (an average).",
      "impact": "The analysis will run using the average, but the framework's documentation will be misleading, potentially causing misinterpretation of the 'Sentiment Magnitude' metric by future researchers.",
      "fix": "Update the human-readable description of 'Sentiment Magnitude' in 'framework.md' under the 'Derived Metrics' section to 'Combined intensity of emotional language (positive + negative) / 2' to match the YAML formula.",

      "description": "The 'Theoretical Foundations' section of the framework is minimal and lacks the required citations to academic literature or prior research. The v10.0 Framework Specification states that citations 'must' be included to support the framework's claims and establish its scholarly credibility.",
      "impact": "This reduces the scholarly validity and reusability of the framework, as its theoretical basis is not substantiated. While it does not block execution, it fails to meet the quality standards for a v10.0 framework.",
      "fix": "Expand the 'Theoretical Foundations' section in 'framework.md' to include a brief discussion of the literature it builds upon and add citations to support the dimensional definitions (e.g., references to foundational works in sentiment analysis).",

      "description": "The experiment requests 'Reliability analysis for measurement consistency' with a total sample size of N=4 (two groups of n=2). While the 'pingouin' library is available, the interpretation of any reliability metric is severely limited and potentially misleading with such a small sample. The experiment's primary focus on descriptive statistics and pattern analysis is appropriate for this sample size.",
      "impact": "The 'Reliability analysis' may produce numerically valid but scientifically questionable results, potentially leading to an over-interpretation of measurement consistency for this small-N case study.",
      "fix": "Consider re-framing the 'Reliability analysis' requirement in 'experiment.md' as an exploratory 'cross-case consistency check' or remove it to align expectations with the limitations of a 4-document corpus.",
