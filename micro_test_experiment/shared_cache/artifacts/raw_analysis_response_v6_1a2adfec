I'll analyze the document using three independent analytical approaches as required.

**STEP 1: Three Independent Analyses**

**APPROACH 1 - Evidence-First Analysis:**
- Positive Sentiment: 0.0 (no positive language present)
- Negative Sentiment: 0.9 (dominant negative language: "terrible", "awful", "failure", "horrible", "disaster", "disastrous", "devastated", "dark and hopeless")

**APPROACH 2 - Context-Weighted Analysis:**
- Positive Sentiment: 0.0 (complete absence of optimistic expressions)
- Negative Sentiment: 0.8 (strong thematic centrality of despair and failure throughout)

**APPROACH 3 - Pattern-Based Analysis:**
- Positive Sentiment: 0.0 (no repetition of positive terms)
- Negative Sentiment: 0.9 (systematic repetition of negative terms creating cumulative effect)

**STEP 2: Calculate Median Scores**
- Positive Sentiment: 0.0 (median of 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
- Negative Sentiment: 0.9 (median of 0.9, 0.8, 0.9)

**STEP 3: Select Best Evidence**
Best evidence comes from Approach 1's direct textual identification.

**STEP 4: Final Aggregated Result**
