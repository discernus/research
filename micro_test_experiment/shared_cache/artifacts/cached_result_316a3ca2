      "description": "The experiment requests 'Reliability analysis' with a total sample size of N=4 (two groups of n=2). This sample size is statistically insufficient for any meaningful reliability calculation, violating the platform's statistical power requirements as defined in the v10.0 Experiment Specification.",
      "impact": "The statistical synthesis agent will either fail to execute the reliability analysis or produce statistically invalid and meaningless results. Platform policy prohibits executing underpowered statistical tests.",
      "fix": "Remove 'Reliability analysis for measurement consistency' from the 'Statistical Analysis Requirements' section within the `experiment.md` file. The analysis for this sample size should be limited to descriptive statistics and qualitative pattern analysis, which are appropriate for N=4.",

      "description": "The prose description of the 'Sentiment Magnitude' derived metric in the framework's narrative is inconsistent with its machine-readable implementation. The 'Analytical Methodology' section describes it as '(positive + negative)', while the `derived_metrics` YAML section defines it as the average: '(positive + negative) / 2'.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency can mislead researchers about the metric's true calculation. The analysis will use the average, which may not align with a researcher's expectation based on the narrative description.",
      "fix": "Update the narrative 'Analytical Methodology' section in the framework file (`sentiment_with_derived_metrics_v1.md`) to clarify that Sentiment Magnitude is the *average* of the positive and negative scores, aligning the prose with the YAML formula.",
