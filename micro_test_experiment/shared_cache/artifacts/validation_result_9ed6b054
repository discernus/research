      "fix": "Remove the 'hypotheses' section from 'experiment.md' or rephrase them as descriptive research questions. The experiment's scope must be limited to descriptive statistics and qualitative pattern analysis as appropriate for an N=4 corpus.",

(positive + negative)', implying a sum. However, the YAML definition and formula correctly specify an average: '(positive + negative) / 2'.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency can lead to misinterpretation of the framework by human researchers, although the machine execution will correctly use the formula. It undermines the principle of a human-first, machine-readable specification.",
