      "description": "The experiment requests 'Reliability analysis for measurement consistency'. Performing reliability analysis (e.g., Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation) on a corpus of N=4 with only two measurement dimensions is statistically invalid and will produce meaningless results.",
      "impact": "The synthesis agent will either fail to run the analysis due to insufficient data or produce a statistically unsound reliability coefficient, which could lead to incorrect conclusions about measurement consistency.",
      "fix": "Remove 'Reliability analysis for measurement consistency' from the 'Statistical Analysis Requirements' section in the experiment's prose. The analysis for this corpus size should be limited to descriptive statistics and qualitative pattern identification.",

      "impact": "The analysis may be less reliable or consistent. The AI agent will have less context, potentially leading to lower quality scoring and less relevant evidence selection.",
      "fix": "Refactor the 'analysis_prompt' in framework.md to align with the v10.0 specification's best practices. Define an expert persona (e.g., 'You are an expert in sentiment analysis...') and provide more detailed guidance, examples, and distinctions as shown in the spec.",

      "impact": "Reduces the scholarly credibility and reproducibility of the framework. While acceptable for an internal test, this would not meet the standard for a formal research experiment.",
      "fix": "For formal research, expand the 'Theoretical Foundations' section in framework.md to include a brief discussion of the underlying theory (e.g., valence-arousal models of emotion) and cite relevant academic sources.",

The human-readable 'Analytical Methodology' section describes it as a sum ('positive + negative'), while the YAML 'derived_metrics' formula correctly implements it as an average ('(positive + negative) / 2').",
      "impact": "Creates a minor inconsistency between the documented methodology and the executed calculation, which could cause confusion for a reader.",
