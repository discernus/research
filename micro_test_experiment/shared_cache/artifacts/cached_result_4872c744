      "description": "The human-readable prose description for the 'Sentiment Magnitude' derived metric in the framework's 'Analytical Methodology' section is '(positive + negative)'. This conflicts with the machine-readable YAML appendix, where the description is 'Average emotional intensity (positive + negative) / 2' and the formula is '(dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score + dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score) / 2'. The machine-readable YAML part is internally consistent, but the prose is misleading.",
      "impact": "A researcher reviewing the framework's methodology could be misled by the prose description, as it does not accurately reflect the calculation that will be performed during execution.",
      "fix": "Update the prose description for 'Sentiment Magnitude' in the 'Analytical Methodology' section of the framework file to align with the YAML definition, for instance: 'Sentiment Magnitude: The average intensity of emotional language, calculated as (positive + negative) / 2.'",
