      "description": "The corpus manifest (corpus.md) uses `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, while the experiment and framework use the current `spec_version: \"10.0\"`. While the experiment is expected to run correctly due to backward compatibility, aligning all component specifications is a best practice.",
      "impact": "The experiment will execute, but using a deprecated specification version may limit access to newer features and could cause friction in future experiments. It is a minor compliance issue.",
      "fix": "In `corpus.md`, update the `spec_version` field from `\"8.0\"` to `\"10.0\"` to align with the other experiment components.",

      "description": "The experiment's machine-readable appendix defines formal, falsifiable hypotheses (H1, H2) which typically imply inferential statistical testing. However, the corpus has a total sample size of N=4 (n=2 per group), which is insufficient for hypothesis testing. The experiment's prose correctly identifies that the analysis will be descriptive.",
      "impact": "The analysis will run successfully and generate descriptive statistics, but it will not produce statistical test results (e.g., p-values) to formally accept or reject H1 and H2. This creates a minor misalignment between the formal declaration of hypotheses and the practical analytical scope.",
      "fix": "Consider rephrasing the hypotheses to reflect a descriptive or pattern-based inquiry, or remove the `falsifiable`, `mutually_exclusive`, and `collective_exhaustive` flags to signal that they are guiding questions for descriptive exploration rather than formal statistical hypotheses.",
