      "description": "The prose description for the 'sentiment_magnitude' derived metric is ambiguous. The prose says 'Combined intensity... (positive + negative)', implying a sum, while the YAML formula correctly calculates an average: '(positive + negative) / 2'.",
      "impact": "The ambiguity between 'combined intensity' (sum) and 'average intensity' could lead to human misinterpretation of the results when reading the framework's narrative section, even though the calculation is correct.",

      "impact": "While the v8.0 format is forward-compatible and will not block execution, it is slightly outdated. Adopting the latest patch version of the specification (v8.0.2) and its preferred structure improves consistency and ensures access to the latest validation rules and features.",
      "fix": "Update the corpus manifest's 'spec_version' to '8.0.2'. While not required, consider moving top-level descriptive fields like 'date_range' into a dedicated 'metadata' block for better organization, consistent with newer examples.",

The v10.0 framework specification recommends an enhanced object structure (e.g., [{phrase: \"...\", explanation: \"...\"}]) to provide superior context to the analysis agent, which significantly improves scoring accuracy and consistency.",
      "impact": "Using the recommended structure with explanations provides clearer guidance to the LLM agent, reducing ambiguity and improving the reliability of the dimensional scores.",
