      "impact": "The system will construct an invalid path (e.g., `[project_root]/corpus/corpus/positive_test_1.txt`) and will be unable to locate the document files, causing the experiment to fail during the loading phase.",
      "fix": "In `corpus.md`, remove the `corpus/` prefix from all `filename` entries within the YAML manifest. For example, change `filename: \"corpus/positive_test_1.txt\"` to `filename: \"positive_test_1.txt\"`.",

      "description": "The corpus manifest specifies `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, but the current standard is v8.0.2. While functionally similar for this use case, using an outdated spec version can lead to missed validation checks and potential incompatibilities with future platform updates.",
      "impact": "The experiment will likely run but may not benefit from the latest features or stricter validation rules of the current corpus specification. It indicates a potential lack of review against the most recent standards.",
      "fix": "Update the `spec_version` field in the `corpus.md` YAML manifest to `\"8.0.2\"`.",

  "suggestions": [
    "In `experiment.md`, the hypotheses (H1, H2) use comparative language ('higher... than') that implies inferential statistical testing. Given the small sample size (N=4), which only permits descriptive analysis, consider rephrasing these as 'Research Expectations' or qualifying the language (e.g., '...are expected to show descriptively higher scores...') to align more closely with the stated analytical scope."
