# Micro Test Experiment

## Abstract
Complete pipeline validation with 4 documents, 2 dimensions, 2 derived metrics, and statistical analysis. Tests end-to-end integration including calculation agents and statistical synthesis with minimal computational cost.

## Research Questions
- How do sentiment categories differ in positive and negative sentiment scores?
- What are the patterns in net sentiment and sentiment magnitude across different sentiment categories?
- What descriptive patterns emerge between positive and negative sentiment groups?

## Expected Outcomes
Descriptive analysis of sentiment scores between positive and negative sentiment categories, including descriptive statistics, derived metric calculations, and pattern identification.

## Data Grouping and Custom Variable Mapping

**Primary Analysis Variable**: sentiment_category (positive vs negative)
- Two groups: positive (n=2), negative (n=2)
- Sample size N=4 suitable for descriptive analysis and case study patterns

**Statistical Analysis Requirements**:
- Descriptive statistics for all dimensions and derived metrics
- Pattern analysis between sentiment categories
- Basic measurement consistency checks (reliability analysis not feasible with N=4)
