      "description": "Hypotheses H1 and H2 are phrased using comparative language ('higher...than') which implies inferential statistical testing. However, the experiment's 'Data Grouping' section correctly states that with a sample size of N=4, only 'descriptive analysis and case study patterns' are appropriate, and the 'Statistical Analysis Requirements' section notes that reliability analysis is not feasible.",
      "impact": "This creates a mismatch between the formal hypotheses and the achievable analytical outcomes. An attempt to interpret the results as a formal test of H1 or H2 would be statistically invalid due to the extremely low sample size. The results can only be interpreted descriptively.",
      "fix": "Rephrase H1 and H2 to align with a descriptive or exploratory goal. For example: 'H1: Positive sentiment documents are expected to show descriptively higher positive sentiment scores compared to negative sentiment documents.' This clarifies that the comparison is observational, not a formal statistical test.",
