It also ensures that the scores are within the valid range of 0.0 to 1.0. This makes the function robust against incorrect inputs.\n   - **Score Extraction**: It extracts the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` values from the input dictionary for easier use.\n   - **Derived Metric Calculations**:\n     - **`net_sentiment`**: Calculated as `positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment`. This metric quantifies the overall sentiment balance. A positive value signifies a net positive sentiment, a negative value signifies a net negative sentiment, and a value of zero indicates a neutral or balanced sentiment.\n     - **`sentiment_magnitude`**: Calculated as `(positive_sentiment + negative_sentiment) / 2`. This metric represents the average intensity of expressed emotion, regardless of whether it's positive or negative. A higher magnitude suggests more pronounced emotional content in the text.\n   - **Output Formatting**: The calculated derived metrics are stored in a dictionary and returned.\n\n**2. Provided Scores:**\n   The script uses the following JSON object as input, representing the dimensional scores for a particular piece of text:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"positive_sentiment\": 0.0,\n     \"negative_sentiment\": 1.0\n   }\n   ```\n   This indicates text with no positive sentiment and maximum negative sentiment.\n\n**3. Execution and Results:**\n   The `calculate_derived_metrics` function is called with the `input_scores`. The results are then printed in a human-readable JSON format.\n\n---\n\n### Results\n\n```json\n--- Dimensional Scores ---\n{\n  \"positive_sentiment\": 0.0,\n  \"negative_sentiment\": 1.0\n}\n\n--- Calculated Derived Metrics ---\n{\n  \"net_sentiment\": -1.0,\n  \"sentiment_magnitude\": 0.5\n}\n```\n\n**Interpretation of the Results:**\n\n*   **`net_sentiment`: -1.0**\n    *   **Calculation**: `0.0 (positive_sentiment) - 1.0 (negative_sentiment) = -1.0`\n    *   **Meaning**: This result clearly indicates a strongly negative sentiment. The absence of positive sentiment and the presence of maximum negative sentiment lead to the lowest possible value for `net_sentiment`, signifying a strong negative bias.\n\n*   **`sentiment_magnitude`: 0.5**\n    *   **Calculation**: `(0.0 (positive_sentiment) + 1.0 (negative_sentiment)) / 2 = 0.5`\n    *   **Meaning**: This result suggests a moderate level of emotional intensity. While the sentiment is clearly negative, the magnitude indicates that there is a significant emotional expression present in the text, as the sum of positive and negative scores is not zero. In the context of the framework's interpretation guide (\"0.25-0.5: Moderate emotional intensity\"), this score falls within the moderate range.",
