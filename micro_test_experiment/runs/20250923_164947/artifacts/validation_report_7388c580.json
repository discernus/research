However, the corpus has a total sample size of N=4 with n=2 per group, which is insufficient for valid hypothesis testing. The analysis will be limited to descriptive statistics and qualitative pattern observation.",
      "impact": "The stated hypotheses cannot be formally tested with statistical significance. Results will be descriptive and qualitative, not inferential.",
      "fix": "Revise the research questions and hypotheses to focus exclusively on descriptive patterns and case study insights, or increase the corpus size to a minimum of N=10 for descriptive statistics or N=20+ for limited inferential testing.",
