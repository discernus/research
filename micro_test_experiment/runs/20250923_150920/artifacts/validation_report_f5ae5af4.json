      "description": "The analysis prompt in the framework uses all-caps dimension names ('POSITIVE SENTIMENT', 'NEGATIVE SENTIMENT'), while the formal `dimensions` list and `output_schema` use snake_case ('positive_sentiment', 'negative_sentiment'). This inconsistency can lead to ambiguity for the analysis agent.",
      "impact": "The analysis agent may fail to correctly map prompt instructions to the output schema, potentially leading to inconsistent or incorrect scoring. While modern agents often handle this, explicit consistency is best practice.",
      "fix": "Update the `analysis_prompt` in `framework.md` to use the official snake_case dimension names ('positive_sentiment', 'negative_sentiment') for clarity and consistency.",

      "description": "The framework's dimensions use a free-text `scoring_guide` string, whereas the v10.0 specification recommends a more structured `scoring_calibration` dictionary. The unstructured format is less precise for guiding the analysis agent.",
      "impact": "Analysis agents may interpret the scoring scale less consistently without the explicit anchoring provided by a structured calibration block, potentially reducing inter-document scoring reliability.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, consider replacing the `scoring_guide` string for each dimension with a structured `scoring_calibration` dictionary containing keys like `high`, `medium`, `low`, and `absent` with corresponding score ranges and descriptions, as shown in the v10.0 framework specification examples.",
