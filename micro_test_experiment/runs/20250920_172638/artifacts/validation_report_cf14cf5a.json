      "fix": "Update the `analysis_prompt` in `framework.md` to follow the detailed template provided in the Framework v10.0 specification, including a persona definition (e.g., 'You are an expert in sentiment analysis...'), methodology summary, and specific guidance.",

      "impact": "Using a structured `scoring_calibration` object with defined ranges (e.g., 0.9-1.0, 0.7-0.8) provides clearer guidance to the analytical agent, reducing scale drift and improving scoring consistency.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, replace the `scoring_guide` string for each dimension with a `scoring_calibration` object that defines the meaning of high, medium, low, and absent scores, as shown in the v10.0 framework specification.",
