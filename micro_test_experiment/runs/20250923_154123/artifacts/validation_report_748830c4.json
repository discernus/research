      "description": "The hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 are declared as `mutually_exclusive` and `collective_exhaustive`, but they do not meet these logical criteria. For example, a positive document having a high positive score (H1) and a negative document having a high negative score (H2) are independent events, not mutually exclusive outcomes. This affects the logical soundness of the research design narrative.",
      "impact": "The logical claims in the experiment's human-readable narrative are inconsistent, which could undermine the interpretative value of the results. This does not affect machine execution.",
      "fix": "Review the definitions of `mutually_exclusive` and `collective_exhaustive` and update the boolean flags for hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 to `false` to accurately reflect their relationship.",

      "description": "The framework's `dimensions` definitions use `min_score`, `max_score`, and a `scoring_guide` text block instead of the structured `scoring_calibration` object recommended in the v10.0 Framework specification. While the information is also present in the `analysis_prompt`, the structured format provides more reliable and consistent guidance to the analysis agent.",
      "impact": "The analysis agent may have slightly less precise scale interpretation compared to using the recommended structured format. The experiment will still execute successfully.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, replace the `scoring_guide`, `min_score`, and `max_score` fields within each dimension with a structured `scoring_calibration` object as demonstrated in the v10.0 specification examples. This will improve scoring reliability.",

      "description": "The corpus manifest (`corpus.md`) uses `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, which is older than the `spec_version: \"10.0\"` used by the experiment and framework. While the system maintains backward compatibility for this version, aligning all component specifications is a best practice for clarity and future-proofing.",
      "impact": "This version mismatch does not block execution but could lead to subtle incompatibilities or missed features from newer specifications in the future. It slightly reduces the long-term maintainability of the experiment.",
      "fix": "Update the `spec_version` in `corpus.md` to `\"10.0\"` (or the latest version) and verify the manifest structure remains compliant. The current structure appears to be forward-compatible.",

  "suggestions": [
    "The experiment correctly notes the limitations of its N=4 sample size, appropriately focusing on descriptive analysis. This aligns with platform best practices for small-N studies.",
    "While the current derived metric formulas are safe, for future frameworks with more complex calculations (e.g., ratios based on scores or salience), consider adding a small epsilon (e.g., `+ 0.001`) to denominators to prevent potential division-by-zero errors. This is a robust defensive programming practice."
