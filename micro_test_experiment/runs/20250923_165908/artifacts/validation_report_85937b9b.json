For example, it is possible for both H1 ('Positive sentiment documents show higher positive sentiment scores...') and H2 ('Negative sentiment documents show higher negative sentiment scores...') to be true simultaneously.",
      "impact": "The logical properties of the hypotheses are incorrectly defined. While this will not block execution, it represents a formal inconsistency in the research design and could lead to misinterpretation of results if automated tools rely on this metadata.",
      "fix": "Review the logical relationship between the hypotheses. Either update the flags to `mutually_exclusive: false` for each hypothesis or restructure them to be truly mutually exclusive.",
