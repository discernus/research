      "description": "The `dimensions` in the framework use a `scoring_guide` string, which deviates from the recommended `scoring_calibration` object structure in the v10.0 specification.",
      "impact": "While functional for LLM prompting, this reduces machine-readability and consistency with v10.0 standards for structured scale calibration. The platform may not be able to leverage automated calibration tools on this format.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, for each dimension, replace the `scoring_guide` string with a `scoring_calibration` object. For example: `scoring_calibration: { high: '0.7-1.0: [Description]', medium: '0.4-0.6: [Description]', low: '0.1-0.3: [Description]', absent: '0.0: [Description]' }`.",

      "description": "The total sample size is N=4 (two groups of n=2). This is too small for the inferential statistical validation of hypotheses like H1 and H2.",
      "impact": "The analysis will be limited to descriptive statistics and qualitative pattern observation, as noted in the experiment's 'Expected Outcomes'. The system will not perform comparative inferential tests (e.g., t-tests) due to insufficient statistical power.",
      "fix": "No fix is required for this test experiment, as the limitations are acknowledged. For future research aiming for generalizable findings, ensure each analytical group has a sufficient sample size (e.g., N>=20 for limited inference, N>=30 for robust inference).",
