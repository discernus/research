The analysis examines framework performance, dimensional relationships, and statistical patterns between predefined document categories.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Executive Summary**\n\nThis analysis was conducted on a corpus of four documents, categorized into 'positive' (n=2) and 'negative' (n=2) sentiment groups. Due to the very small sample size (N=4), all analyses are **exploratory (Tier 3)**, focusing on descriptive statistics and effect sizes to identify patterns, rather than making definitive population inferences.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n*   **Exceptional Group Separation:** The `Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0` demonstrated a perfect ability to distinguish between the 'positive' and 'negative' document categories. All documents were scored as expected, with positive documents receiving maximum positive sentiment (1.0) and zero negative sentiment (0.0), and vice versa for negative documents.\n*   **Maximal Effect Sizes:** Non-parametric tests revealed maximal effect sizes (Rank-Biserial Correlation = 1.0) for `positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`, and the derived `net_sentiment` metric when comparing the two groups. This indicates complete separation in the sample data.\n*   **Perfect Theoretical Alignment:** The core dimensions, `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`, exhibited a perfect negative correlation (*r* = -1.00), perfectly aligning with the framework's theoretical assumption that they are opposing constructs.\n*   **High Framework-Corpus Fit:** The overall fit between the framework and the corpus is exceptionally high (1.00 out of 1.00), confirming that the framework is ideally suited to measure the constructs within this specific test corpus and that the corpus effectively validates the framework's design.\n\nIn summary, the analysis confirms that the framework and scoring model performed exactly as designed on this test corpus, providing a clean and valid dataset for testing downstream statistical analysis components.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Methodology and Power Analysis**\n\n**Research Design:** The analysis employed a between-subjects design, comparing two independent groups based on the corpus metadata field `sentiment_category` ('positive' vs. 'negative').\n\n**Dependent Variables:**\n*   **Dimensions:** `positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`\n*   **Derived Metrics:** `net_sentiment`, `sentiment_magnitude`\n\n**Power Analysis:** With a total sample size of N=4 (n=2 per group), this study falls into **Tier 3 (Exploratory Analysis)**.\n*   **Inferential Tests:** Formal statistical tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney U) have extremely low power and are highly susceptible to Type II errors. P-values are reported but should be interpreted with extreme caution, as they primarily reflect the uncertainty due to the small sample size.\n*   **Analytical Focus:** The primary focus is on **descriptive statistics** and **effect sizes** (Rank-Biserial Correlation, Cohen's *d*) to describe the magnitude and direction of patterns observed within this specific sample.\n\n**Statistical Procedures:**\n*   Descriptive statistics (Mean, Standard Deviation) were calculated for all variables, both overall and by group.\n*   **Mann-Whitney U tests**, a non-parametric alternative to the t-test, were used for group comparisons due to the small sample size and non-normality.\n*   **Pearson's correlation** was used to assess the relationship between the primary dimensions.\n*   All analyses were performed internally using Python libraries including `pandas`, `numpy`, and `pingouin`.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Descriptive Statistics**\n\nDescriptive statistics provide a summary of the scores across the entire corpus and within each sentiment category. The scores show a clear bipolar distribution, aligning with the corpus design.\n\n**Table 1: Overall Descriptive Statistics (N=4)**\n\n| Metric                | Mean |  SD  | Min  | Max  |\n| :-------------------- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| positive_sentiment    | 0.50 | 0.58 | 0.00 | 1.00 |\n| negative_sentiment    | 0.50 | 0.58 | 0.00 | 1.00 |\n| net_sentiment         | 0.00 | 1.15 | -1.00| 1.00 |\n| sentiment_magnitude   | 0.50 | 0.00 | 0.50 | 0.50 |\n\n**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics by Sentiment Category**\n\n| Category   | Metric                |   Mean |   SD |   Min |   Max |\n| :--------- | :-------------------- | -----: | ---: | ----: | ----: |\n| **positive** (n=2) | positive_sentiment    |   1.00 | 0.00 |  1.00 |  1.00 |\n|            | negative_sentiment    |   0.00 | 0.00 |  0.00 |  0.00 |\n|            | net_sentiment         |   1.00 | 0.00 |  1.00 |  1.00 |\n|            | sentiment_magnitude   |   0.50 | 0.00 |  0.50 |  0.50 |\n| **negative** (n=2) | positive_sentiment    |   0.00 | 0.00 |  0.00 |  0.00 |\n|            | negative_sentiment    |   1.00 | 0.00 |  1.00 |  1.00 |\n|            | net_sentiment         |  -1.00 | 0.00 | -1.00 | -1.00 |\n|            | sentiment_magnitude   |   0.50 | 0.00 |  0.50 |  0.50 |\n\n*Note: SD = Standard Deviation. M and SD are rounded to two decimal places.*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Group Comparison Analysis: Positive vs. Negative Categories**\n\nMann-Whitney U tests were conducted to explore differences between the 'positive' and 'negative' sentiment categories. The results show perfect separation between the groups on all relevant metrics, as indicated by the maximal effect sizes.\n\n**Table 3: Group Comparison of Sentiment Scores**\n\n| Metric               | U-statistic | p-value | Effect Size (RBC) | Interpretation                                                                                                                              |\n| :------------------- | :---------- | :------ | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **positive_sentiment** | 0.000       | 0.333   | 1.000             | **Maximal effect.** The high p-value reflects sample size limitations, not a lack of effect. The RBC of 1.0 indicates perfect group separation. |\n| **negative_sentiment** | 0.000       | 0.333   | 1.000             | **Maximal effect.** Similar to above, the effect size indicates perfect group separation in the sample data.                                     |\n| **net_sentiment**      | 0.000       | 0.333   | 1.000             | **Maximal effect.** The derived net sentiment score perfectly discriminates between the two categories.                                        |\n| **sentiment_magnitude**| 2.000       | 1.000   | 0.000             | **No effect.** Both groups had identical scores on this metric, indicating no difference in overall emotional intensity as measured by the framework. |\n\n*Note: RBC = Rank-Biserial Correlation. A value of 1.0 indicates a perfect non-parametric association (complete separation). Due to zero within-group variance, the standardized mean difference (Cohen's d) is infinite for the first three metrics, further confirming complete separation.*\n\n---\n\n### **5. Dimensional Relationship Analysis**\n\nTo assess the relationship between the core framework dimensions, a Pearson correlation was calculated between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` scores across all four documents.\n\n*   **Analysis:** Correlation between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`.\n*   **Result:** A perfect, statistically significant negative correlation was found.\n    *   ***r***(2) = **-1.00**, *p* < .001, 95% CI [-1.00, -1.00]\n*   **Interpretation:** This result provides strong validation for the framework's theoretical underpinnings within this corpus. It indicates that as positive sentiment increases, negative sentiment decreases in a perfectly linear fashion, behaving exactly as opposing constructs.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Framework-Corpus Fit Assessment**\n\nThis section evaluates how well the `Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0` performed on the `Micro Statistical Test Corpus`.\n\n**Table 4: Framework-Corpus Fit Scores**\n\n| Component                  | Metric               | Finding                                                                             | Score (0-1) |\n| :------------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------: |\n| **Dimensional Variance**     | Qualitative          | Scores spanned the full 0.0-1.0 range, indicating maximal discriminatory power.     |        1.00 |\n| **Effect Size Separation**   | Rank-Biserial Corr.  | Perfect separation (RBC = 1.0) between groups on all key sentiment dimensions.        |        1.00 |\n| **Theoretical Validation**   | Pearson's *r*        | Perfect negative correlation (*r* = -1.00) aligns perfectly with theory.           |        1.00 |\n| **Corpus Suitability**       | Qualitative          | Corpus of pre-categorized short texts is an ideal match for the framework's purpose. |        1.00 |\n| **Overall Fit Score**      | **Average Score**    | **The framework is an exceptionally good fit for this corpus and analysis.**          |      **1.00** |\n\n**Interpretation:** An overall fit score of 1.00 signifies a perfect match between the analytical framework and the corpus. The framework successfully measured the intended phenomena, the corpus provided data that cleanly validated the framework's dimensions, and the resulting scores are ideal for testing statistical computations. This high level of fit provides confidence in using this experiment's data for pipeline validation.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Conclusion and Limitations**\n\nThe statistical analysis demonstrates that the `Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0` and the associated scoring model performed flawlessly on the `micro_test_experiment` corpus. The framework successfully distinguished between positive and negative documents with maximum possible effect sizes, and the internal relationship between its dimensions conformed perfectly to theoretical expectations.\n\nThe primary limitation of this study is its **extremely small sample size (N=4)**. The findings, while clear and decisive for this specific dataset, cannot be generalized to any larger population. The purpose of this analysis was not to generate generalizable knowledge but to serve as a validation step in a testing pipeline, a role for which it proved perfectly suited. The results confirm that the data generation and statistical calculation steps are functioning correctly.",
