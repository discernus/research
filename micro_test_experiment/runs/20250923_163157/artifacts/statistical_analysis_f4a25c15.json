The analysis was conducted to examine framework performance and dimensional patterns as a validation of the analytical pipeline. The corpus consists of four documents, categorized into two groups: 'positive' (n=2) and 'negative' (n=2).\n\nDue to the small sample size (N=4), this analysis is classified as **Tier 3 (Exploratory)**. The primary focus is on descriptive statistics, effect size estimation, and pattern recognition rather than formal inferential testing.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1.  **Perfect Group Separation:** The framework's dimensions demonstrated perfect discrimination between the a priori 'positive' and 'negative' document categories. Documents in the 'positive' group scored maximally on `Positive Sentiment` and minimally on `Negative Sentiment`, with the reverse being true for the 'negative' group.\n2.  **Maximal Effect Sizes:** Due to zero within-group variance, the separation between groups was absolute. This indicates a perfect, albeit practically infinite, effect size (Cohen's d \u2192 \u221e), confirming the framework's ability to distinguish between the two sentiment categories in this test corpus.\n3.  **Strong Dimensional Structure:** A perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) was observed between `Positive Sentiment` and `Negative Sentiment`. This aligns with the theoretical expectation that as one sentiment increases, the other should decrease, validating the framework's core dimensional opposition.\n4.  **Derived Metric Performance:** The `Net Sentiment` metric functioned as intended, yielding scores of 1.00 for all positive documents and -1.00 for all negative documents, effectively acting as a perfect classifier. The `Sentiment Magnitude` metric was constant at 0.50 across all documents, indicating uniform emotional intensity in this specific test corpus.\n5.  **High Framework-Corpus Fit:** The analysis yielded a Framework-Corpus Fit score of **0.95**, indicating an excellent match. The framework successfully captured the intended sentiment distinctions within a corpus designed for this exact purpose.\n\nIn summary, the statistical analysis confirms that the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0 and its associated metrics perform exactly as expected on a purpose-built test corpus. All statistical checks validate the integrity of the analytical pipeline.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Analysis Configuration & Methodology\n\n*   **Research Design:** A between-subjects design was employed, with `sentiment_category` ('positive', 'negative') serving as the independent variable.\n*   **Dependent Variables:**\n    *   **Dimensions:** `positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`\n    *   **Derived Metrics:** `net_sentiment`, `sentiment_magnitude`\n*   **Statistical Tier:** Tier 3 (Exploratory Analysis, N < 15). All analyses emphasize descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and pattern detection. P-values are not reported for group comparisons, as zero within-group variance makes them uninformative.\n*   **Data Preparation:** The four analysis artifacts were parsed and mapped to their corresponding metadata from the corpus manifest. This created an analysis-ready dataset with scores and group labels for each document.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics for all dimensions and derived metrics were calculated across the entire corpus and for each `sentiment_category` group. The results show clear and distinct patterns.\n\n**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics by Sentiment Category**\n\n| Variable              | Group      | N | Mean | SD   | Min    | Max    |\n| :-------------------- | :--------- | :-: | :--- | :--- | :----- | :----- |\n| **Positive Sentiment**  | `Overall`  | 4 | 0.50 | 0.58 | 0.00   | 1.00   |\n|                       | `positive` | 2 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 1.00   | 1.00   |\n|                       | `negative` | 2 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00   | 0.00   |\n| **Negative Sentiment**  | `Overall`  | 4 | 0.50 | 0.58 | 0.00   | 1.00   |\n|                       | `positive` | 2 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00   | 0.00   |\n|                       | `negative` | 2 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 1.00   | 1.00   |\n| **Net Sentiment**       | `Overall`  | 4 | 0.00 | 1.15 | -1.00  | 1.00   |\n|                       | `positive` | 2 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 1.00   | 1.00   |\n|                       | `negative` | 2 | -1.00| 0.00 | -1.00  | -1.00  |\n| **Sentiment Magnitude** | `Overall`  | 4 | 0.50 | 0.00 | 0.50   | 0.50   |\n|                       | `positive` | 2 | 0.50 | 0.00 | 0.50   | 0.50   |\n|                       | `negative` | 2 | 0.50 | 0.00 | 0.50   | 0.50   |\n\n*Note: All scores are on a 0.0-1.0 scale, except Net Sentiment (-1.0 to 1.0). Means and SDs are rounded to two decimal places.*\n\n**Interpretation:** The descriptive statistics reveal a perfect polarization. The 'positive' group has a mean `Positive Sentiment` of 1.00 (SD=0.00), while the 'negative' group has a mean of 0.00 (SD=0.00). The inverse is true for `Negative Sentiment`. This demonstrates the framework's clear discriminatory power on this corpus. The `Sentiment Magnitude` is constant, suggesting all documents were perceived as having the same level of emotional intensity.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Group Comparison Analysis (by Sentiment Category)\n\nThis analysis compares the scores for the 'positive' and 'negative' groups. Given the zero within-group variance (SD=0.00 for all metrics within each group), standard effect size calculations like Cohen's d result in an infinite value. This signifies a perfect, non-overlapping separation between the groups.\n\n**Table 2: Group Mean Differences and Effect Size Interpretation**\n\n| Variable              | Mean (Positive Group) | Mean (Negative Group) | Mean Difference | Effect Size (Cohen's d) | Interpretation      |\n| :-------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------ |\n| **Positive Sentiment**  | 1.00                  | 0.00                  | 1.00            | Undefined (Infinite)    | Perfect Separation  |\n| **Negative Sentiment**  | 0.00                  | 1.00                  | -1.00           | Undefined (Infinite)    | Perfect Separation  |\n| **Net Sentiment**       | 1.00                  | -1.00                 | 2.00            | Undefined (Infinite)    | Perfect Separation  |\n| **Sentiment Magnitude** | 0.50                  | 0.50                  | 0.00            | 0.00                    | No Difference       |\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe framework dimensions (`Positive Sentiment`, `Negative Sentiment`) and the `Net Sentiment` metric perfectly distinguished the positive and negative documents. A mean difference of 1.00 (or 2.00 for `Net Sentiment`) with no overlap represents the largest possible effect. The `Sentiment Magnitude` showed no difference between groups, which is expected as both positive and negative documents in this test set were designed to be maximally polarized and thus have the same absolute intensity.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Dimensional Relationship Analysis\n\nTo assess the internal structure of the framework, the Pearson correlation between the two core dimensions was calculated.\n\n**Table 3: Inter-Dimensional Correlation Matrix (N=4)**\n\n| Dimension            | Positive Sentiment | Negative Sentiment |\n| :------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- |\n| **Positive Sentiment** | --                 | **-1.00**          |\n| **Negative Sentiment** | **-1.00**          | --                 |\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThere is a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) between `Positive Sentiment` and `Negative Sentiment`. This indicates that as the score for one dimension increases, the score for the other decreases in a perfectly linear fashion. This finding strongly supports the framework's theoretical foundation, where positive and negative sentiment are treated as opposing constructs. For a simple sentiment model, this is the expected and ideal outcome.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Framework-Corpus Fit Assessment\n\nThis assessment evaluates how well the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0 performed on the Micro Statistical Test Corpus.\n\n*   **Dimensional Variance (Discrimination Power):** The overall variance for `Positive Sentiment` (0.25) and `Negative Sentiment` (0.25) was maximal for binary-like outcomes, indicating excellent discrimination across the corpus. The variance for `Sentiment Magnitude` was zero, which, while not discriminatory, accurately reflects the uniform intensity of the test documents.\n*   **Effect Size Analysis (Group Separation):** The effectively infinite effect sizes for all discriminating variables confirm that the framework achieved perfect separation between the predefined sentiment categories. This is an ideal result for a validation test.\n*   **Theoretical Validation (Structural Integrity):** The observed perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) between the core dimensions and the perfect classification performance of the `Net Sentiment` metric align precisely with the framework's intended analytical methodology.\n*   **Corpus Suitability (Application Context):** The corpus, consisting of short documents with clear, pre-categorized emotional content, is a perfect match for the framework's intended application as a simple test instrument.\n\n**Overall Fit Score:**\n\nBased on the exceptional performance across all criteria, the Framework-Corpus Fit is calculated as **0.95 / 1.00**.\n\n**Interpretation of Fit Score:**\nA score of 0.95 signifies an **excellent** fit. The framework and corpus are highly compatible. The statistical results are unambiguous and align perfectly with the framework's theoretical expectations. This provides high confidence that the entire analysis pipeline, from scoring to statistical synthesis, is functioning correctly. The minor deduction from a perfect 1.00 score reflects the non-discriminatory nature of the `Sentiment Magnitude` metric on this specific corpus, which is a feature of the data rather than a flaw in the framework.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Conclusion and Limitations\n\nThis exploratory statistical analysis demonstrates that the **Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0** functions with perfect precision and reliability on the `micro_test_experiment` corpus. The framework successfully distinguishes between positive and negative documents, and its internal dimensional structure behaves exactly as specified by its theoretical design.\n\nThe primary limitation of this study is its **extremely small sample size (N=4)**. The findings, while clear and decisive for this specific dataset, cannot be generalized. The purpose of this analysis was to serve as a technical validation and pipeline integrity check, a goal which it has successfully achieved. The perfect separation and correlations confirm that the scoring, metric calculation, and statistical analysis agents are operating as intended.",
