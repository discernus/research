      "description": "The corpus manifest `corpus.md` specifies `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, while the `experiment.md` and `framework.md` both use the current `spec_version: \"10.0\"`. While the v8.0 corpus structure appears compatible with the v10.0 experiment requirements (specifically, the presence of metadata for statistical grouping), this version mismatch could lead to unexpected behavior if future v10 features rely on corpus spec changes not present in v8.",
      "impact": "The experiment is expected to run correctly because the necessary grouping metadata ('sentiment_category') is present. However, this version inconsistency violates the principle of a fully coherent specification stack and might fail on stricter validation in future platform versions.",
      "fix": "Update the `spec_version` in `corpus.md` to `\"10.0\"` and ensure its structure is fully compliant with the latest corpus specification, even if no structural changes are immediately required.",

  "suggestions": [
    "To improve analysis reliability and align with v10.0 best practices, consider enhancing the `dimensions` in `framework.md`. Replace the `scoring_guide` string with the more structured `scoring_calibration` object and add a `markers` section with positive, negative, and boundary case examples. This provides the analysis agent with clearer guidance, reducing ambiguity and improving scoring consistency."
