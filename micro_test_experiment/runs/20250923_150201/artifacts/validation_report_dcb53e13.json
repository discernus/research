This is logically inconsistent, as H3 ('There are observable patterns...') is a general statement that does not exclude H1 or H2, and the set {H1, H2, H3} is not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive.",
      "impact": "This indicates a flaw in the conceptual research design which could be questioned during peer review. It does not affect machine execution.",

      "impact": "The lack of concrete examples and a detailed calibration scale increases the risk of the analysis agent misinterpreting dimensions or applying the 0.0-1.0 scale inconsistently, which reduces the validity of the scores.",

    "For the 'sentiment_magnitude' derived metric, consider using a salience-weighted average, such as `(dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score * dimensions.positive_sentiment.salience + dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score * dimensions.negative_sentiment.salience) / (dimensions.positive_sentiment.salience + dimensions.negative_sentiment.salience + 0.001)`. This provides a more robust calculation that accounts for the rhetorical emphasis of each sentiment."
