Detailed Interpretation of Results**\n\n#### **Descriptive Statistics**\n\nThe descriptive statistics reveal a perfectly polarized dataset.\n*   The `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` dimensions both have a mean of 0.5 and identical standard deviations. This indicates that the dataset is perfectly balanced between positive and negative examples.\n*   The derived `net_sentiment` metric has a mean of 0.0, confirming the overall balance. However, its standard deviation is high (1.15), showing that individual documents are not neutral but are at the extremes of the scale (either +1.0 or -1.0).\n*   The `sentiment_magnitude` is constant at 0.5 for all documents. This is a key insight: it means every document in this sample has the same level of \"emotional intensity,\" even though the polarity is different.\n\n#### **Correlation Analysis**\n\nThe analysis found a **perfect negative correlation (r = -1.0)** between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`.\n*   **Interpretation:** This means that as the score for positive sentiment increases, the score for negative sentiment decreases in a perfectly linear fashion. In this specific dataset, a document is either positive or negative, but not both.\n*   **Significance:** The p-value is effectively 0, which indicates that this perfect correlation is statistically significant. We can be highly confident that this inverse relationship is not due to random chance *within this specific dataset*.\n\n#### **Statistical Significance Testing (Group Comparison)**\n\nTo test the framework's ability to distinguish between document types, we artificially created two groups based on the scores and compared their `net_sentiment`.\n*   **Method:** A Mann-Whitney U test was used because the small sample size (n=2 per group) violates the assumptions of parametric tests like the t-test.\n*   **Result:** The test yielded a p-value of **0.3333**.\n*   **Interpretation:** Conventionally, a p-value greater than 0.05 means we cannot conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the groups. However, this is a textbook example of how small sample sizes limit statistical power. With only two samples in each group, the *lowest possible p-value* this test can produce is 0.3333. Therefore, while the groups are perfectly separated in the data, we cannot achieve \"statistical significance\" in the traditional sense. This result correctly demonstrates the limitations of significance testing on minimal data.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThis analysis successfully demonstrates the functionality of a statistical validation pipeline. The provided scores were processed, derived metrics were calculated, and standard statistical tests were performed.\n\nThe key findings are:\n1.  The dataset is composed of perfectly polarized documents.\n2.  `Positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` are perfectly and significantly negatively correlated.\n3.  The \"emotional intensity\" (`sentiment_magnitude`) is identical across all documents.\n\nThe primary takeaway is that while the analytical code runs correctly and produces mathematically sound results, the **statistical conclusions are severely limited by the small sample size (N=4)**. This analysis is best viewed as a successful **technical validation** of the analysis pipeline rather than a scientifically robust study.",
