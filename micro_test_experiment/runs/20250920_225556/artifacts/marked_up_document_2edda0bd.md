[NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: Thousands of retirees, who dedicated their lives to public service, have been callously betrayed] and now face a future of [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: financial ruin] and [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: profound uncertainty]. The responsible officials have offered nothing but [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: hollow excuses] and [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: evasive maneuvers], refusing to accept accountability for this [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: dreadful failure]. The sense of [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: outrage] and [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: despair] among the victims is [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: immense], as their trust in our institutions has been [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: completely shattered].\n\nThis is a [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: crisis] born of [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: systemic corruption] and [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: institutional decay]. The [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: warning signs were ignored] for years, and auditors' reports detailing the [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: escalating risks were deliberately buried].

The [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: failure is so absolute] it [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: defies simple explanation].",
