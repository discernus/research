      "description": "Framework dimensions use a free-text `scoring_guide` instead of the structured `scoring_calibration` object recommended in the v10.0 specification. The v10.0 spec recommends a structured object with `high`, `medium`, `low`, and `absent` keys to improve scoring consistency.",
      "impact": "The analysis will execute, but using a free-text guide may lead to less consistent scoring by the language model compared to the more structured `scoring_calibration` format. The prompt does provide guidance, which mitigates this, but adhering to the spec is best practice.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, replace the `scoring_guide` string for each dimension with a structured `scoring_calibration` object. Example: `scoring_calibration: { high: '0.7-1.0: ...', medium: '0.4-0.6: ...', low: '0.1-0.3: ...', absent: '0.0: ...' }`.",

      "description": "Framework dimensions are missing the `markers` section, which is a recommended best practice in the v10.0 specification for providing positive examples, negative examples, and boundary cases to the language model.",
      "impact": "The analysis will run, but the absence of explicit markers increases the risk of the language model misinterpreting dimensions or conflating similar concepts, potentially reducing analytical accuracy.",
      "fix": "For each dimension in `framework.md`, add a `markers` section with `positive_examples`, `negative_examples`, and `boundary_cases` to provide clear, concrete examples and non-examples.",

      "description": "The hypotheses in the experiment specification are all marked as `mutually_exclusive: true`. However, H3 ('There are observable patterns...') is a general statement that is not logically mutually exclusive with H1 or H2; patterns found could confirm H1 and H2.",
      "impact": "This is a logical inconsistency in the human-readable part of the research design and does not affect machine execution. However, it may weaken the formal structure of the hypotheses.",
      "fix": "In `experiment.md`, review the `mutually_exclusive` and `collective_exhaustive` properties for the hypotheses to ensure they accurately reflect their logical relationships. For H3, consider setting `mutually_exclusive: false`.",

    "The experiment correctly identifies that the small sample size (N=4) is suitable for descriptive analysis and pattern identification. This aligns with platform guidelines (v10.0 spec, section 5.4), which state that a sample of this size is appropriate for case study analysis and qualitative patterns, not inferential statistics. The setup is coherent and well-justified for its stated purpose."
