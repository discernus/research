      "description": "The framework dimensions use a simplified `scoring_guide` and lack the recommended `markers` section containing positive, negative, and boundary examples. The v10.0 specification details a more structured `scoring_calibration` object and a `markers` section to improve agent accuracy and prevent concept drift.",
      "impact": "Without explicit examples and structured calibration, the analysis agent's interpretation of the dimensions may be less consistent and reliable across documents, potentially reducing the quality of the output scores.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, replace the `scoring_guide` string for each dimension with a `scoring_calibration` object and add a `markers` section with `positive_examples`, `negative_examples`, and `boundary_cases` as recommended in the v10.0 framework specification.",

      "description": "The corpus manifest `corpus.md` specifies `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, while the current standard is `v8.0.2`.",
      "impact": "This is a minor non-compliance and has no functional impact on this experiment, but using the latest specification version is best practice for ensuring future compatibility and access to the latest platform features.",
      "fix": "In the YAML appendix of `corpus.md`, update the `spec_version` field to `\"8.0.2\"`.",

  "suggestions": [
    "Consider enhancing the 'sentiment_magnitude' derived metric by incorporating salience scores. A salience-weighted average, such as `(dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score * dimensions.positive_sentiment.salience + dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score * dimensions.negative_sentiment.salience) / (dimensions.positive_sentiment.salience + dimensions.negative_sentiment.salience + 0.001)`, can provide a more robust measure of emotional intensity by accounting for the prominence of each sentiment. This aligns with the best practices outlined in the v10.0 framework specification for defensive and context-aware calculations."
