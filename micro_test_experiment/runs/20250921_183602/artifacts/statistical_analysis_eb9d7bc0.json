As a statistical analysis expert, I will generate and execute Python code to perform a comprehensive analysis of the provided dimensional scores, based on the \"Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0\".\n\n### Executive Summary of Statistical Findings\n\nThe analysis of the four document scores reveals a dataset with extreme and opposing sentiment values. Key findings include:\n\n1.  **Polarized Scores:** The `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` scores are perfectly polarized; documents are rated as either 1.0 on positive and 0.0 on negative, or vice-versa. There is no nuance or mixed sentiment in this sample.\n2.  **Perfect Negative Correlation:** There is a statistically significant, perfect negative correlation (r = -1.0, p < 0.001) between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`. This confirms that as one score increases, the other decreases in a perfectly linear fashion, which is expected given the polarized data.\n3.  **Constant Emotional Intensity:** The derived metric `sentiment_magnitude`, which measures overall emotional intensity, is constant across all documents (0.5). This indicates that while the *direction* of sentiment changes, the *intensity* is uniform in this dataset.\n4.  **Net Sentiment as a Proxy:** The `net_sentiment` score functions as a perfect proxy for `positive_sentiment` (r = 1.0) and a perfect inverse proxy for `negative_sentiment` (r = -1.0), clearly distinguishing between the two categories of documents.\n\n**Limitation Note:** The sample size (n=4) is extremely small. While the observed relationships are perfect within this sample, these findings cannot be generalized to a larger population without a more extensive dataset. The analysis is valid for validating pipeline functionality on a controlled, simple input, as intended by the framework.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code for Statistical Analysis\n\nHere is the complete Python code used for the analysis.

Correlation Matrix Visualization ###\n\nA heatmap visualization has been generated to show the relationships between variables.\n```\n\n### Correlation Matrix Visualization\n\n\n\n### Interpretation of Results\n\n1.  **Descriptive Statistics:**\n    *   The `mean` for both `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` is 0.5, with a standard deviation of ~0.58. This indicates that the scores are perfectly balanced between the two extremes (0.0 and 1.0) within this dataset.\n    *   The `net_sentiment` has a mean of 0.0, confirming the perfect balance between positive and negative documents in the sample. Its standard deviation is high (~1.15), reflecting the polarized outcomes of -1.0 or 1.0.\n    *   Crucially, `sentiment_magnitude` has a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.0. This means it is a constant value across all documents, indicating that every document has the same level of total emotional intensity.\n\n2.  **Correlation Analysis:**\n    *   **Positive vs. Negative Sentiment (r = -1.0):** There is a perfect negative correlation. This means that when one score is high (1.0), the other is low (0.0), without exception. This pattern is characteristic of a dataset containing only purely positive or purely negative examples.\n    *   **Net Sentiment:** This derived metric correlates perfectly positively (r = 1.0) with `positive_sentiment` and perfectly negatively (r = -1.0) with `negative_sentiment`. It effectively serves as a single score to distinguish the two document types.\n    *   **Sentiment Magnitude:** The correlation with `sentiment_magnitude` is shown as `NaN` (Not a Number). This occurs because its standard deviation is zero (it's a constant value). A variable that does not change cannot co-vary with any other variable, so correlation cannot be calculated. This is a correct and expected statistical result given the data.\n\n3.  **Statistical Significance Testing:**\n    *   The Pearson test between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` yielded a correlation coefficient `r` of **-1.0** and a `p-value` of **0.0000**.\n    *   A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the observed correlation is statistically significant. We can confidently state that the perfect negative relationship between positive and negative sentiment is not due to random chance *within this specific dataset*. As noted previously, the small sample size prevents generalization. This result successfully validates that the statistical analysis part of a pipeline can detect and confirm strong relationships in the data.",
