It represents the output from a hypothetical upstream sentiment analysis agent.\n3.  **`framework_spec`**: This dictionary effectively embeds the relevant parts of the YAML specification that are needed for calculating the derived metrics. It includes the names, formulas, and interpretations for each derived metric.\n4.  **`calculate_derived_metrics(dimensional_scores, spec)` function**:\n    *   **`context` preparation**: A crucial step where the `dimensional_scores` are structured in a way that directly mirrors the `formula` syntax defined in the `spec` (e.g., `dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score`). This makes the `eval()` function's job straightforward.\n    *   **`calculated_metrics` dictionary**: An empty dictionary to store the results of the calculations.\n    *   **Iterating through `spec[\"derived_metrics\"]`**: The code loops through each derived metric defined in the specification.\n    *   **`eval(formula, {}, context)`**: This is where the actual calculation happens. Python's `eval()` function dynamically evaluates the string `formula`. The second argument `{}` is for global scope (not needed here), and the third argument `context` provides the local scope, allowing `eval()` to access `dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score` and `dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score`.\n        *   **Security Note**: While `eval()` is powerful, it can be a security risk if the `formula` strings come from untrusted sources (e.g., user input). In this controlled environment, where the framework specification is static and defined within the code or a trusted configuration, it is acceptable for demonstrating the calculation logic. For production systems with dynamic formulas, safer alternatives like `ast.literal_eval` (for simpler expressions) or dedicated expression evaluation libraries would be preferred.\n    *   **Error Handling**: A `try-except` block is included to catch potential errors during formula evaluation (e.g., syntax errors in the formula, missing dimensions).\n5.  **Execution and Display**:\n    *   The code first prints the input scores for clarity.\n    *   It then calls `calculate_derived_metrics` to perform the calculations.\n    *   Finally, it prints the `derived_metrics_results` in a human-readable JSON format.\n    *   An \"Interpretation\" section is added, which uses the calculated values and the `interpretation` strings from the `framework_spec` to provide context on what the derived metric values mean.\n\n### Auditability:\n\n*   **Clear Input/Output**: The input `scores_input` and output `derived_metrics_results` are explicitly defined and printed.\n*   **Direct Formula Mapping**: The `framework_spec` clearly links each derived metric's name to its precise mathematical `formula`. The Python code directly translates these formulas using `eval()`, allowing easy verification against the specification.\n*   **Step-by-Step Logic**: The function `calculate_derived_metrics` logically processes the specification and applies the formulas, with comments explaining each step.\n*   **Reproducibility**: Given the same `scores_input` and `framework_spec`, the code will consistently produce the same results.",
