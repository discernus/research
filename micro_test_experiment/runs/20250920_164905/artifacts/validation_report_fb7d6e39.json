      "description": "The boolean flags for `mutually_exclusive` and `collective_exhaustive` on hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 appear to be incorrectly applied. For instance, H1 (positive documents show higher positive sentiment) and H2 (negative documents show higher negative sentiment) are not mutually exclusive, as both can be true simultaneously. Similarly, they are not collectively exhaustive as it is possible for neither to be true.",
      "impact": "This does not block execution but represents a logical inconsistency in the formal research design. The properties of the hypotheses as stated are not correctly described, which can affect the interpretation of the hypothesis testing framework.",
      "fix": "Review the logical definitions of 'mutually exclusive' and 'collectively exhaustive' and set the boolean flags to `false` for these hypotheses, as is typical for this type of comparative analysis.",
