Thousands of retirees, who dedicated their lives to public service, have been callously betrayed and now face a future of financial ruin and profound uncertainty.\",\n  \"This is a crisis born of systemic corruption and institutional decay. The warning signs were ignored for years, and auditors' reports detailing the escalating risks were deliberately buried. The financial devastation is horrific, but the deeper damage is to the social contract. This was not a market fluctuation; it was a deliberate, slow-motion disaster orchestrated by incompetent and self-serving bureaucrats.\",\n  \"The betrayal of public trust is complete and unforgivable. The impact on retirees and their families is devastating and irreversible. Many elderly citizens who planned their entire lives around the security of their pension benefits now face the prospect of poverty and homelessness.\"\n]",
