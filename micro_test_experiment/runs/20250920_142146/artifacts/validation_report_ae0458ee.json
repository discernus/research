      "description": "The machine-readable appendix in `framework.md` claims `spec_version: \"10.0\"` but does not adhere to the v10.0 specification structure. Specific violations include: 1) The `dimensions` section uses an outdated format (`definition`, `min_score`, `max_score`, `scoring_guide`) instead of the required v10.0 format with `description`, `markers`, and `scoring_calibration`. 2) The `derived_metrics` section uses the key `calculation` instead of `formula` and uses an ambiguous variable syntax. 3) The `output_schema` is structurally non-compliant, defining top-level `evidence` and `marked_up_document` fields instead of the required structure where `evidence` is nested within each dimension's score object.",
      "impact": "The analysis agent will fail to parse the framework configuration, leading to execution failure or highly unreliable results, as it expects the v10.0 structure for prompt generation and output validation.",
      "fix": "Restructure the entire machine-readable appendix in `framework.md` to conform to the v10.0 Framework Specification. Update the `dimensions` section to use `description`, `markers`, and `scoring_calibration`. Update `derived_metrics` to use the `formula` key and explicit syntax (e.g., `dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score - dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score`). Update the `output_schema` to match the v10.0 structure as documented in the specification.",

      "description": "Hypotheses H1 and H2 are incorrectly labeled as `mutually_exclusive: true`. It is possible for both to be true simultaneously (e.g., positive documents have higher positive scores than negative documents, AND negative documents have higher negative scores than positive documents).",
      "impact": "This indicates a minor logical flaw in the research design documentation. It does not prevent execution but may affect the interpretation of the results if the logical properties are taken at face value.",
      "fix": "Review the logical relationship between H1 and H2. Set `mutually_exclusive` to `false` for both hypotheses in `experiment.md`.",
