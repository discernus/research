While parsers may ignore this, it deviates from the standard. All scholarly content like hypotheses should be in the human-readable prose section.",
      "impact": "This is a minor specification violation. While it may not cause an immediate failure, it makes the experiment file non-compliant with the v10.0 standard, potentially causing issues with future tooling or validation agents.",

Although an 'analysis_prompt' and 'scoring_guide' are present, the structured format provides more reliable guidance to the analysis agent.",
      "impact": "The absence of structured examples and calibration can lead to less consistent and less reliable scoring by the LLM agent across different documents, potentially reducing the quality of the analytical output.",
      "fix": "For each dimension in 'framework.md', add the 'markers' (with positive_examples, negative_examples) and 'scoring_calibration' (with high, medium, low, absent) objects to the YAML definition, as detailed in the v10.0 framework specification.",

      "impact": "This is a minor compliance issue and does not block execution. However, using outdated spec versions may lead to missing out on new features or validation checks in the future.",
