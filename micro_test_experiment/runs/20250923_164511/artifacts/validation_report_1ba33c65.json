      "impact": "This is unlikely to cause execution failures as the structure is compatible, but it indicates the manifest may not be aligned with the latest documentation and validation rules for the v8.x series.",
      "fix": "Update the `spec_version` field in `corpus.md` to `\"8.0.2\"` to align with the current corpus specification standard.",

      "description": "The framework's `analysis_prompt` and `dimensions` definitions are functional but could be enhanced for greater analytical robustness and LLM reliability. The v10.0 framework specification recommends including detailed `scoring_calibration` guides, as well as `markers` with positive, negative, and boundary case examples for each dimension.",
      "impact": "Adding this detail reduces the risk of LLM scale drift, concept conflation, and improves the consistency and reliability of scoring across documents.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, expand the `dimensions` objects to include `scoring_calibration` blocks and `markers` with concrete examples, as outlined in the v10.0 Framework Specification best practices.",
