The system will be unable to locate the specified framework component.",
      "impact": "The experiment will fail to execute because the orchestrator cannot find the required framework file at the specified path.",

      "description": "The experiment specifies formal hypotheses (H1, H2) that imply comparative inferential testing. However, with a total sample size of N=4 (n=2 per group), such tests are statistically invalid according to platform guidelines (N=4-9 is for 'Case study analysis' only).",
      "impact": "The experiment will run and produce descriptive statistics, but the formal hypotheses cannot be validly tested or falsified. This creates a mismatch between the stated research goals and the methodologically sound outputs.",
      "fix": "Reframe hypotheses H1 and H2 as descriptive research questions or expected patterns, consistent with the 'Expected Outcomes' and 'Data Grouping' sections which correctly identify the analysis as descriptive. For example: 'Examine whether positive sentiment documents show higher average positive sentiment scores...'.",

      "description": "The markers for the 'negative_sentiment' dimension in the framework are inverted. The 'positive_examples' field contains negative words (e.g., 'bad', 'terrible'), and the 'negative_examples' field contains positive words (e.g., 'good', 'excellent').",
      "impact": "This will confuse the analysis agent, likely leading to inaccurate and unreliable scoring for the `negative_sentiment` dimension, undermining the validity of all subsequent calculations and analyses.",
      "fix": "In 'framework.md', within the 'negative_sentiment' dimension, swap the lists of words between `positive_examples` and `negative_examples`. The `positive_examples` should contain words indicative of negative sentiment.",

      "description": "The derived metric `sentiment_magnitude` is calculated as an average `(positive + negative) / 2`. The term 'magnitude' can sometimes imply a sum, and the framework's narrative describes it as 'Combined intensity'. The YAML description clarifies it's an average, but there is a minor inconsistency.",
      "impact": "This is a minor semantic ambiguity that does not block execution but could be clarified for improved readability and future use.",
      "fix": "For maximum clarity, consider renaming the metric to `average_sentiment_intensity`. Alternatively, change the formula to a simple sum `dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score + dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score` to align with the term 'magnitude' and the 'Combined intensity' description.",
