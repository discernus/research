      "description": "The corpus manifest `corpus.md` specifies `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, while `experiment.md` and `framework.md` use `spec_version: \"10.0\"`. While the platform supports backward compatibility, using a consistent specification version across all experiment components is recommended to ensure clarity and full feature alignment.",
      "impact": "The experiment will execute, but there is a minor risk of mismatched expectations regarding corpus specification features. The system will interpret the corpus based on the older v8.0 standard, not the current v10.0 standard assumed by other components.",
      "fix": "Update the `spec_version` field in `corpus.md` to `\"10.0\"` and verify that the manifest conforms to the latest specification.",

      "description": "The experiment's corpus has a total sample size of N=4 (two groups of n=2). This size is insufficient for inferential statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA), which require larger samples to achieve statistical power.",
      "impact": "Analysis will be limited to descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations) and qualitative pattern observation. The hypotheses listed in `experiment.md` cannot be statistically tested for significance; they can only be evaluated descriptively.",
      "fix": "Acknowledge that the analysis is purely descriptive, as stated in the 'Expected Outcomes'. For future experiments requiring hypothesis testing, expand the corpus to meet minimum sample size guidelines (e.g., N>10 per group for basic inferential tests).",

  "suggestions": [
    "In `framework.md`, consider replacing the `scoring_guide` string within each dimension with the more structured `scoring_calibration` object, which provides more granular guidance (e.g., '0.9-1.0: Dominant positive language') to the analysis agent, potentially improving scoring consistency and reliability."
