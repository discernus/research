      "description": "Framework dimensions use a free-text `scoring_guide` instead of the more precise `scoring_calibration` structure recommended in the v10.0 Framework Specification. The current implementation provides a single-line guide, whereas the v10.0 spec encourages a structured block with high/medium/low/absent definitions for better LLM consistency.",
      "impact": "Using a free-text `scoring_guide` may lead to less consistent and reliable scoring across documents compared to a structured `scoring_calibration` block, which provides clearer anchors for the 0.0-1.0 scale.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, for each dimension, replace the `scoring_guide` field with a `scoring_calibration` object. Example: `scoring_calibration: { high: \"0.7-1.0: [description]\", medium: \"0.4-0.6: [description]\", low: \"0.1-0.3: [description]\", absent: \"0.0: [description]\" }`.",

      "description": "The corpus manifest `corpus.md` specifies `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, while the current referenced standard is v8.0.2. The experiment's functionality is not affected as it relies on features present in v8.0.",
      "impact": "This is a minor version mismatch that does not block execution but indicates the corpus file is not declared against the latest specification version. It may lack awareness of newer spec features or clarifications, such as those for custom analytical groupings.",
      "fix": "Update the `spec_version` field in `corpus.md` to `\"8.0.2\"` to align with the current corpus specification standard.",

      "description": "The experiment is designed for descriptive analysis and pattern identification with a small sample size (N=4), which is explicitly noted in the experiment specification. This aligns with the platform's guidance for small-N studies.",
      "impact": "No negative impact. This is a positive validation note. The experiment appropriately scopes its analytical goals to the available data, avoiding claims of statistical power that cannot be supported. Inferential statistics (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) would be invalid, but the experiment correctly focuses on descriptive patterns.",
      "fix": "No fix is required. The experiment design is coherent with its corpus size and adheres to best practices for small-sample analysis.",
