Thousands of retirees, who dedicated their lives to public service, have been callously betrayed and now face a future of financial ruin and profound uncertainty. The responsible officials have offered nothing but hollow excuses and evasive maneuvers, refusing to accept accountability for this dreadful failure. The sense of outrage and despair among the victims is immense, as their trust in our institutions has been completely shattered.\n\nThis is a crisis born of systemic corruption and institutional decay. The warning signs were ignored for years, and auditors' reports detailing the escalating risks were deliberately buried. The financial devastation is horrific, but the deeper damage is to the social contract. This was not a market fluctuation; it was a deliberate, slow-motion disaster orchestrated by incompetent and self-serving bureaucrats. The aftermath is a tragic landscape of broken promises and ruined lives, a terrible stain on our state's history that will not soon be forgotten. The failure is so absolute it defies simple explanation.\n",
