      "description": "The 'mutually_exclusive' and 'collective_exhaustive' properties for the hypotheses in the experiment's machine-readable appendix are logically questionable. Hypotheses H1 ('Positive sentiment documents show higher positive sentiment scores') and H2 ('Negative sentiment documents show higher negative sentiment scores') are not mutually exclusive, as it's possible for both to be true. The 'collective_exhaustive' property is also difficult to justify for this set of hypotheses.",
      "impact": "This does not affect machine execution but represents a logical inconsistency in the formal research design. It may cause confusion during peer review or interpretation of the experiment's theoretical setup.",
      "fix": "Review the logical relationships between the hypotheses. Set 'mutually_exclusive' to 'false' for H1 and H2. Re-evaluate if the set of hypotheses is truly 'collective_exhaustive' and update the flag accordingly.",

      "description": "The phrasing of Hypotheses H1 and H2 implies comparative inferential testing (e.g., 'show higher... scores'), while the experiment's scope, as correctly stated in the abstract and data grouping sections, is limited to descriptive analysis and pattern identification due to the small sample size (N=4).",
      "impact": "This is a minor misalignment between the formal hypothesis language and the practical analytical scope. While the rest of the experiment correctly defines its limitations, this discrepancy could create an expectation of statistical significance testing that cannot be performed.",
      "fix": "To improve clarity, consider rephrasing the hypotheses to align with the descriptive nature of the analysis. For example: 'It is expected that positive sentiment documents will have descriptively higher positive sentiment scores than negative sentiment documents.'",
