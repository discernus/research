      "description": "The hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 are all marked as 'mutually_exclusive: true' and 'collective_exhaustive: true', but these properties do not apply. Hypotheses H1 (positive docs have higher positive scores) and H2 (negative docs have higher negative scores) can both be true simultaneously and are therefore not mutually exclusive. Hypothesis H3 (observable patterns exist) is a general outcome that is not mutually exclusive with the more specific H1 and H2. The set of hypotheses is also not collectively exhaustive, as it is possible for none of them to be true.",
      "impact": "The logical properties of the hypotheses are incorrectly stated, which weakens the formal research design. This does not block automated execution but represents a quality issue in the experimental logic and documentation.",
      "fix": "Review the definitions of 'mutually exclusive' and 'collectively exhaustive'. Update the boolean flags for H1, H2, and H3 to 'false' to accurately reflect that they are independent, non-competing research expectations.",
