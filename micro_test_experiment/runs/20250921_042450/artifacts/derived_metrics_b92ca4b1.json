Each dimension includes a `raw_score` as specified by the framework.\n\n2.  **`calculate_derived_metrics` Function:**\n    *   This function takes the `dimensional_scores` dictionary as input.\n    *   It extracts the `raw_score` for both `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`. Defaulting to `0.0` ensures the code doesn't break if a score is missing, though in this specific input, they are present.\n    *   **Net Sentiment Calculation:**\n        *   **Formula:** `positive_score - negative_score`\n        *   **Calculation:** `1.0 - 0.0 = 1.0`\n        *   **Interpretation:** A `Net Sentiment` of `1.0` indicates a strong positive sentiment, as the positive score is significantly higher than the negative score.\n    *   **Sentiment Magnitude Calculation:**\n        *   **Formula:** `(positive_score + negative_score) / 2`\n        *   **Calculation:** `(1.0 + 0.0) / 2 = 0.5`\n        *   **Interpretation:** A `Sentiment Magnitude` of `0.5` suggests moderate emotional intensity. This means that while the sentiment is clearly positive (due to `Net Sentiment`), the overall expression of emotion is neither extremely weak nor extremely strong on average.\n\n3.  **Output:** The code prints the original dimensional scores and the newly calculated derived metrics in a clear, readable JSON format. It then provides an interpretation of these derived metrics based on the framework's guidelines.",
