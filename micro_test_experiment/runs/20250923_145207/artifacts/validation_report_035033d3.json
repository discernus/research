According to the v10.0 specification, 'dimensions', 'derived_metrics', and 'analysis_variants' must be separate, top-level keys.",
      "impact": "The system will fail to parse the analytical dimensions and derived metrics, making it impossible to perform the analysis or calculate results. This is a critical configuration error that will cause the experiment to fail.",
      "fix": "In framework.md, move the 'dimensions' and 'derived_metrics' blocks out of the 'analysis_variants' block so they are at the same indentation level as 'metadata' and 'output_schema'.",

      "impact": "The extraneous data will likely be ignored by the current parser, but it represents a deviation from the specification that could cause validation failures with stricter parsers or future platform versions.",
      "fix": "Remove the entire 'hypotheses' block from the YAML appendix in 'experiment.md' to ensure full compliance with the v10.0 specification. Hypotheses should be described in the human-readable narrative portion of the file.",
