    "raw_curation_response": "Here are the curated quotes exemplifying the perfect bipolar sentiment split and reflecting emotional intensity, in line with the statistical findings.\n\n**Curation Rationale:**\n\nThe selected quotes demonstrate a clear and unambiguous polarity, with Documents 0 and 1 exhibiting overwhelmingly positive sentiment, and Documents 2 and 3 exhibiting overwhelmingly negative sentiment. This directly supports the \"Perfect group separation between 'positive' and 'negative' documents on sentiment scores\" and the \"Perfect negative correlation (r=-1.0) between positive_sentiment and negative_sentiment.\"\n\nCrucially, each selected quote also conveys a high degree of emotional intensity, whether positive or negative. Phrases like \"monumental achievement,\" \"absolute triumph,\" \"calamitous event,\" and \"disastrous humanitarian and ecological crisis\" are not merely directional but also convey significant emotional weight. The consistent presence of such strong emotional language across all documents, regardless of polarity, provides qualitative evidence for why the model might have assigned a uniform `sentiment_magnitude` score of 0.50. This suggests that the model detected a high, consistent level of emotional arousal or significance in the language used, even if the valence differed.\n\n---\n\n### Curated Evidence for Bipolar Sentiment Analysis\n\n**Document 0 (Positive Sentiment, High Intensity)**\n\n*   **Document index:** 0\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"The launch of the new satellite network is a monumental achievement for our nation's scientific community and a beacon of our technological prowess.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Perfect group separation (positive), perfect negative correlation, zero variance in sentiment_magnitude (demonstrates high positive intensity).\n*   **Strength rating:** 5\n\n*   **Document index:** 0\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"The successful deployment is a testament to the brilliant, tireless work of our engineers and scientists, who have delivered a flawless system ahead of schedule and under budget.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Perfect group separation (positive), perfect negative correlation, zero variance in sentiment_magnitude (demonstrates high positive intensity).\n*   **Strength rating:** 4\n\n*   **Document index:** 0\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"The sense of accomplishment and shared purpose is palpable; this is a clear and decisive victory that will drive prosperity and inspire our next generation of innovators for years to come.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Perfect group separation (positive), perfect negative correlation, zero variance in sentiment_magnitude (demonstrates high positive intensity).\n*   **Strength rating:** 5\n\n**Document 1 (Positive Sentiment, High Intensity)**\n\n*   **Document index:** 1\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"The community-led arts festival was an absolute triumph, celebrating our city's rich cultural tapestry with unparalleled vibrancy and joy.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Perfect group separation (positive), perfect negative correlation, zero variance in sentiment_magnitude (demonstrates high positive intensity).\n*   **Strength rating:** 5\n\n*   **Document index:** 1\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"It was a perfect, inspiring event that showcased the very best of our community, leaving everyone with a lasting feeling of warmth and pride.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Perfect group separation (positive), perfect negative correlation, zero variance in sentiment_magnitude (demonstrates high positive intensity).\n*   **Strength rating:** 5\n\n*   **Document index:** 1\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"The community's response has been so overwhelmingly positive that the festival is now considered a permanent and essential part of our city's cultural calendar.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Perfect group separation (positive), perfect negative correlation, zero variance in sentiment_magnitude (demonstrates high positive intensity).\n*   **Strength rating:** 4\n\n*   **Document index:** 1\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"The success was so complete that it left no room for doubt or criticism.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Perfect group separation (positive), perfect negative correlation, zero variance in sentiment_magnitude (demonstrates high positive intensity).\n*   **Strength rating:** 4\n\n**Document 2 (Negative Sentiment, High Intensity)**\n\n*   **Document index:** 2\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"The collapse of the pension fund is a calamitous event, a direct result of years of gross mismanagement and unforgivable neglect.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Perfect group separation (negative), perfect negative correlation, zero variance in sentiment_magnitude (demonstrates high negative intensity).\n*   **Strength rating:** 5\n\n*   **Document index:** 2\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"This is a crisis born of systemic corruption and institutional decay.
