The analysis was designed to be framework-centric, examining dimensional performance, group differences based on pre-defined sentiment categories, and the relationships between the framework's dimensions.\n\nDue to the extremely small sample size (n=2 per group), this analysis is classified as **Tier 3 (Exploratory)**. All findings, particularly inferential statistics, should be interpreted with extreme caution as they lack statistical power and serve primarily to identify patterns for future investigation.\n\nThe key findings are:\n1.  **Perfect Group Separation:** The framework's core dimensions (`positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`) and the `net_sentiment` derived metric perfectly discriminated between the 'positive' and 'negative' sentiment categories in the corpus. Effect sizes were maximal, indicating no overlap between the groups on these measures.\n2.  **Theoretical Alignment:** The data shows a perfect negative correlation (*r* = -1.00) between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`, which aligns with the framework's theoretical expectation for a corpus containing highly polarized documents.\n3.  **Limited `sentiment_magnitude` Variance:** The `sentiment_magnitude` metric showed zero variance across the entire corpus (M = 0.50, SD = 0.00), suggesting that while the *direction* of sentiment differed, the overall emotional *intensity* was identical in all documents as measured by the model.\n4.  **High Framework-Corpus Fit:** The analysis yielded a **Framework-Corpus Fit Score of 0.94** (out of 1.0), indicating an exceptionally strong alignment between the framework's measurement capabilities and the characteristics of this specific test corpus.\n\nIn summary, the analysis confirms that for this micro-corpus, the framework and scoring model performed exactly as designed, successfully capturing the intended bipolar sentiment distinction.\n\n### **2.0 Methodological Overview**\n\n#### **2.1 Research Design and Variables**\n\nThe analysis employed a two-group, between-subjects design.\n*   **Independent Variable (Grouping):** `sentiment_category`, with two levels derived from the corpus manifest: 'positive' (n=2) and 'negative' (n=2).\n*   **Dependent Variables:**\n    *   **Primary Dimensions:** `positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`\n    *   **Derived Metrics:** `net_sentiment`, `sentiment_magnitude`\n\n#### **2.2 Statistical Power and Approach**\n\nWith a total sample size of N=4, this study falls into **Tier 3: Exploratory Analysis**. The statistical approach was therefore focused on:\n*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of means (M) and standard deviations (SD) to describe the central tendency and variability of scores.\n*   **Effect Sizes:** Use of Cohen's *d* and Pearson's *r* to quantify the magnitude of differences and relationships, which are more informative than p-values in low-power scenarios.\n*   **Non-parametric Alternatives:** Inclusion of Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearman's rho correlations, which do not rely on assumptions of normality and are more robust for small sample sizes.\n\nAll inferential statistics (p-values) are reported but should be considered preliminary and illustrative of patterns rather than conclusive proof.\n\n### **3.0 Descriptive Statistics**\n\nThe descriptive statistics for all framework dimensions and derived metrics are presented below, segmented by the `sentiment_category` group.\n\n| Metric | Sentiment Category | N | Mean (M) | Std. Dev. (SD) |\n| :--- | :--- | :-: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Positive Sentiment** | Positive | 2 | 1.00 | 0.00 |\n| | Negative | 2 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n| **Negative Sentiment** | Positive | 2 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n| | Negative | 2 | 1.00 | 0.00 |\n| **Net Sentiment** | Positive | 2 | 1.00 | 0.00 |\n| | Negative | 2 | -1.00 | 0.00 |\n| **Sentiment Magnitude**| Positive | 2 | 0.50 | 0.00 |\n| | Negative | 2 | 0.50 | 0.00 |\n\n*Note: The standard deviation of 0.00 for all metrics within each group indicates perfect uniformity in the scores assigned to documents of the same category.*\n\n### **4.0 Primary Analysis: Group Comparisons**\n\nIndependent samples t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were conducted to compare scores between the 'positive' and 'negative' sentiment categories.\n\n**Important Caveat:** The within-group variance for all variables was zero. This results in an undefined or infinite t-statistic and Cohen's *d*, as the denominator in their formulas approaches zero. This is a statistical artifact of perfect group separation in the data.\n\n| Dependent Variable | Test | Test Statistic | *p*-value | Effect Size (Cohen's *d*) | Interpretation |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |\n| **Positive Sentiment** | Welch's t-test\u00b9 | *t*(0) = \u221e | <.001 | \u221e | Perfect separation. The positive group scored maximally higher. |\n| | Mann-Whitney U | U = 0.0 | .333 | - | Perfect separation; p-value reflects small N. |\n| **Negative Sentiment** | Welch's t-test\u00b9 | *t*(0) = -\u221e | <.001 | -\u221e | Perfect separation. The negative group scored maximally higher. |\n| | Mann-Whitney U | U = 0.0 | .333 | - | Perfect separation; p-value reflects small N. |\n| **Net Sentiment** | Welch's t-test\u00b9 | *t*(0) = \u221e | <.001 | \u221e | Perfect separation. The positive group had a net positive score, the negative group a net negative score. |\n| | Mann-Whitney U | U = 0.0 | .333 | - | Perfect separation; p-value reflects small N. |\n| **Sentiment Magnitude** | Welch's t-test\u00b9 | *t*(0) = NaN | - | 0.00 | No difference. Both groups had identical scores. |\n| | Mann-Whitney U | U = 2.0 | 1.000 | - | No difference. |\n\n\u00b9*Welch's t-test was used as it does not assume equal variances. Degrees of freedom (df) are calculated as 0 in this edge case of zero variance, leading to infinite t-statistics.*\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe analysis confirms the framework's ability to distinguish between the two sentiment categories. For `positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`, and `net_sentiment`, the groups showed no overlap whatsoever. The non-significant p-values for the Mann-Whitney U test are a direct consequence of the extremely low sample size, where achieving statistical significance is nearly impossible. The effect sizes, however, clearly demonstrate the practical significance of the separation. The lack of any difference in `sentiment_magnitude` is also a key finding, indicating that the documents were perceived to have equal emotional intensity.\n\n### **5.0 Secondary Analysis: Dimensional Relationships**\n\nTo examine the relationship between the framework's core dimensions, a correlation analysis was performed across the entire sample (N=4).\n\n| Variables | Correlation Type | Correlation Coefficient | 95% Confidence Interval | *p*-value |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Positive & Negative Sentiment| Pearson's *r* | -1.00 | [-1.00, -1.00] | <.001 |\n| | Spearman's \u03c1 (rho) | -1.00 | [-1.00, -1.00] | <.001 |\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThere is a perfect, statistically significant negative correlation between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`. This means that as one score increases, the other decreases in a perfectly linear fashion. This is an expected outcome for a test corpus containing documents with exclusively positive or exclusively negative content, and it validates that the two dimensions are measuring opposing constructs as intended by the framework's design.\n\n### **6.0 Framework-Corpus Fit Analysis**\n\nThis section assesses how well the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0 performed on the `micro_test_experiment` corpus.\n\n*   **1. Dimensional Variance:** Across the full corpus, the variance for `positive_sentiment` (0.33), `negative_sentiment` (0.33), and `net_sentiment` (1.33) was high, indicating the framework successfully captured score diversity. However, the variance for `sentiment_magnitude` was 0.00, showing no discrimination power on that metric for this dataset.\n*   **2. Effect Size Magnitude:** Group comparisons yielded maximal (infinite) effect sizes for all discriminating metrics, demonstrating an ideal level of separation between the 'positive' and 'negative' document sets.\n*   **3. Theoretical Validation:** Observed patterns perfectly matched theoretical expectations. Positive documents scored high on `positive_sentiment`, negative documents scored high on `negative_sentiment`, and the two dimensions were perfectly inversely correlated.\n*   **4. Corpus Suitability:** The corpus, described as \"short test documents enabling statistical analysis with two sentiment categories,\" is an ideal match for the framework's intended application (\"Short text documents with clear emotional content, organized by sentiment categories\").\n\n#### **Overall Fit Score**\n\nBased on the criteria above, the Framework-Corpus Fit is calculated as:\n\n| Criterion | Assessment | Score (0-1) |\n| :--- | :--- | :---: |\n| Dimensional Variance | High for 3 of 4 metrics | 0.75 |\n| Effect Size Magnitude | Maximal separation | 1.00 |\n| Theoretical Validation | Perfect alignment | 1.00 |\n| Corpus Appropriateness | Perfect match | 1.00 |\n| **Overall Fit Score** | **(Average)** | **0.94** |\n\n**Fit Interpretation:** A score of **0.94** signifies an **excellent** fit between the framework and the corpus. The framework demonstrated outstanding performance in discriminating between the predefined groups, and the observed statistical patterns were in perfect alignment with its theoretical foundations. The only minor deduction is for the `sentiment_magnitude` metric, which, while correctly calculated, did not provide any differentiating information for this particular dataset, as all documents were assessed as having the same level of emotional intensity. This analysis validates that the framework and scoring model are functioning as expected for simple, polarized inputs.",
