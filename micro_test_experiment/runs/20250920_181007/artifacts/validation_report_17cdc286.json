      "description": "The experiment lists formal hypotheses (H1, H2) that imply comparative inferential testing, but the corpus sample size of N=4 (n=2 per group) is insufficient for such analysis. The Discernus v10.0 specification explicitly limits corpora of this size (N=4-9) to 'Case study analysis, qualitative patterns, individual document insights' and prohibits hypothesis testing.",
      "impact": "The platform's statistical guards will prevent the execution of inferential tests (like t-tests) due to the low sample size, meaning the formal hypotheses cannot be statistically tested. The analysis will be limited to the descriptive and pattern analysis goals, which are appropriate for the corpus size.",
      "fix": "To align the experiment's stated goals with its capabilities, reframe the hypotheses as descriptive expectations rather than falsifiable claims for statistical testing. For example: 'H1: It is expected that positive sentiment documents will show descriptively higher positive sentiment scores than negative sentiment documents.'",

      "description": "The corpus manifest uses `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, but the current standard is `v8.0.2`. The primary change in the newer version is the formal requirement for custom analytical grouping variables for statistical analysis.",
      "impact": "While this experiment is functionally compliant because it includes the necessary `sentiment_category` grouping variable, using an outdated spec version string can lead to validation warnings or compatibility issues with future platform updates that may enforce the version number more strictly.",
      "fix": "Update the `spec_version` field in the `corpus.md` YAML appendix from `\"8.0\"` to `\"8.0.2\"` to accurately reflect its compliance with current standards.",

    "Consider updating the framework's dimensions to the modern v10.0 specification format. Replacing the `scoring_guide` string with structured `markers` (including positive, negative, and boundary examples) and `scoring_calibration` objects will provide more precise guidance to the analysis agent and improve scoring reliability."
