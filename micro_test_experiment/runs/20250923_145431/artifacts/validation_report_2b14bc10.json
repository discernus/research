      "description": "The corpus has a total sample size of N=4, with two groups of n=2. This is below the threshold for inferential statistical testing.",
      "impact": "Analysis will be limited to descriptive statistics and qualitative pattern identification, as specified in the v10.0 experiment standard for N=4-9. Hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to determine statistically significant differences between groups is not possible.",
      "fix": "This is an informational warning. The experiment's 'Expected Outcomes' and 'Statistical Analysis Requirements' are appropriately aligned with a descriptive, case-study approach for a small sample size. No change is required for execution, but be mindful of the limited scope of statistical conclusions.",

      "description": "The framework dimensions use a free-text `scoring_guide`. The v10.0 specification recommends the more structured `scoring_calibration` object for improved LLM consistency.",
      "impact": "While functional, a free-text guide is less precise than a structured calibration object, which can lead to minor inconsistencies in how the analysis agent interprets the 0.0-1.0 scale across different runs or documents.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, consider replacing the `scoring_guide` string for each dimension with a `scoring_calibration` object. For example: `scoring_calibration: { high: '0.9-1.0: Dominant language throughout', medium: '0.4-0.6: Balanced or mixed sentiment', low: '0.1-0.3: Some elements present', absent: '0.0: Complete absence' }`.",

      "description": "The `sentiment_magnitude` derived metric involves division. While the current formula is safe (division by a constant 2), the v10.0 Framework spec promotes defensive programming for all ratios to prevent division-by-zero errors in more complex metrics.",
      "impact": "This is a best practice for creating robust, reusable framework components that are safe from edge-case failures where a denominator could evaluate to zero.",
      "fix": "For future, more complex ratio metrics where the denominator is a variable, consider a pattern like `(numerator) / (denominator + 0.001)`. No change is needed for the current metric, but this is a recommended practice.",
