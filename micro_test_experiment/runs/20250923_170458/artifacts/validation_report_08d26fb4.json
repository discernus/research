      "description": "The experiment is designed with a total sample size of N=4, comprising two groups of n=2. As correctly noted in the experiment abstract, this sample size is suitable only for descriptive statistics and qualitative pattern analysis, not for inferential statistical tests.",
      "impact": "The analysis pipeline will be restricted to generating descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, std dev) for each group. Hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) will be automatically disabled as the group sizes (n=2) do not meet the minimum requirements for statistical validity (n\u22652 with non-zero variance).",
      "fix": "No fix is required as the experiment's stated goal is descriptive analysis. This note serves as a formal confirmation of the analytical scope. To enable inferential statistics, each group would need to be expanded.",

      "description": "The corpus manifest `corpus.md` specifies `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, whereas the provided standard is v8.0.2. The experiment remains functional because the corpus correctly includes the `sentiment_category` metadata field required for statistical grouping.",
      "impact": "There is no immediate functional impact. However, using outdated specification versions can lead to validation warnings or compatibility issues if the platform deprecates support for older spec formats in the future.",
      "fix": "To align with current standards, update the `spec_version` field in the `corpus.md` YAML appendix to `\"8.0.2\"`.",

      "description": "The framework's dimensions use a `scoring_guide` field. The current v10.0 framework specification recommends a more structured approach using `markers` (with positive, negative, and boundary examples) and `scoring_calibration` (with explicit score ranges for high/medium/low/absent).",
      "impact": "The current format is functional. However, adopting the recommended v10.0 structure provides more precise guidance to the analysis agent, which can significantly improve scoring consistency and reliability, especially for more complex frameworks.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, consider refactoring the `scoring_guide` for each dimension into the more detailed `markers` and `scoring_calibration` objects as documented in the v10.0 framework specification.",
