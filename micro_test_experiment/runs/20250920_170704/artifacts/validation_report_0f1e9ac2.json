      "description": "The corpus manifest `corpus.md` specifies `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, while the current standard is `v8.0.2`. Although the experiment requires a `v8.0` compliant corpus and this meets the major version requirement, using an outdated patch version is not best practice.",
      "impact": "The experiment will execute correctly as the structure is valid for the v8.x family. However, this discrepancy could lead to confusion or prevent the use of features introduced in later patch versions of the specification. It is best practice to align with the latest patch version.",
      "fix": "Update the `spec_version` field in the `corpus.md` YAML appendix from `\"8.0\"` to `\"8.0.2\"` to conform to the latest standard.",

      "description": "Hypothesis H3, 'There are observable patterns between positive and negative sentiment groups in descriptive analysis', is framed as a falsifiable hypothesis but functions as an exploratory goal. The existence of some 'observable pattern' in any dataset is virtually guaranteed, making the hypothesis difficult to falsify.",
      "impact": "This does not block execution, as the descriptive analysis will proceed as planned. However, it represents a minor weakness in the formal research design.",
      "fix": "Consider rephrasing H3 to be more specific and falsifiable (e.g., 'Sentiment magnitude will be higher in the positive group than the negative group'), or re-labeling it as an 'Exploratory Goal' within the research questions section.",
