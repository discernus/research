      "description": "The framework's dimensions use a free-text 'scoring_guide' and the 'analysis_prompt' contains numeric score ranges (e.g., 0.9-1.0). The v10.0 specification recommends a more structured 'scoring_calibration' block and advises against providing numeric score examples in prompts to prevent LLM anchoring bias.",
      "impact": "LLM analysis may be less consistent across documents. Structured calibration improves scoring precision, and removing numeric examples from prompts reduces the risk of the model anchoring on those specific values.",
      "fix": "In framework.md, replace the 'scoring_guide' for each dimension with a structured 'scoring_calibration' block with 'high', 'medium', 'low', 'absent' keys. Remove the numeric score breakdowns from the 'analysis_prompt' to rely on descriptive anchors instead.",
