      "description": "In the experiment's hypotheses section, H1 and H2 are declared as 'mutually_exclusive: true', which is logically incorrect. It is possible for positive sentiment documents to have higher positive scores AND for negative sentiment documents to have higher negative scores within the same dataset.",
      "impact": "The formal hypothesis structure is logically flawed, which undermines the rigor of the stated research design. This does not block the execution of a descriptive analysis but renders the hypothesis section invalid for formal testing.",
      "fix": "Set 'mutually_exclusive: true' to 'false' for hypotheses H1 and H2 to accurately reflect their relationship. Also, review if they are 'collective_exhaustive' as the null case (no difference) is not represented.",

      "description": "The scoring guidance for sentiment dimensions is inconsistent within the framework file. The 'analysis_prompt' provides scoring ranges (e.g., '0.9-1.0: Dominant positive language'), while the 'scoring_guide' within the dimension definition provides discrete points (e.g., '1.0: Dominant positive language throughout').",
      "impact": "This creates ambiguity for the analysis agent and reduces scoring reliability. The agent may not interpret the 0.0-1.0 scale as intended if its primary prompt instructions conflict with the formal dimension definitions.",
      "fix": "Unify the scoring guidance. Either update the 'scoring_guide' in the dimension definitions to match the ranges in the 'analysis_prompt', or simplify the prompt to refer to the guide. A single, consistent definition is required for reliable analysis.",
