      "description": "The 'mutually_exclusive' and 'collective_exhaustive' flags for hypotheses H1 and H2 are set to 'true'. These conditions are not logically exclusive (e.g., a document can have both high positive and high negative scores) nor do they represent an exhaustive set of outcomes. This is a minor logical inconsistency in the research plan's metadata.",
      "impact": "This does not block execution but represents a logical inconsistency in the human-readable portion of the experiment specification, which may be confusing to other researchers.",
      "fix": "Review the logical properties of the hypotheses. It is likely that the 'mutually_exclusive' and 'collective_exhaustive' flags for H1, H2, and H3 should be set to 'false' as they describe independent, non-exhaustive conditions.",
