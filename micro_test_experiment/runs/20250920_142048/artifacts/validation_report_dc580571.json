      "fix": "Add a valid `output_schema` to the YAML appendix in `framework.md`. The schema must define the structure for `dimensional_scores` with properties for `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`, referencing a standard score object definition as shown in the v10.0 specification.",

The v10.0 specification standard is to reference the property, such as `dimensions.example_dimension_1.raw_score`.",
      "impact": "The formula engine may misinterpret the reference, potentially leading to calculation errors or unexpected behavior. While the engine may attempt to infer the correct property, explicit reference is required for robustness and compliance with best practices.",
      "fix": "Update the formulas to explicitly reference the `raw_score` of each dimension. For example, change `\"positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment\"` to `\"positive_sentiment.raw_score - negative_sentiment.raw_score\"`.",
