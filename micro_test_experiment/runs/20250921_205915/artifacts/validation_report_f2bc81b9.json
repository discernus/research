      "description": "The boolean flags `mutually_exclusive` and `collective_exhaustive` for the hypotheses may be logically inaccurate. For example, H1 ('Positive sentiment documents show higher positive sentiment scores') and H2 ('Negative sentiment documents show higher negative sentiment scores') can both be true simultaneously and are therefore not mutually exclusive.",
      "impact": "This does not affect automated execution or data analysis. However, it represents a minor logical inconsistency in the human-readable portion of the research plan which could be misinterpreted by readers of the experiment's specification.",
      "fix": "Review the logical relationship between the hypotheses and update the `mutually_exclusive` and `collective_exhaustive` flags to accurately reflect their relationships. It is acceptable for these flags to be `false`.",

  "suggestions": [
    "To improve agent reliability and fully leverage the v10 specification, consider enhancing the framework dimensions. Instead of defining scoring criteria solely in the `analysis_prompt` and a simple `scoring_guide`, use the structured `scoring_calibration` block and provide concrete examples using the `markers` block (with `positive_examples`, `negative_examples`, and `boundary_cases`). This provides more explicit guidance to the analysis agent and improves scoring consistency."
