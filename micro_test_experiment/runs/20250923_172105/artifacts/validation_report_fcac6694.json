      "description": "The framework's `dimensions` are defined using a basic structure with `definition` and `scoring_guide` fields. The v10.0 specification recommends using the more robust `markers` (with `positive_examples`, `negative_examples`) and `scoring_calibration` structures to improve LLM scoring consistency and accuracy.",
      "impact": "The current basic dimension definitions may lead to less reliable and consistent scoring by the analysis agent, as they lack the specific examples and calibration anchors needed to prevent conceptual drift and ambiguity.",
      "fix": "Update the `dimensions` in `framework.md` to use the v10.0 `markers` and `scoring_calibration` format. Provide concrete positive and negative examples for 'positive_sentiment' and 'negative_sentiment', and define the scoring scale from 0.0 to 1.0 with descriptive anchors.",

      "description": "The `analysis_prompt` in the 'default' analysis variant is minimal. The v10.0 specification provides a detailed template for prompts that establish an expert persona for the agent, outline the methodology, and clarify important conceptual distinctions, which significantly improves analysis quality.",
      "impact": "Without a detailed prompt, the analysis agent may perform a more generic sentiment analysis, potentially missing the specific theoretical grounding intended by the framework.",
      "fix": "Enhance the `analysis_prompt` in `framework.md` to follow the v10.0 best-practice template. Define an expert persona (e.g., 'You are an expert in sentiment analysis...'), provide framework-specific guidance, and clarify the methodology.",

      "description": "The experiment uses a total sample size of N=4, with two groups of n=2 each. This is below the recommended threshold for any inferential statistical testing.",
      "impact": "While sufficient for descriptive statistics and identifying qualitative patterns as stated in the experiment goals, no valid inferential statistical conclusions (e.g., from t-tests or ANOVA) can be drawn. Any observed differences between groups cannot be generalized and may be due to chance. The analysis will be limited to case-study-level insights.",
      "fix": "No fix is required as the experiment's stated goal is descriptive analysis. This is a formal notification of the statistical limitations. For future experiments requiring hypothesis testing, ensure each analysis group has a larger sample size.",
