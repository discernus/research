      "description": "The 'hypotheses' section in the experiment specification incorrectly claims the hypotheses are both 'mutually_exclusive' and 'collective_exhaustive'. Hypotheses H1 ('Positive sentiment documents show higher positive sentiment scores...') and H2 ('Negative sentiment documents show higher negative sentiment scores...') are not mutually exclusive, as both could be true. They are also not collectively exhaustive, as other outcomes are possible (e.g., no difference, or the opposite effect).",
      "impact": "This is a logical flaw in the formal research design and hypothesis declaration. It does not block execution, but it undermines the formal validity of the hypothesis testing framework as described.",
      "fix": "Review the logical properties of the hypotheses. Set the 'mutually_exclusive' and 'collective_exhaustive' flags to 'false' for H1 and H2, as they describe independent expectations for different metrics. Alternatively, redesign the hypotheses to be genuinely mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive if required.",

    "Consider enhancing the 'dimensions' in 'framework.md' to use the recommended 'markers' (with positive, negative, and boundary examples) and 'scoring_calibration' objects from the v10.0 Framework specification. This provides more detailed guidance to the analysis agent, potentially improving scoring consistency and accuracy."
