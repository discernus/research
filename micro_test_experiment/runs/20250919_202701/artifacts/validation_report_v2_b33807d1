      "description": "Inconsistent framework naming between the experiment's component reference and the framework's internal metadata. The `experiment.md` file references `sentiment_with_derived_metrics_v1.md`, but the framework's `metadata.framework_name` is `sentiment_binary_v1`.",
      "impact": "Causes confusion for future maintenance or reuse of the components, though it does not block execution as long as the file path is correct.",
      "fix": "To improve clarity and consistency, either rename the framework file to `sentiment_binary_v1.md` or update the `framework_name` metadata inside the framework to `sentiment_with_derived_metrics_v1`.",

      "description": "The logical properties `mutually_exclusive: true` and `collective_exhaustive: true` assigned to the hypotheses in `experiment.md` are incorrect. H1 (positive docs have higher positive scores) and H2 (negative docs have higher negative scores) can both be true simultaneously and are therefore not mutually exclusive. The set of H1, H2, and H3 is also not collectively exhaustive as it does not account for all possible outcomes.",
      "impact": "This represents a logical error in the formal research design, which weakens the experiment's rigor. It does not block the execution of the descriptive analysis.",
      "fix": "Review the definitions of mutual exclusivity and collective exhaustion. Update the boolean flags for hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 to accurately reflect their logical relationship. In this case, they should likely be set to `false`.",

      "description": "The description for the `sentiment_magnitude` derived metric is inconsistent within the framework specification. The abstract section describes it as `combined intensity ... (positive + negative)`, while the `derived_metrics` section and its formula define it as an average: `(positive + negative) / 2`.",
      "impact": "This creates minor confusion for a reader trying to understand the metric's definition. The calculation itself is unambiguous and will execute correctly.",
      "fix": "Unify the descriptions. It is recommended to change the abstract's description to `average emotional intensity` to match the formula and the specific description in the `derived_metrics` section.",
