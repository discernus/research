      "description": "The hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 are all marked as `mutually_exclusive: true` and `collective_exhaustive: true`. This is logically incorrect. H1 (positive docs have higher positive scores) and H2 (negative docs have higher negative scores) do not cover all possible outcomes (e.g., equal scores), so they are not collectively exhaustive. H3 (patterns exist) is a general statement for descriptive analysis and is not mutually exclusive with H1 or H2.",
      "impact": "This can lead to flawed logical conclusions during automated results synthesis. The system may incorrectly report on hypothesis testing outcomes because the specified logical constraints do not match the hypotheses' semantic content.",
      "fix": "Review the logical properties of the hypotheses. Adjust the `mutually_exclusive` and `collective_exhaustive` boolean flags to accurately reflect the relationships between them. For example, consider setting `collective_exhaustive: false` for H1 and H2, and re-evaluating the flags for H3 entirely.",

      "description": "The framework dimensions use a free-text `scoring_guide` field and include scoring rubrics in the main `analysis_prompt`. The v10 framework specification recommends using the structured `scoring_calibration` object with keys like `high`, `medium`, `low`, and `absent` for more reliable interpretation by analysis agents.",
      "impact": "While LLM agents can interpret free-text scoring guides, the lack of a structured format increases the risk of inconsistent scale interpretation (scale drift) across documents or future runs. The structured format is optimized for agent reliability.",
      "fix": "For each dimension, replace the `scoring_guide` field with a `scoring_calibration` object. Consolidate the scoring rubrics from the `analysis_prompt` into this structured object to create a single source of truth for scoring, as shown in the v10 framework specification.",
