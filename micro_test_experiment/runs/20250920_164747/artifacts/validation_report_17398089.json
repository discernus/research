      "description": "The derived metric formulas reference dimensions directly (e.g., `positive_sentiment`) instead of accessing their properties. The v10.0 specification requires referencing a specific property of the dimension object, such as `raw_score` (e.g., `dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score`).",
      "impact": "The formula execution engine will be unable to resolve the variable names, resulting in a runtime error and failure of the experiment.",
      "fix": "Update the formulas in `framework.md` to use the correct object-property access pattern. For example, change `'positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment'` to `'dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score - dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score'` and `' (positive_sentiment + negative_sentiment) / 2'` to `'(dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score + dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score) / 2'`.",

      "description": "The `output_schema` deviates from the v10.0 specification. It defines `evidence` and `marked_up_document` as top-level properties and omits `evidence` from the `score_object` definition. The specification requires `evidence` to be a string property within each dimension's `score_object`.",
      "impact": "The output from the analysis agent will not match the schema expected by downstream components, leading to a data validation failure during results processing.",
      "fix": "In `framework.md`, restructure the `output_schema`. Remove `evidence` and `marked_up_document` from the top-level `required` and `properties` lists. Add `evidence: { type: string }` to the `properties` of the `score_object` in `definitions` and add `\"evidence\"` to the `score_object`'s `required` list.",
