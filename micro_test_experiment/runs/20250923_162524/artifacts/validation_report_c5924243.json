      "description": "The framework `analysis_prompt` contains rubric-style scoring guides with explicit numerical ranges (e.g., '0.9-1.0: Dominant positive language'), which can cause anchoring bias in the analysis agent.",
      "impact": "This can bias the analysis agent towards the specified scores, reducing the granularity and objectivity of its ratings.",
      "fix": "Remove numerical ranges from the `analysis_prompt`. Instead, describe the qualitative characteristics of different score levels in prose. Use the `scoring_calibration` field within each dimension's YAML definition for the explicit score-to-description mapping, as per the v10.0 specification's best practices.",

      "description": "The dimensions in `framework.md` are defined using `definition` and a simple `scoring_guide`. The v10.0 framework specification recommends a more detailed structure including `description`, `markers` (with `positive_examples`, `negative_examples`, `boundary_cases`), and `scoring_calibration`.",
      "impact": "The current simplified structure provides less guidance to the analysis agent, which can lead to lower accuracy, inconsistent scoring, and poorer evidence selection.",
      "fix": "Update the `dimensions` section in `framework.md` to use the richer v10.0 structure. For each dimension, add `markers` and `scoring_calibration` sections to provide concrete examples, counter-examples, and clear scoring anchors for the analysis agent.",

      "impact": "While the v10.0 pipeline maintains backward compatibility, using an outdated specification may prevent access to newer features and creates a version inconsistency across the experiment's components.",
      "fix": "Consider migrating the `corpus.md` file to the latest specification version. The current structure is simple and migration would primarily involve updating the `spec_version` field to conform to the latest standard.",
