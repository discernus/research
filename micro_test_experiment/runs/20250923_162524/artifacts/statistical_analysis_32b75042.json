Executive Summary**\n\nThis report presents a statistical analysis of the `micro_test_experiment` corpus (N=4) using the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0. The analysis was conducted to validate the framework's ability to discriminate between documents pre-categorized as 'positive' and 'negative'.\n\nDue to the small sample size (n=2 per group), this study is classified as a **Tier 3 Exploratory Analysis**. The methodology focuses on descriptive statistics and effect sizes rather than inferential tests (e.g., t-tests), which are not appropriate for this sample size.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n*   **Perfect Discrimination:** The framework demonstrated perfect discrimination between the 'positive' and 'negative' sentiment categories. Documents in the positive category scored maximally on `positive_sentiment` (M=1.00) and minimally on `negative_sentiment` (M=0.00), with the reverse pattern observed for the negative category.\n*   **Maximal Effect Sizes:** The differences between groups on the `positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`, and `net_sentiment` metrics were so complete (i.e., no overlap in scores and zero in-group variance) that the resulting effect size (Cohen's *d*) is infinite. This indicates a perfect, non-overlapping separation between the groups, confirming the framework's efficacy on this test corpus.\n*   **Dimensional Invariance:** The `sentiment_magnitude` metric, representing emotional intensity, was constant across all documents (M=0.50, SD=0.00). This is an expected artifact of the test data, where all documents were designed to be maximally and singly polarized (e.g., score of 1.0 on one dimension and 0.0 on the other).\n*   **High Framework-Corpus Fit (0.88/1.00):** The analysis yielded a very high framework-corpus fit score, indicating that the framework performed as theoretically expected and was well-suited to the validation task posed by this corpus.\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis confirms that the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0 and the associated scoring model function correctly, successfully identifying and quantifying sentiment as designed within this controlled test environment.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Statistical Methodology**\n\n#### **Analysis Approach**\nFollowing the provided protocol, the analysis was guided by the sample size. With a total of four documents (two per group), a **Tier 3 (Exploratory) Analysis** was performed. The primary statistical tools are:\n1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (M), Standard Deviation (SD), Minimum (Min), and Maximum (Max) were calculated to summarize the central tendency and dispersion of scores.\n2.  **Effect Sizes:** Cohen's *d* was calculated to quantify the magnitude of the difference between the 'positive' and 'negative' groups. This metric is valuable in small samples as it focuses on the size of the effect, independent of statistical significance.\n3.  **Correlation Analysis:** A Pearson correlation was calculated to examine the relationship between the two primary dimensions.\n\n#### **Data Preparation**\nAnalysis data was aggregated from four document scores. A `sentiment_category` grouping variable was created by mapping each document to its category ('positive' or 'negative') as defined in the corpus manifest.\n\n*   **Independent Variable:** `sentiment_category` (Levels: 'positive', 'negative')\n*   **Dependent Variables:**\n    *   `positive_sentiment` (Dimension)\n    *   `negative_sentiment` (Dimension)\n    *   `net_sentiment` (Derived Metric)\n    *   `sentiment_magnitude` (Derived Metric)\n\n---\n\n### **3. Corpus-Wide Descriptive Statistics**\n\nThis table summarizes the statistical properties of all measured variables across the entire corpus (N=4).\n\n| Metric                | Mean | SD   | Min    | Max  |\n| --------------------- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ---- |\n| `positive_sentiment`  | 0.50 | 0.58 | 0.00   | 1.00 |\n| `negative_sentiment`  | 0.50 | 0.58 | 0.00   | 1.00 |\n| `net_sentiment`       | 0.00 | 1.15 | -1.00  | 1.00 |\n| `sentiment_magnitude` | 0.50 | 0.00 | 0.50   | 0.50 |\n\n*Note: All values are rounded to two decimal places per APA guidelines.*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Group-Based Comparative Analysis**\n\nThis section examines the differences in scores between the 'positive' (n=2) and 'negative' (n=2) document categories.\n\n#### **4.1. Descriptive Statistics by Sentiment Category**\n\nThe framework's dimensions effectively separated the two groups, with no variance within either group.\n\n| Metric                | Group      | Mean | SD   |\n| --------------------- | ---------- | ---- | ---- |\n| `positive_sentiment`  | **Positive** | 1.00 | 0.00 |\n|                       | **Negative** | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n| `negative_sentiment`  | **Positive** | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n|                       | **Negative** | 1.00 | 0.00 |\n| `net_sentiment`       | **Positive** | 1.00 | 0.00 |\n|                       | **Negative** | -1.00| 0.00 |\n| `sentiment_magnitude` | **Positive** | 0.50 | 0.00 |\n|                       | **Negative** | 0.50 | 0.00 |\n\n#### **4.2. Group Difference Analysis (Effect Sizes)**\n\nThe effect sizes highlight the magnitude of the separation between the groups.\n\n| Metric                | Mean Difference (Pos - Neg) | Cohen's d | Interpretation           |\n| --------------------- | --------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------ |\n| `positive_sentiment`  | 1.00                        | Infinity  | Perfect Separation       |\n| `negative_sentiment`  | -1.00                       | Infinity  | Perfect Separation       |\n| `net_sentiment`       | 2.00                        | Infinity  | Perfect Separation       |\n| `sentiment_magnitude` | 0.00                        | 0.00      | No Difference          |\n\n**Interpretation of Infinite Effect Size:** A Cohen's *d* value of infinity occurs when the pooled standard deviation in the denominator is zero. This happens when there is no variability within the groups being compared. In this context, it is the highest possible indicator of discriminant validity, signifying that the score distributions for the 'positive' and 'negative' groups are perfectly separated with no overlap. This result validates that the framework performed its primary function flawlessly on this test corpus.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Dimensional Relationship Analysis**\n\nTo understand the interplay between the framework's core dimensions, the correlation between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` was examined.\n\n*   **Pearson Correlation:** *r*(2) = -1.00\n\nA perfect negative correlation (*r* = -1.00) was observed between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`. This indicates that as the score for one dimension increases, the score for the other decreases in a perfectly linear fashion. This is an expected and desirable outcome for this simple, bipolar framework applied to a corpus of documents with unambiguous sentiment, confirming that the dimensions are behaving as conceptual opposites.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Framework-Corpus Fit Assessment**\n\nThis assessment evaluates how well the framework performed on the given corpus.\n\n**Overall Fit Score: 0.88 / 1.00**\n\n| Component                 | Score (0-1) | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Dimensional Variance**    | 0.75        | Three of the four metrics (`positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`, `net_sentiment`) showed strong variance across the corpus. `sentiment_magnitude` had zero variance, as expected. |\n| **Effect Size**           | 0.75        | Three of the four metrics produced infinite effect sizes, indicating maximal group separation. `sentiment_magnitude` showed no effect, as expected by the data design.              |\n| **Theoretical Alignment** | 1.00        | The observed scores perfectly matched the theoretical expectations. Positive documents scored high on positive sentiment, and the `net_sentiment` metric correctly reflected the balance. |\n| **Corpus Suitability**    | 1.00        | The corpus, containing short documents with clear, distinct sentiment categories, is an ideal match for the framework's intended application as a validation tool.                       |\n\n**Interpretation:** The Framework-Corpus Fit score of **0.88** is exceptionally high. It signifies that the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0 is functioning precisely as intended for this validation task. The framework dimensions and derived metrics successfully discriminated between the sentiment categories with perfect clarity. The only metric without variance, `sentiment_magnitude`, behaved as predicted given the uniform emotional intensity of the test documents. This confirms the validity of the analytical pipeline for this framework.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Conclusion & Limitations**\n\nThis exploratory analysis confirms that the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0 successfully and accurately quantifies sentiment in the `micro_test_experiment` corpus. The framework demonstrated perfect discriminant validity, separating documents into their intended sentiment categories with maximal effect sizes. The internal structure of the framework behaved as expected, with its two core dimensions showing a perfect inverse relationship.\n\nThe primary limitation of this analysis is its **exploratory nature** due to the extremely small sample size (N=4). The findings demonstrate the framework's functionality in a controlled environment but cannot be generalized to a broader population of texts. The results serve as a successful proof-of-concept for the analytical pipeline rather than a substantive finding about sentiment in general.",
