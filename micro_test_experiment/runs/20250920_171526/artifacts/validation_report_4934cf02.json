      "description": "The boolean flags for the hypotheses are logically inconsistent. Hypotheses H1 ('Positive docs have higher positive scores') and H2 ('Negative docs have higher negative scores') are not mutually exclusive, as it is possible for both to be true simultaneously. They are also not collectively exhaustive, as they do not account for the null hypothesis (no difference in scores).",
      "impact": "This represents a flaw in the logical design of the research questions. While it does not block execution, it could lead to misinterpretation of the results as the hypotheses are not correctly defined.",
      "fix": "Review the logical properties of the hypotheses. For H1 and H2, set `mutually_exclusive` and `collective_exhaustive` to `false`. H3 is more of an analytical expectation than a falsifiable hypothesis and its properties should be reconsidered.",
