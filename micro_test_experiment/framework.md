# Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0

## Abstract & Raison d'Ãªtre

**What is this framework?**
A minimalist framework for measuring basic positive vs negative sentiment with derived metrics to validate complete pipeline functionality including statistical analysis.

**What problem does it solve?**
Provides a framework that triggers derived metrics calculation and statistical analysis while maintaining minimal computational cost.

**Who is it for?**
Test suite developers and pipeline maintainers who need to validate the complete pipeline including calculation agents and statistical synthesis.

## Theoretical & Empirical Foundations

This framework is grounded in basic sentiment analysis theory, measuring the presence of positive and negative emotional language in text with derived balance metrics.

**Key Citations:**
- Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2008). Opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 2(1-2), 1-135. This foundational work established the theoretical basis for computational sentiment analysis.
- Liu, B. (2012). Sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies, 5(1), 1-167. Provides comprehensive theoretical foundations for sentiment analysis methodologies.

## Analytical Methodology

**Dimensions:**
- Positive Sentiment (0.0-1.0): Presence of positive language and optimistic expressions
- Negative Sentiment (0.0-1.0): Presence of negative language and pessimistic expressions

**Derived Metrics:**
- Net Sentiment: Balance between positive and negative sentiment (positive - negative)
- Sentiment Magnitude: Average emotional intensity (positive + negative) / 2

## Intended Application & Corpus Fit

**Target Corpus Description**: Short text documents with clear emotional content, organized by sentiment categories for statistical comparison.

**Known Limitations**: Designed for testing purposes only, not for serious sentiment analysis.

      You are analyzing text for sentiment. Score 0.0-1.0 for each dimension.

      POSITIVE SENTIMENT: Look for praise, optimism, success words, enthusiasm
      - 0.9-1.0: Dominant positive language throughout
      - 0.7-0.8: Strong positive elements present
      - 0.4-0.6: Balanced or mixed sentiment
      - 0.1-0.3: Some positive elements but mostly neutral/negative
      - 0.0: No positive sentiment detected

      NEGATIVE SENTIMENT: Look for criticism, pessimism, failure words, disappointment
      - 0.9-1.0: Dominant negative language throughout
      - 0.7-0.8: Strong negative elements present
      - 0.4-0.6: Balanced or mixed sentiment
      - 0.1-0.3: Some negative elements but mostly neutral/positive
      - 0.0: No negative sentiment detected
