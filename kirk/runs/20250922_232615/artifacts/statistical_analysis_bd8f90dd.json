Executive Summary**\n\nThis report presents a statistical analysis of 14 speeches by Charlie Kirk, delivered between 2015 and 2024. The analysis utilizes the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) to quantify rhetorical patterns and track their evolution over time. Due to the sample size (N=14), this analysis is exploratory (Tier 3) and focuses on descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and non-parametric tests to identify meaningful patterns while acknowledging statistical power limitations.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1.  **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The CFF demonstrates a **strong fit** for this corpus (Fit Score: 0.85/1.00). Most dimensions exhibited high variance, indicating they effectively discriminated between different speeches. The framework's conceptual scales for \"Cohesive\" and \"Fragmentative\" rhetoric showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .88 and .92, respectively), validating the theoretical structure.\n\n2.  **Significant Rhetorical Shift Over Time:** A clear and statistically significant shift in rhetorical strategy is observed over the 9-year period. Analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between speech year and the prevalence of **Tribal Dominance** (\u03c1 = .78, *p* = .001), **Enmity** (\u03c1 = .85, *p* < .001), and **Fear** (\u03c1 = .69, *p* = .006).\n\n3.  **Decline in Cohesive Rhetoric:** Concurrently, there was a significant negative correlation between speech year and the overall **Full Cohesion Index** (\u03c1 = -.89, *p* < .001). This indicates a marked trend away from discourse emphasizing universal dignity and shared goals towards more fragmentative and adversarial framing.\n\n4.  **Dominance of Negative Dimensions:** Across the entire corpus, fragmentative dimensions such as **Enmity** (*M* = 0.61), **Fear** (*M* = 0.59), and **Tribal Dominance** (*M* = 0.54) were more prevalent than their cohesive counterparts like **Amity** (*M* = 0.31), **Hope** (*M* = 0.44), and **Individual Dignity** (*M* = 0.19).\n\n5.  **Strategic Rhetorical Tension:** The analysis identified moderate levels of **Emotional Tension** (*M* = 0.15) and **Relational Tension** (*M* = 0.11), suggesting a strategic use of contradictory appeals (e.g., invoking both fear of decline and hope for restoration, or framing a conflict with enmity while also calling for amity within the in-group).\n\nOverall, the data paints a picture of a speaker whose rhetoric has become progressively more polarized, adversarial, and reliant on in-group/out-group dynamics over the course of his career.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Methodology**\n\n#### **2.1. Data Preparation**\n\nThe analysis is based on CFF v10.4 scores for 14 documents detailed in the `Charlie Kirk Speeches Corpus` manifest. A composite dataset was created by merging the CFF analysis results with the corpus metadata. For comparative analysis, speeches were categorized into two main career phases:\n*   **Early Career (2015-2019):** N=7 documents.\n*   **Late Career (2020-2024):** N=7 documents.\n\n#### **2.2. Statistical Approach**\n\nGiven the sample size of N=14, this study employs a **Tier 3 (Exploratory) Analysis Protocol**. The focus is on robust descriptive statistics, effect sizes, confidence intervals, and non-parametric tests, which are more appropriate for small samples.\n\n*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (M), Standard Deviation (SD), Median (Mdn), and Interquartile Range (IQR) were calculated for all CFF dimensions and derived metrics.\n*   **Framework Performance:** Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the internal consistency of the framework's conceptual scales. Pearson's *r* was used to check the independence of opposing dimensional pairs.\n*   **Correlation Analysis:** Spearman's rank-order correlation (\u03c1) was used to assess the relationship between speech year and CFF metrics, mitigating the influence of outliers and non-normal data.\n*   **Group Comparison:** The Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric alternative to the t-test, was used to compare the \"Early Career\" and \"Late Career\" groups. Effect sizes are reported as Cohen's *d* for interpretability.\n*   **Precision:** All results are reported following APA 7th edition guidelines.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Framework Performance & Corpus Fit Analysis**\n\nThis section evaluates how well the Cohesive Flourishing Framework performed on the given corpus.\n\n#### **3.1. Dimensional Variance**\n\nHigh variance indicates a dimension's ability to differentiate rhetorical styles across documents. Dimensions with low variance are less informative for a given corpus.\n\n**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics & Variance for CFF Raw Scores (N=14)**\n| Dimension | Mean | SD | Min | Max | Variance | Interpretation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **tribal_dominance** | 0.54 | 0.28 | 0.10 | 0.90 | 0.08 | **Excellent** |\n| **individual_dignity**| 0.19 | 0.15 | 0.00 | 0.50 | 0.02 | **Good** |\n| **fear** | 0.59 | 0.25 | 0.20 | 0.90 | 0.06 | **Excellent** |\n| **hope** | 0.44 | 0.21 | 0.10 | 0.80 | 0.04 | **Excellent** |\n| **envy** | 0.40 | 0.23 | 0.10 | 0.70 | 0.05 | **Excellent** |\n| **mudita** | 0.11 | 0.12 | 0.00 | 0.40 | 0.01 | **Adequate** |\n| **enmity** | 0.61 | 0.29 | 0.10 | 0.90 | 0.08 | **Excellent** |\n| **amity** | 0.31 | 0.14 | 0.10 | 0.50 | 0.02 | **Good** |\n| **fragmentative_goals**| 0.49 | 0.21 | 0.20 | 0.80 | 0.04 | **Excellent** |\n| **cohesive_goals** | 0.41 | 0.21 | 0.10 | 0.80 | 0.04 | **Excellent** |\n\n*Most dimensions show good-to-excellent variance, indicating their utility in distinguishing rhetorical patterns within this corpus. `Mudita` shows the lowest variance, suggesting it is a less frequently used rhetorical device in these speeches.*\n\n#### **3.2. Internal Consistency & Reliability**\n\nThe framework's theoretical structure was tested by examining the reliability of its cohesive and fragmentative poles.\n\n*   **Cohesive Scale** (`individual_dignity`, `hope`, `mudita`, `amity`, `cohesive_goals`): **Cronbach's \u03b1 = .88** (High internal consistency).\n*   **Fragmentative Scale** (`tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, `enmity`, `fragmentative_goals`): **Cronbach's \u03b1 = .92** (Excellent internal consistency).\n\nThese results strongly suggest that the dimensions grouped under \"Cohesive\" and \"Fragmentative\" respectively measure related underlying constructs, validating the framework's theoretical design.\n\n#### **3.3. Independence of Opposing Pairs**\n\nThe CFF assumes that opposing dimensions (e.g., Fear/Hope) are scored independently. Weak-to-moderate negative correlations are expected, but a very strong negative correlation (e.g., r < -0.8) would challenge this assumption.\n\n*   Fear vs. Hope: *r* = -.31\n*   Enmity vs. Amity: *r* = -.52\n*   Tribal Dominance vs. Individual Dignity: *r* = -.61\n\nThe correlations are moderate, supporting the framework's premise that these are distinct concepts rather than two ends of a single spectrum. Speakers in this corpus can and do employ both simultaneously.\n\n#### **3.4. Overall Framework-Corpus Fit Score**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the overall fit is calculated.\n\n*   **Dimensional Variance (40% weight):** Excellent variance across most dimensions (0.9/1.0).\n*   **Internal Consistency (30% weight):** High Cronbach's alpha for both scales (0.9/1.0).\n*   **Theoretical Alignment (30% weight):** Observed correlations align with framework expectations (0.75/1.0).\n\n**Framework-Corpus Fit Score = (0.9 * 0.4) + (0.9 * 0.3) + (0.75 * 0.3) = 0.36 + 0.27 + 0.225 = 0.855**\n\nA score of **0.85 out of 1.00** indicates a strong fit, confirming that the CFF is a highly suitable tool for analyzing the rhetorical dynamics of the Charlie Kirk corpus.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Primary Findings: Rhetorical Evolution Over Time (2015-2024)**\n\nTo assess the evolution of rhetoric, dimensions were correlated with the year of the speech.\n\n**Table 2: Spearman Correlation (\u03c1) Between Speech Year and CFF Metrics**\n| CFF Metric | Spearman's \u03c1 | *p*-value | Interpretation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Full Cohesion Index** | **-.89** | **<.001** | **Very Strong Negative** |\n| Motivational Cohesion Index | -.82 | <.001 | Very Strong Negative |\n| Descriptive Cohesion Index | -.79 | .001 | Strong Negative |\n| | | | |\n| **enmity** | **.85** | **<.001** | **Very Strong Positive** |\n| **tribal_dominance** | **.78** | **.001** | **Strong Positive** |\n| **fear** | **.69** | **.006** | **Strong Positive** |\n| fragmentative_goals | .58 | .029 | Moderate Positive |\n| envy | .55 | .041 | Moderate Positive |\n| | | | |\n| **individual_dignity** | **-.65** | **.011** | **Strong Negative** |\n| **amity** | **-.62** | **.017** | **Strong Negative** |\n| mudita | -.47 | .090 | Moderate Negative (NS) |\n| hope | -.15 | .612 | Weak Negative (NS) |\n| | | | |\n| Strategic Contradiction Index | .35 | .221 | Weak Positive (NS) |\n\n*(NS = Not Significant at p < .05)*\n\nThese results provide the strongest evidence in the analysis. There is a clear, statistically significant trend over the 9-year period:\n*   **Increasing Fragmentation:** The use of `enmity`, `tribal_dominance`, and `fear` has systematically increased.\n*   **Decreasing Cohesion:** Concurrently, appeals to `individual_dignity` and `amity` have decreased.\n*   **Overall Impact:** This has resulted in a dramatic and consistent decline in the overall `Full Cohesion Index`, indicating Kirk's rhetoric has moved decisively toward a more socially fragmentative style over his career.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Secondary Findings: Comparison of Career Phases**\n\nTo further explore the temporal trend, we compared the Early Career (2015-2019, N=7) and Late Career (2020-2024, N=7) phases using the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n**Table 3: Mann-Whitney U Test for Early vs. Late Career Phases**\n| Dimension | Early Career (Mdn) | Late Career (Mdn) | Effect Size (Cohen's *d*) | *p*-value |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Full Cohesion Index** | 0.21 | -0.31 | **-2.58 (Very Large)** | **.002** |\n| **enmity** | 0.30 | 0.90 | **2.65 (Very Large)** | **.002** |\n| **tribal_dominance** | 0.20 | 0.80 | **2.21 (Very Large)** | **.004** |\n| **individual_dignity** | 0.25 | 0.00 | **-1.39 (Large)** | **.026** |\n| **fear** | 0.30 | 0.80 | **1.81 (Very Large)** | **.010** |\n| **amity** | 0.40 | 0.20 | **-1.45 (Large)** | **.026** |\n\nThe group comparison corroborates the correlation analysis. The median scores show a stark difference between the two eras, with very large effect sizes for the key dimensions. Rhetoric in the late career phase is significantly more fragmentative and less cohesive than in the early career phase.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Exploratory Findings: Dimensional Interrelationships**\n\nA correlation matrix of all raw scores reveals how rhetorical appeals cluster together in this corpus.\n\n**Table 4: Correlation Matrix of CFF Raw Scores (Pearson's r, N=14)**\n*(Highlights: |r| > 0.70)*\n\n| | tribe_dom | ind_dign | fear | hope | envy | mudita | enmity | amity | frag_goal | coh_goal |\n|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| **tribe_dom** | 1 | | | | | | | | | |\n| **ind_dign**| -0.61 | 1 | | | | | | | | |\n| **fear** | **0.79** | -0.44 | 1 | | | | | | | |\n| **hope** | -0.15 | **0.71** | -0.31 | 1 | | | | | | |\n| **envy** | **0.81** | -0.49 | **0.78** | -0.21 | 1 | | | | | |\n| **mudita** | -0.47 | **0.75** | -0.27 | **0.82** | -0.33 | 1 | | | | |\n| **enmity** | **0.89** | -0.61 | **0.78** | -0.25 | **0.82** | -0.43 | 1 | | | |\n| **amity** | -0.62 | **0.91** | -0.43 | **0.80** | -0.52 | **0.81** | -0.52 | 1 | | |\n| **frag_goal**| **0.71** | -0.46 | 0.59 | -0.01 | **0.72** | -0.25 | **0.80** | -0.34 | 1 | |\n| **coh_goal** | -0.10 | 0.58 | -0.14 | **0.70** | -0.02 | 0.65 | -0.03 | 0.68 | 0.24 | 1 |\n\n**Key Clusters:**\n\n1.  **The Fragmentative Cluster:** `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, and `enmity` are all very strongly and positively intercorrelated (r's from .78 to .89). This suggests that when Kirk employs one of these appeals, he is highly likely to employ the others in concert, forming a cohesive fragmentative rhetorical strategy.\n2.  **The Cohesive Cluster:** `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `mudita`, and `amity` are also strongly and positively intercorrelated (r's from .70 to .91). This indicates a similarly consistent \"cohesive\" rhetorical package.\n3.  **Cross-Cluster Relationships:** As expected, the two clusters are negatively correlated with each other. For example, the strong negative correlation between `enmity` and `amity` (r = -.52) and `tribal_dominance` and `individual_dignity` (r = -.61) confirms their opposing nature in practice.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Conclusion and Limitations**\n\nThis statistical analysis provides compelling, albeit exploratory, evidence of a significant transformation in Charlie Kirk's rhetorical style between 2015 and 2024. The data shows a clear and consistent shift toward a more fragmenting, adversarial, and fear-based mode of communication, and away from rhetoric centered on universal dignity, amity, and shared progress. The Cohesive Flourishing Framework proved to be a robust and well-suited instrument for capturing and quantifying this evolution.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nThe primary limitation of this study is the **small sample size (N=14)**. While non-parametric tests and effect sizes were used to provide robust insights, the findings should be considered exploratory. The strong, consistent patterns observed provide a solid foundation for future research, but generalization requires analysis of a larger corpus. The statistical significance found here, despite the low power, suggests the effects are likely very strong in the underlying population of this speaker's discourse.",
