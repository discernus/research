### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of 14 speeches by Charlie Kirk from 2015 to 2024, utilizing the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. The primary objective of this exploratory study was to quantify rhetorical patterns and assess their evolution over a nine-year period. Given the pilot nature of this analysis (N=14), all findings are presented as preliminary and suggestive, employing non-parametric statistical methods appropriate for a small sample size to identify significant trends and patterns.

The central finding of this analysis is a clear, statistically significant, and substantial evolution in the subject's rhetorical strategy over time. The data reveals a systematic shift from a moderately cohesive style in his early career (2015-2019) to a predominantly fragmentative and adversarial style in his later career (2020-2024). This transformation is quantitatively demonstrated by a very strong negative correlation between the speech year and the `Full Cohesion Index` (Spearman's ρ = -0.89, *p* < .001), a composite measure of discourse quality derived from the framework. This indicates a marked decline in rhetoric associated with social cohesion. For instance, while earlier discourse emphasized shared national identity, as when Charlie Kirk stated: "Eploribus unum means out of many one. Means one people. Because if you actually look, most civilizations in human history were formed on divisions and formed on tribalism. It was really a first major experiment that said, no, we're going to focus on similarities, not differences." (Source: Document 12), later speeches adopted a starkly different tone, exemplified by the declaration: "But if you come from Somalia and you refuse to learn our language, adopt to our customs and assimilate, I'm sorry, America is closed to the third world until further notice. We are not a dumping ground for the rest of the planet." (Source: Document 13).

This rhetorical shift is driven by a statistically significant increase in the use of fragmentative appeals. Specifically, the analysis identifies very strong positive correlations between the speech year and the prevalence of `Enmity` (ρ = 0.85, *p* < .001), `Tribal Dominance` (ρ = 0.78, *p* = .001), and `Fear` (ρ = 0.69, *p* = .006). Concurrently, a significant decrease was observed in cohesive appeals such as `Individual Dignity` (ρ = -0.65, *p* = .011) and `Amity` (ρ = -0.62, *p* = .017). Methodologically, the CFF proved to be an effective instrument for this corpus, demonstrating a strong framework-corpus fit (0.85/1.00), high internal consistency for its theoretical scales (Cronbach's α > .88), and robust discriminatory power across its dimensions. These preliminary findings suggest a pronounced and quantifiable trajectory toward a more polarizing communication style over the course of the subject's public career.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Systematic Rhetorical Shift Detected**: The analysis reveals a statistically significant and consistent shift in rhetorical strategy over the nine-year period. The overall `Full Cohesion Index` shows a very strong negative correlation with time (ρ = -0.89, *p* < .001), indicating a quantifiable move away from cohesive discourse. This is vividly illustrated by the contrast between an early focus on universal progress, as Charlie Kirk noted: "The last 100 years, the standard of living increase for all people across the world." (Source: Document 4), and a later prioritization of specific in-groups, stating: "American college graduates should come first... Starting with those of you that are looking for a job, you should not have to compete against a foreigner for your job." (Source: Document 13).
*   **Rise of Fragmentative Appeals**: The subject's later rhetoric (2020-2024) is characterized by a significantly higher prevalence of fragmentative dimensions. The use of `Enmity` (adversarial framing), `Tribal Dominance` (in-group supremacy), and `Fear` (crisis mentality) all show strong, statistically significant positive correlations with the speech year. For example, the increasing prevalence of `Enmity` is evident in statements like: "So the vision of our opponents and the Marxist totalitarian left is filled with venom, hatred, darkness, resentment, arrogance, and despair." (Source: Document 10). Similarly, `Tribal Dominance` is clearly articulated when Charlie Kirk asserts: "Any Republican that takes money from NetPak or from Google should leave the Republican party. Any Republican that is funded by Google has no place in the Republican party." (Source: Document 7). The heightened sense of `Fear` is captured by the declaration: "Our country is literally dying, and I don't mean that in the abstract way that hysterical politicians sometimes mean it. I mean it in a really basic way. More of us are dying than are being born." (Source: Document 13).
*   **Decline of Cohesive Appeals**: Correspondingly, the data shows a significant decline in rhetoric associated with social cohesion. Appeals to `Individual Dignity` (universal human worth) and `Amity` (cooperative framing) became significantly less frequent in the later career phase compared to the early phase. While earlier speeches might emphasize shared democratic processes, as a moderator stated: "this is American democracy at work. This is about a competition of ideas. And since the founding of this country, this is really what it was all about." (Source: Document 4), later rhetoric often frames internal divisions as externally manipulated, as Charlie Kirk observed: "We, the American people, are not each other's enemies. But we have people who are manipulating us on the basis of race, age, gender, trying to divide us and make us into enemies." (Source: Document 13).
*   **Framework Validity Confirmed**: The CFF demonstrated strong construct validity and reliability on this corpus. The framework's "Cohesive" and "Fragmentative" scales showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .88 and .92, respectively). Furthermore, analysis of inter-dimensional correlations revealed two distinct rhetorical clusters—a "Fragmentative Cluster" and a "Cohesive Cluster"—that align perfectly with the framework's theoretical design.
*   **High Framework-Corpus Fit**: The CFF was found to be highly suitable for analyzing this type of political discourse, achieving a framework-corpus fit score of 0.85 out of 1.00. High variance across most dimensions indicates the framework effectively discriminated between the rhetorical styles present in different speeches.
*   **Strategic Rhetorical Packages Identified**: The analysis uncovered two coherent and opposing rhetorical strategies. A "Fragmentative Package" strongly links `Enmity`, `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`, and `Envy`. A "Cohesive Package" links `Individual Dignity`, `Amity`, `Hope`, and `Mudita`. The temporal analysis shows a clear strategic shift from deploying elements of the latter to a near-total reliance on the former. This is evident in the way hope is often intertwined with an adversarial stance in later speeches, as Charlie Kirk stated: "What gives me hope is that what we see on these campuses is a generation that understands the only way you beat the left is you never give up and you never give them an inch, period." (Source: Document 10).

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This analysis is grounded in the theoretical foundations of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF), which integrates concepts from deliberative democracy theory, social psychology, and political communication. The CFF operationalizes key theoretical constructs to allow for their empirical measurement in textual data.

The framework's core structure, comprising five oppositional axes (e.g., Identity, Emotional Climate), is designed to test propositions from deliberative democratic theory (Gutmann & Thompson, 1996; Habermas, 1996). This tradition posits that discourse quality—characterized by inclusivity, reciprocity, and a focus on common good—is essential for democratic legitimacy. The CFF's "cohesive" dimensions, such as `Individual Dignity` and `Cohesive Goals`, provide quantitative proxies for these deliberative ideals, while "fragmentative" dimensions like `Tribal Dominance` and `Fragmentative Goals` measure their antithesis.

The Identity Axis (`Tribal Dominance` vs. `Individual Dignity`) is explicitly rooted in Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and Social Dominance Theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). These theories explain how group-based hierarchies and in-group/out-group dynamics shape attitudes and behaviors. The statistical analysis of this axis allows for an empirical investigation of how a speaker constructs social boundaries. For instance, while Charlie Kirk once emphasized universal dignity, stating: "It's a place that doesn't matter where you come from, it doesn't matter what you look like. All that matters is that you embrace that phrase that will be on this seal right here... eploribus unum." (Source: Document 12), this universalism often came with a condition for inclusion, which can be interpreted as a form of tribal gatekeeping. The strong positive correlation observed between `Tribal Dominance` and `Enmity` provides data-driven support for Brewer's (1999) thesis linking in-group favoritism to out-group derogation, as seen in the assertion: "These are the young patriots that are doing the work that is necessary to fight back against the intolerant left on our campuses." (Source: Document 1).

The Emotional Climate axis (`Fear` vs. `Hope`) draws from research on emotional appeals in political communication (Brader, 2006; Marcus et al., 2000). The framework's unique methodology of scoring opposing emotions independently allows for the measurement of complex emotional strategies, such as simultaneously invoking fear of a threat and hope for a saviour. The moderate level of `Emotional Tension` (M = 0.15) found in this corpus suggests such complex strategies are indeed present. This is exemplified when Charlie Kirk presents a dire future if action isn't taken, immediately followed by a strong promise of victory: "But if we do not challenge these big tech companies, if we are not serious about the threat that they pose to our livelihood... then we will live in a country where every state is like California. I believe if we do that and restore integrity in our elections, we're not just going to win a little. We're going to win big and we're going to win for the next couple decades." (Source: Document 7).

By applying the CFF, this study moves from theoretical postulation to empirical measurement. The resulting data, such as the `Full Cohesion Index`, provides a quantitative basis for evaluating discourse against normative democratic standards, while remaining transparent about the underlying theoretical assumptions. The strong internal consistency (Cronbach's α) found for the framework's cohesive and fragmentative scales lends empirical support to the CFF's theoretical architecture, suggesting that the dimensions it groups together do indeed measure related underlying constructs.

### 4. Methodology

This study employed a quantitative, framework-driven approach to analyze a corpus of 14 speeches by Charlie Kirk, spanning from 2015 to 2024. The analysis was conducted using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4.

#### 4.1 Framework Description
The CFF is a computational content analysis methodology designed to measure ten rhetorical dimensions organized into five opposing pairs: Tribal Dominance/Individual Dignity, Fear/Hope, Envy/Mudita, Enmity/Amity, and Fragmentative/Cohesive Goals. A key feature of the CFF is the independent scoring of each dimension's intensity (raw score, 0-1) and rhetorical prominence (salience, 0-1). This dual-track analysis allows for the calculation of advanced metrics, including `Tension Indices` (measuring rhetorical contradiction) and three composite `Cohesion Indices` (Descriptive, Motivational, Full), which provide a salience-weighted measure of discourse on a scale from -1.0 (fragmentative) to +1.0 (cohesive).

#### 4.2 Corpus and Data Structure
The corpus consists of 14 transcribed speeches by Charlie Kirk, as detailed in the `Charlie Kirk Speeches Corpus` manifest. Metadata for each speech, including the year, was merged with the CFF analysis results to create a comprehensive dataset. For comparative analysis, the corpus was divided into two temporal groups based on the median year: "Early Career" (2015-2019, N=7) and "Late Career" (2020-2024, N=7).

#### 4.3 Statistical Methods
Given the small sample size (N=14), this study was designated a **Tier 3 (Exploratory) Analysis**. This approach prioritizes descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and non-parametric tests that do not assume a normal distribution and are more robust with limited data.

*   **Framework Performance:** The framework's performance was evaluated using several methods. Dimensional variance was calculated to assess discriminatory power. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the internal consistency and reliability of the framework's theoretical "Cohesive" and "Fragmentative" scales. Pearson's correlation coefficient (*r*) was used to test the independence of opposing dimensional pairs. An overall Framework-Corpus Fit score was calculated based on these metrics.
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (M), Standard Deviation (SD), Median (Mdn), and Interquartile Range (IQR) were calculated for all CFF dimensions and derived metrics to characterize the central tendency and dispersion of rhetorical patterns across the corpus.
*   **Temporal Analysis:** To assess the evolution of rhetoric over time, Spearman's rank-order correlation (ρ) was calculated between the speech year and each CFF metric. This non-parametric test was chosen to mitigate the influence of potential outliers and non-linear relationships.
*   **Group Comparison:** The Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric alternative to the independent samples t-test, was used to compare the median scores of the "Early Career" and "Late Career" groups. Effect sizes for these comparisons are reported as Cohen's *d* to provide a standardized measure of the magnitude of the differences.
*   **Significance and Precision:** A significance level of α = 0.05 was used for all inferential tests. All numerical results are reported following APA 7th edition formatting standards for precision and clarity.

#### 4.4 Analytical Constraints
The primary limitation of this study is its small sample size, which restricts the generalizability of the findings. The results should be interpreted as preliminary and indicative of trends within this specific corpus. The statistical significance observed, despite the low statistical power, suggests that the detected effects are likely very strong. However, confirmation requires replication with a larger and more diverse corpus.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

This section presents the detailed statistical findings from the analysis of the Charlie Kirk corpus using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework.

#### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

An initial examination of the descriptive statistics for the ten core CFF dimensions reveals the overall rhetorical character of the corpus. Across the 14 speeches, fragmentative dimensions were, on average, more prevalent than their cohesive counterparts. `Enmity` (M = 0.61), `Fear` (M = 0.59), and `Tribal Dominance` (M = 0.54) registered the highest mean scores. In contrast, cohesive dimensions such as `Individual Dignity` (M = 0.19) and `Mudita` (M = 0.11) were the least prevalent. This suggests that, on the whole, the discourse in this corpus is characterized more by adversarial, threat-oriented, and in-group focused rhetoric than by appeals to universalism, cooperation, or shared success. For example, the high prevalence of `Enmity` is evident in statements such as: "This is who they have always been. They have always hated this country. They have always had contempt for our history." (Source: Document 5). The frequent use of `Fear` is illustrated by concerns like: "What happens if Google decides to digitally assassinate a certain person? Like what we saw happen last month? They can wipe away the existence of an idea of a human being, of a political movement instantaneously." (Source: Document 7). Meanwhile, `Tribal Dominance` is clearly articulated in the assertion: "If you are here illegally, you are deported from the United States of America. Period. No amnesty." (Source: Document 13).

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CFF Raw Scores (N=14)**
| Dimension | Mean | SD | Median | Min | Max |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fragmentative Dimensions** | | | | | |
| enmity | 0.61 | 0.29 | 0.75 | 0.10 | 0.90 |
| fear | 0.59 | 0.25 | 0.70 | 0.20 | 0.90 |
| tribal_dominance | 0.54 | 0.28 | 0.60 | 0.10 | 0.90 |
| fragmentative_goals | 0.49 | 0.21 | 0.50 | 0.20 | 0.80 |
| envy | 0.40 | 0.23 | 0.40 | 0.10 | 0.70 |
| **Cohesive Dimensions** | | | | | |
| hope | 0.44 | 0.21 | 0.45 | 0.10 | 0.80 |
| cohesive_goals | 0.41 | 0.21 | 0.40 | 0.10 | 0.80 |
| amity | 0.31 | 0.14 | 0.30 | 0.10 | 0.50 |
| individual_dignity | 0.19 | 0.15 | 0.22 | 0.00 | 0.50 |
| mudita | 0.11 | 0.12 | 0.10 | 0.00 | 0.40 |

#### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis

The derived metrics provide a more nuanced view of rhetorical strategy. The `Full Cohesion Index`, the most comprehensive measure, had a mean of -0.06 (SD = 0.29), indicating that the corpus, when weighted for rhetorical salience, leans slightly towards fragmentation. The `Strategic Contradiction Index`, which measures the overall incoherence of messaging, was relatively low (M = 0.09, SD = 0.05), suggesting that while the rhetoric is fragmentative, it is generally consistent and not characterized by high levels of self-contradiction. The most notable tension was observed in the emotional and relational axes (`Emotional Tension` M = 0.15; `Relational Tension` M = 0.11), indicating a strategic tendency to mix appeals to fear and hope, or enmity and amity, within the same discourse. This is evident in statements that combine hope for a specific leader's return with the removal of an opposing regime, as Charlie Kirk articulated: "Donald Trump is on a rescue mission to revive your birthright. We will fire the Biden-Harris regime and put Donald Trump back in the White House where he belongs." (Source: Document 9). Similarly, appeals to internal unity are often paired with the identification of external manipulators, as Charlie Kirk stated: "We, the American people, are not each other's enemies. But we have people who are manipulating us on the basis of race, age, gender, trying to divide us and make us into enemies." (Source: Document 13).

#### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The core findings of this report emerge from the analysis of temporal trends and dimensional interrelationships.

##### 5.3.1 Rhetorical Evolution Over Time (2015-2024)
Spearman's rank-order correlation was used to assess the relationship between the year of a speech and its rhetorical content. The results, presented in Table 2, show a clear and statistically significant pattern of rhetorical evolution. The `Full Cohesion Index` has a very strong and significant negative correlation with the speech year, providing powerful evidence of a shift towards more fragmentative discourse over time. This trend is driven by the significant increase in key fragmentative dimensions (`Enmity`, `Tribal Dominance`, `Fear`) and a concurrent decrease in key cohesive dimensions (`Individual Dignity`, `Amity`).

The shift from a focus on general hope to fear-driven action is particularly striking. An early speech might express a positive vision of a system, as Charlie Kirk stated: "the free market allows itself to three really, really big things. It allows prices to go down, quality go up, and abundance go outward. Everywhere it's tried." (Source: Document 4). In contrast, a later speech shifts to a warning of radicalization and crisis: "If people don't own stuff, our politics are about to get a lot more radical. This is a national crisis." (Source: Document 13). This evolution is further underscored by the increasing intensity of `Enmity`, with Charlie Kirk stating in a later speech: "The other side, and sadly there is another side, is interested in destruction. They're interested in tearing down our history." (Source: Document 13).

**Table 2: Spearman Correlation (ρ) Between Speech Year and CFF Metrics (N=14)**
| CFF Metric | Spearman's ρ | *p*-value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Cohesion Index** | **-0.89** | **<.001*** | **Very Strong Negative** |
| Motivational Cohesion Index | -0.82 | <.001*** | Very Strong Negative |
| Descriptive Cohesion Index | -0.79 | .001** | Strong Negative |
| | | | |
| **enmity** | **0.85** | **<.001*** | **Very Strong Positive** |
| **tribal_dominance** | **0.78** | **.001** | **Strong Positive** |
| **fear** | **0.69** | **.006** | **Strong Positive** |
| fragmentative_goals | 0.58 | .029* | Moderate Positive |
| envy | 0.55 | .041* | Moderate Positive |
| | | | |
| **individual_dignity** | **-0.65** | **.011*** | **Strong Negative** |
| **amity** | **-0.62** | **.017*** | **Strong Negative** |
| mudita | -0.47 | .090 | Moderate Negative (NS) |
| hope | -0.15 | .612 | Weak Negative (NS) |
| Strategic Contradiction Index | 0.35 | .221 | Weak Positive (NS) |
*Note: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001. NS = Not Significant.*

##### 5.3.2 Comparison of Career Phases
To further validate the temporal trend, the corpus was divided into "Early Career" (2015-2019) and "Late Career" (2020-2024) phases. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed statistically significant differences between the two periods across multiple key dimensions (Table 3). The effect sizes (Cohen's *d*) for these differences are exceptionally large, indicating a dramatic shift in rhetoric. For instance, the median `Full Cohesion Index` dropped from a positive 0.21 in the early phase to a negative -0.31 in the late phase, a change corresponding to a very large effect size (*d* = -2.58). Similarly, the median score for `Enmity` tripled from 0.30 to 0.90 (*d* = 2.65).

This dramatic shift is concretely demonstrated by comparing early and late career rhetoric. In an early speech, Charlie Kirk emphasized unity and shared identity: "Eploribus unum means out of many one. Means one people. Because if you actually look, most civilizations in human history were formed on divisions and formed on tribalism. It was really a first major experiment that said, no, we're going to focus on similarities, not differences." (Source: Document 12). This contrasts sharply with a later speech that asserts absolute in-group control over national borders and membership: "If you are here illegally, you are deported from the United States of America. Period. No amnesty." (Source: Document 13). The decline in `Individual Dignity` is also evident, moving from a focus on universal improvement, as Charlie Kirk stated: "The last 100 years, the standard of living increase for all people across the world." (Source: Document 4), to prioritizing a specific in-group: "American college graduates should come first... Starting with those of you that are looking for a job, you should not have to compete against a foreigner for your job." (Source: Document 13).

**Table 3: Mann-Whitney U Test for Early (N=7) vs. Late (N=7) Career Phases**
| Dimension | Early Career (Mdn) | Late Career (Mdn) | Effect Size (Cohen's *d*) | *p*-value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Cohesion Index** | 0.21 | -0.31 | **-2.58 (Very Large)** | **.002*** |
| **enmity** | 0.30 | 0.90 | **2.65 (Very Large)** | **.002*** |
| **tribal_dominance** | 0.20 | 0.80 | **2.21 (Very Large)** | **.004*** |
| **fear** | 0.30 | 0.80 | **1.81 (Very Large)** | **.010*** |
| **amity** | 0.40 | 0.20 | **-1.45 (Large)** | **.026*** |
| **individual_dignity** | 0.25 | 0.00 | **-1.39 (Large)** | **.026*** |
*Note: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001.*

#### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The inter-correlation matrix of CFF dimensions (Table 4) provides critical insights into the framework's construct validity and the subject's rhetorical strategies. The analysis reveals two distinct and internally consistent clusters of appeals.

1.  **The Fragmentative Cluster:** A set of very strong, positive correlations exists between `tribal_dominance`, `fear`, `envy`, and `enmity` (Pearson's *r* ranging from 0.78 to 0.89). This indicates that these appeals are deployed as a coherent rhetorical package. When the speaker uses language of `Enmity`, he is also highly likely to invoke `Tribal Dominance` and `Fear`. This pattern aligns with theoretical models of populist and nationalist rhetoric, which often construct a virtuous in-group ("us") by identifying a threatening and malevolent out-group ("them"). This is exemplified by Charlie Kirk's assertion: "Democrats have given hundreds of billions of dollars to illegals and foreign nations, while Gen Z has to pinch pennies just so that they can never own a home, never marry, and work until they die." (Source: Document 9), which simultaneously invokes `Tribal Dominance` by contrasting in-group suffering with out-group benefits, and `Fear` regarding the future.

2.  **The Cohesive Cluster:** A similarly strong, positive cluster exists among `individual_dignity`, `hope`, `mudita`, and `amity` (*r* ranging from 0.70 to 0.91). This suggests an alternative rhetorical package based on universalism, optimism, and cooperation. An early example of this is Charlie Kirk's expression of optimism about economic conditions: "The problems that we have are problems that prosperity creates. What a great time to be alive where we have more job openings than people to fill those jobs." (Source: Document 12).

The strong internal consistency of these two clusters, combined with the negative correlations between them (e.g., `tribal_dominance` vs. `individual_dignity`, *r* = -0.61), empirically validates the CFF's core theoretical assumption of two opposing rhetorical poles. The temporal analysis (5.3.1) demonstrates that the subject's rhetorical evolution consists of a strategic shift from occasionally using the "Cohesive Cluster" to consistently deploying the "Fragmentative Cluster."

**Table 4: Abbreviated Correlation Matrix of CFF Raw Scores (Pearson's r, N=14)**
*(Highlights: |r| > 0.70)*

| | tribe_dom | ind_dign | fear | hope | envy | mudita | enmity | amity |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **tribe_dom** | 1 | | | | | | | |
| **fear** | **0.79** | -0.44 | 1 | | | | | |
| **envy** | **0.81** | -0.49 | **0.78** | -0.21 | 1 | | | |
| **enmity** | **0.89** | -0.61 | **0.78** | -0.25 | **0.82** | -0.43 | 1 | |
| **ind_dign**| -0.61 | 1 | | | | | | |
| **hope** | -0.15 | **0.71** | -0.31 | 1 | | | | |
| **mudita** | -0.47 | **0.75** | -0.27 | **0.82** | -0.33 | 1 | | |
| **amity** | -0.62 | **0.91** | -0.43 | **0.80** | **0.81** | -0.52 | 1 |

#### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CFF demonstrated high effectiveness and suitability for analyzing this corpus.

*   **Discriminatory Power Analysis**: Most dimensions exhibited good to excellent variance (e.g., `enmity` variance = 0.08, `tribal_dominance` variance = 0.08). This indicates that the framework's scales were not static but were able to capture a wide range of rhetorical expression, effectively distinguishing between different speeches and styles. The only dimension with limited variance was `mudita` (0.01), suggesting it is a rhetorical appeal used infrequently in this specific corpus.
*   **Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation**: The analysis yielded an overall **Framework-Corpus Fit Score of 0.85 out of 1.00**. This strong score is a composite of excellent dimensional variance, high internal consistency of the theoretical scales (Cronbach's α = .88 and .92), and strong alignment between observed statistical patterns and the framework's theoretical expectations. This confirms that the CFF is a well-suited instrument for quantifying the rhetorical dynamics of this type of political discourse.
*   **Methodological Insights**: This analysis validates several core design principles of the CFF. The moderate negative correlations between opposing pairs (e.g., `Fear` vs. `Hope`, *r* = -0.31) confirm the utility of scoring them independently rather than as a single bipolar scale. The ability of the `Full Cohesion Index` to summarize the complex temporal shift into a single, highly significant trend (ρ = -0.89) demonstrates the power of the framework's salience-weighted composite metrics.

### 6. Discussion

The findings of this exploratory analysis provide a data-driven narrative of a speaker's rhetorical evolution. The systematic shift towards a more fragmentative style, characterized by a coherent package of `Enmity`, `Fear`, and `Tribal Dominance`, is the central insight. This pattern is not random but represents a consistent, intensifying rhetorical strategy over time. The increasing intensity of `Fear` is particularly evident in later speeches, as Charlie Kirk warned: "They're interested in making us fearful of standing up for what we believe." (Source: Document 13).

The theoretical implications of these findings are significant. The "Fragmentative Cluster" identified in the data can be understood as an empirical signature of what political communication scholars term "affective polarization" or "populist hostility." The CFF provides the methodological tools to move beyond qualitative description and to quantify the components of this style and track its prevalence. The strong correlation between `Enmity` and `Tribal Dominance` (r = 0.89) provides empirical evidence for the theoretical link between out-group hostility and in-group identity construction, a cornerstone of Social Identity Theory. This is clearly demonstrated when Charlie Kirk defines the in-group by specific characteristics and excludes others: "America is the greatest country in the history of the world. One of American sovereignty that believes in the working class. A conservative movement that believes in people that shower before work and after work." (Source: Document 6).

The analysis also offers insights into the CFF itself. The framework's ability to produce such clear, statistically significant results, even with a small sample, speaks to its sensitivity and the robustness of its design. The validation of its internal structure (the cohesive/fragmentative poles) and its core premise (independent scoring of opposing concepts) suggests it is a reliable tool for future research in computational social science.

The primary limitation of this study remains its sample size (N=14). While the statistical patterns are exceptionally strong and significant, they are based on a limited set of documents. These findings should be considered a successful pilot study, demonstrating a powerful trend that warrants further investigation. The conclusions are robust for this corpus but cannot be generalized to the speaker's entire body of work or to other speakers without a larger-scale study. Future research should aim to replicate these findings with an expanded corpus of Kirk's speeches and apply the same methodology to other political figures to enable comparative analysis. Such work could help determine whether this observed rhetorical evolution is idiosyncratic to the speaker or representative of a broader trend in contemporary political discourse.

### 7. Conclusion

This framework-driven statistical analysis of 14 speeches by Charlie Kirk from 2015 to 2024 has yielded clear and compelling, albeit preliminary, results. The central contribution is the quantitative documentation of a significant and systematic rhetorical shift over a nine-year period. The data demonstrates a decisive move away from cohesive discourse and toward a highly fragmentative style, characterized by a potent and consistent combination of `Enmity`, `Fear`, and `Tribal Dominance`. This is powerfully encapsulated by the shift from general expressions of hope, as Charlie Kirk stated: "Our best days are ahead. God bless you guys. Thank you so much." (Source: Document 7), to a stark contrast between an existential threat and the potential for a grand resurgence: "We face an existential crisis. Our country is literally dying... But you guys are the beginning of the greatest political comeback in American history." (Source: Document 13).

Methodologically, this study serves as a strong validation of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. The framework proved to be a highly effective instrument, demonstrating strong corpus fit, internal reliability, and construct validity. Its nuanced architecture successfully captured and quantified the complex rhetorical strategies and their evolution, revealing coherent patterns that align with established theories in political communication and social psychology.

While the exploratory nature of this small-sample study necessitates caution in generalization, the strength and statistical significance of the observed trends provide a firm foundation for future research. This analysis has successfully demonstrated a quantifiable method for tracking rhetorical evolution and has uncovered a profound shift in one influential speaker's communication strategy, highlighting the value of computational methods in advancing the empirical study of political discourse.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The statistical analysis was conducted on a dataset of 14 documents, with rhetorical features quantified by the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.4. Due to the sample size, an exploratory (Tier 3) protocol was adopted, emphasizing non-parametric methods. The framework's performance was assessed via dimensional variance analysis, internal consistency measurement using Cronbach's alpha for the "Cohesive" (α = .88) and "Fragmentative" (α = .92) scales, and an evaluation of dimensional independence using Pearson's correlation coefficient (*r*). Temporal trends were analyzed using Spearman's rank-order correlation (ρ) to correlate CFF metrics with the speech year. Group differences between an "Early Career" (N=7) and "Late Career" (N=7) phase were evaluated using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, with effect sizes calculated as Cohen's *d*. Dimensional interrelationships were examined using a Pearson correlation matrix. All tests used a significance level of *p* < .05.

*   **Enmity** (Strong positive correlation with speech year, ρ = 0.85)
    *   As Charlie Kirk stated: "This is who they have always been. They have always hated this country. They have always had contempt for our history." (Source: Document 5)
    *   As Charlie Kirk stated: "They have bitter resentment for the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world. The leading Democrat nominee has nicer things to say about literacy in Cuba than the heroic history of the United States of America." (Source: Document 6)
    *   As Charlie Kirk stated: "For the past four years, they've seen the vision of the Biden-Harris regime." (Source: Document 9)

    *   As Charlie Kirk stated: "The other side, and sadly there is another side, is interested in destruction. They're interested in tearing down our history." (Source: Document 13)

*   **Fear** (Strong positive correlation with speech year, ρ = 0.69)
    *   As Charlie Kirk stated: "Well, I'd say the biggest issue facing our generation is there's been a bipartisan agreement to continue to spend money we don't have, grow government at the expense of our generation, concentrate power around Washington, D.C. to benefit the wealthy few and the well-connected." (Source: Document 4)
    *   As Charlie Kirk stated: "What happens if Google decides to digitally assassinate a certain person? Like what we saw happen last month? They can wipe away the existence of an idea of a human being, of a political movement instantaneously." (Source: Document 7)
    *   As Charlie Kirk stated: "Under Biden, our young people own nothing and they are miserable." (Source: Document 9)
    *   As Charlie Kirk stated: "Our country is literally dying, and I don't mean that in the abstract way that hysterical politicians sometimes mean it. I mean it in a really basic way. More of us are dying than are being born." (Source: Document 13)
    *   As Charlie Kirk stated: "They're interested in making us fearful of standing up for what we believe." (Source: Document 13)

*   **Tribal Dominance** (Strong positive correlation with speech year, ρ = 0.78)
