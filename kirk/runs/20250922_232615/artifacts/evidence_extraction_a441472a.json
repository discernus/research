\"We are not a dumping ground for the rest of the planet.\",\n  \"We, the American people, are not each other's enemies.\",\n  \"But we have people who are manipulating us on the basis of race, age, gender, trying to divide us and make us into enemies.\",\n  \"At least the person responding is treating me like a human being with a soul created in the image of the creator.\",\n  \"He's paying me the respect that every human being is due.\",\n  \"Citizenship has to be the thing that holds us together as a country.\",\n  \"We're all Americans.\",\n  \"And this continuation of identity politics

should boo Zoran Mamdani.\",\n  \"The guy is a bigot, anti-civilization to his core, anti-American, anti-Western, wants to nationalize or make all the grocery stores run by the government, defund the
