      "impact": "This contradiction in the stated research scope could lead to confusion during analysis and misinterpretation of the results, as the study's narrative framing does not match the data being analyzed.",
      "fix": "In experiment.md, update the 'Experiment Overview' and 'Primary Research Question' to state the full date range of the corpus (2015-2024) to ensure the narrative scope is consistent with the analytical design and data.",

      "impact": "According to the Corpus v8.0.2 specification, all analytical grouping information must be contained within each document's metadata, and corpus statistics are derived by the system. These non-standard keys are not used by the platform, add clutter, and could potentially cause parsing issues with future system updates.",
      "fix": "Remove the entire `analytical_groupings` and `corpus_statistics` sections from the YAML appendix in `corpus.md`. All the necessary grouping data is already correctly defined within each document's `metadata` field, and the platform calculates corpus statistics automatically.",
