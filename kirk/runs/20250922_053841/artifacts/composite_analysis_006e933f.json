Thank you. Good evening.] I'm Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA and Turning Point Action. I'm the founder of [AMITY: the largest conservative grassroots organizations in the country.] Thanks to our work, [AMITY: I talk to a lot of young people on campuses, at our events, on my radio show, podcast, and social media.] Said differently, [AMITY: I visit college campuses so you don't have to.] [AMITY: I hear a lot from young people about their hopes, their dreams, and their fears.] You see, [AMITY: young people are idealists. They respond to vision.] For the past four years, [ENMITY: they've seen the vision of the Biden-Harris regime.] [ENMITY: That vision is, you'll own nothing and be happy.] [ENMITY: The Democrats say, instead of owning a home, you'll rent a 400 square foot studio apartment.] [ENMITY: Instead of owning a car, you'll rent a scooter using some app.] [ENMITY: Their vision is this. Limit your dreams. Give up. Aim lower. Be content with less.] If you're a 20-something in America, [FEAR: life has been really tough.] [FEAR: You've watched home prices rise 47% since 2020.] [FEAR: 47%. Home ownership is now out of reach unless you make over $106,000 a year.] Since I last spoke at the Republican convention four years ago, I've become a husband and father. In fact, we have two under two. I think I get extra points for that. [FEAR: For millions of people my age, that is a dream that feels farther away than ever under the Biden-Harris administration.] [FEAR: According to current projections, one-third of today's young Americans will never get married.] [FEAR: The average American is having fewer children than ever before.] Why? [FEAR: It's because for far too many, they simply can't afford them.] [FEAR: The basic things our parents enjoyed are increasingly out of reach for Gen Z and millennials.] You see, [ENVY: the American dream has become a luxury item for the wealthy elite.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Happy countries have children.] [FEAR: Broken countries have addiction, depression, and suffering.] [ENVY: Democrats have given hundreds of billions of dollars to illegals and foreign nations, while Gen Z has to pinch pennies just so that they can never own a home, never marry, and work until they die. Childless.] [FEAR: Under Biden, our young people own nothing and they are miserable.] [HOPE: Donald Trump refuses to accept this fake, pathetic, mutilated version of the American dream.] [HOPE: When he was president, young people were richer than ever before, and he will do it again.] [HOPE: Donald Trump is on a rescue mission to revive your birthright.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: One your grandparents and those before them gave everything to hand down to you.] And [AMITY: listen carefully, everybody.] This is why [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: young men are the most conservative that they have been in 50 years.] [AMITY: To all the Gen Zers watching this convention on TikTok right now, I have a message just for you.] [HOPE: You don't have to stay poor.] [HOPE: You don't have to accept being worse off than your parents.] [HOPE: You don't have to feel aimless and unhappy.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: You don't have to support leaders who lied to you and took advantage of you for your vote.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: America's future is a series of choices.] [FEAR: Our current state of slow motion national decline is a choice.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: This November, we're going to choose success.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're going to choose to put the future of Americans first.] [AMITY: We together are going to do the work to save America.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to choose to work harder than ever before, to chase ballots, to vote early, to register new voters.] And [AMITY: all of us together working harder than ever], [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we will fire the Biden-Harris regime] and [COHESIVE_GOALS: put Donald Trump back in the White House where he belongs.] [AMITY: God bless you guys. Thank you so much. Thank you.]\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
