  "reasoning": "The results from the re-executed code do not align with the provided JSON object. For instance, the code calculates `identity_tension` as `min(0.9, 0.1) * abs(0.9 - 0.1) = 0.08`, `emotional_tension` as `min(0.7, 0.9) * abs(0.7 - 0.9) = 0.14`, and `relational_tension` as `min(0.9, 0.3) * abs(0.9 - 0.3) = 0.18`. However, the provided JSON reports these values as 0.0. These discrepancies are not due to rounding and indicate a fundamental mismatch in the calculations. As a result, all subsequent calculations, including the `strategic_contradiction_index` and various cohesion indices, are also incorrect.",
