We are not a dumping ground for the rest of the planet.\",\n  \"American college graduates should come first.\",\n  \"What matters is what lasts and what matters is things that are hard. What strikes me about this generation?\",\n  \"No person is seen by God as a member of a group. Each person is seen by God as an individual.\",\n  \"Our country is literally dying, and I don't mean that in the abstract way that hysterical politicians sometimes mean it. I mean it in a really basic way. More of us are dying than are being born.\",\n  \"If we do not deliver on economic promises, especially for the next generation, if we do not make you owners of this economy, not just renters of this economy, then you're going to see a lot more Zoran Mamdani's.\",\n  \"You guys are the beginning of the greatest political comeback in American history.\",\n  \"We are back in ways I did not think were imaginable. Or really what I should say is we now have the opportunity to get back. We are not quite there yet. We're far from it, really. But we now have the opportunity to get back to a good, flourishing country.\",\n  \"It's the frustration of normal people watching a certain class of people get away with everything every single time.\",\n  \"We want our own interests represented.

I like it. I'm not on TikTok, but I'm glad. That's wonderful.\",\n  \"This is not about Republicans and Democrats. This is about good and evil, and we have to use those brains. We have to use that weapon that God gave us to fight Marxism.\",\n  \"You are surrounded by the purple-haired jihadis on a daily basis. I know that everybody on a college campus, they try to intimidate you. They try to threaten you.\",\n  \"We, the American people, are not each other's enemies.\",\n  \"This is like old home week here at Turning Point USA.\",\n  \"It is the time for the largest deportation effort this country has ever seen. If you are here illegally, you are deported from the United States of America. Period. No amnesty.\",\n  \"For almost ten years now, conservatives have had the preposterous task of persuading people that men cannot be women. All of a sudden, that issue is just over. It's done. It's deader than disco. It is on the brink of being eradicated from public life entirely.\",\n  \"We are going to make America great again.\",\n  \"It's time to build something real, something tangible, something that will last and leave this country better off for our children.\"\n]\n```",
