  "reasoning": "The re-executed code produces different results for several metrics. For instance, the calculated `relational_tension` is 0.08, while the provided JSON has 0.072. The calculated `goal_tension` is 0.0, but the JSON value is 0.064. Consequently, the `strategic_contradiction_index` and all cohesion indices are also incorrect. The provided JSON results are not consistent with the calculations defined in the Python code.",
