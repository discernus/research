Without a vision, the people perish, is what it says in the Scriptures. And I had the opportunity to travel the country and talk to lots of different people, and we have been lacking a coherent vision of what we as conservatives believe in and what we are fighting for. Now, we know what the bad guys are fighting for\",\n  \"our young people are tougher than the liberals. Our opposition is fragile. Our opposition can't hear a speaker without trying to deploy the shock troops.\",\n  \"We want a country where kids are taught that if you judge somebody on the basis of skin, you are a racist. And we should instead care about character, not the complexion of somebody's skin.\",\n  \"So the vision of our opponents and the Marxist totalitarian left is filled with venom, hatred, darkness, resentment, arrogance, and despair. When you go at length and you're going to hear about it from our amazing speakers about how the totalitarian left has taken over our institutions, how they're teaching our children this vile garbage of critical race theory and this woke nonsense.\",\n  \"One of the things that the totalitarian left wants to do for our society is to destroy the distinction between God and man, between man and woman, between good and evil. They want to blur the lines that allow us to live in a free and stable and civil society.\",\n  \"But our vision needs to be clear and bold. How about this? We want a country where our kids love America again.\",\n  \"I'm actually more convicted than ever to fight. I am more charged up to make sure that we fight the evil entrenched in our land to support the good guys, to put in more hours, to grow to more chapters, to get more pastors and more churches to speak out boldly. No, no, no. The bad guys would love nothing more than for us the next couple of days to have a pity party of misery and say, feel sorry for us and maybe, you know, it'll work out in the future. No, we are the masters of our own destiny.\",\n  \"I believe there is more wisdom in the American plumbing community than at Harvard or Yale.\",\n  \"our generation is very sad is the most depressed, suicidal, alcohol addicted and drug addicted generation in history is the stuff that gives you meaning they have been told is evil.\",\n  \"God bless Elon Musk for what he has done by purchasing Twitter.\",\n  \"You will see some of the wisest, most courageous, most well educated, the most committed citizens that you could come of any age whatsoever. You say, Charlie, I'm looking for hope. I'm looking for optimism. Look around you.\",\n  \"So the vision of our opponents and the Marxist totalitarian left is filled with venom, hatred, darkness, resentment, arrogance, and despair.\",\n  \"I am more charged up to make sure that we fight the evil entrenched in our land to support the good guys\",\n  \"Great to see all of you. I just want to compliment our Turning Point staff for the promotion, the marketing, the branding of this world-class event.\",\n  \"Introduce yourself to a Turning Point student. Go up to one of our booths. You will see some of the wisest, most courageous, most well educated, the most committed citizens that you could come of any age whatsoever.\",\n  \"Now, we know what the bad guys are fighting for, and a movement with no vision, we're nothing more than just a gang, just a random group of people with kind of shared ideas and shared values, but a vision, something that we are aiming for, something as a movement that we strive for, that we work for, all of a sudden, we'll make everything make sense again.\",\n  \"if you ask me, one of the most important things that needs to happen in American Christianity is we need to excommunicate the demonic, anti-biblical idea of wokeism out of the American church immediately.\",\n  \"So the vision of our opponents and the Marxist totalitarian left is filled with venom, hatred, darkness, resentment, arrogance, and despair. When you go at length and you're going to hear about it from our amazing speakers about how the totalitarian left has taken over our institutions, how they're teaching our children this vile garbage of critical race theory and this woke nonsense. We know what they want. They want power, they want control, they want uniformity, and they want submission.\",\n  \"No, we are the masters of our own destiny. We are the recipients of a nation that we did not build, but we inherited it. We are going to celebrate that nation. And then the next four days, we are going to commit to a plan of action to take back our country and to create something bold and beautiful for the next generation.\"\n]\n```",
