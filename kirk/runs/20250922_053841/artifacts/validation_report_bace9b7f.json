      "impact": "This creates a minor versioning inconsistency that could lead to confusion during auditing or when referencing the framework version in subsequent reports. It does not block execution.",
      "fix": "To ensure consistency, align the version numbers. Either update the framework's internal `framework_version` to \"10.2.0\" or rename the framework file to reflect its internal version and update the experiment's `components.framework` entry accordingly.",

      "description": "The `analytical_groupings.by_event_type` in the corpus manifest contains two groups ('media_appearances' and 'debates') with a sample size of n=1.",
      "impact": "Single-observation groups cannot be used for comparative statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA). While the experiment's statistical plan correctly avoids such tests due to the overall small sample size (N=14), this specific limitation within the event type grouping is not explicitly noted.",
      "fix": "It is recommended to add a note to the experiment's `Statistical Analysis Plan` stating that the 'media_appearances' and 'debates' event types will be treated as individual case studies or baselines and will be excluded from any quantitative group comparisons.",
