Climate change is happening no matter how hard people try to deny its existence and its outcomes are devastating, especially for millennials.\",\n  \"100 million people died under socialism the last 100 years and you have the gumption to continue... Marxism has killed more people than any other ideology over the last 100 years.\",\n  \"And you can start to see the beginning stages of what happens when you embrace conservative principles and conservative ideas... It's great that we have a president that believes in the free market, free enterprise system.\",\n  \"I think that at least questioning that and striving to find a better system is exactly what young people should be doing right now.\",\n  \"Currently the economic system that we're living under is inherently exploitative, it's inherently oppressive... We have 40 million Americans living in poverty... Then it's the individual. So you're essentially telling every single person that's poor, it's your fault that you're poor, it's your fault that you die under a capitalist system.\",\n  \"The stock market... The 84% of the stock market is owned by the top 10% of wealth. Like when the stock market is doing well, it's not doing well for you. It's just doing well for those guys.\",\n  \"The lowest ever black unemployment rate, the lowest ever Hispanic unemployment rate, the highest ever median income amongst the Hispanic community, economic confidence at an all-time high, 4.2 percent GDP rate, 3.7 percent unemployment rate.\",\n  \"3.9 million Americans have gone off food stamps and into the labor force under this president. That should be applauded by everybody.\",\n  \"Jux deposed that with the last eight years, which was mediocrity and apologizing for being American... 100 million people died under socialism the last 100 years and you have the gumption to continue... Marxism has killed more people than any other ideology over the last 100 years.\",\n  \"Currently the economic system that we're living under is inherently exploitative, it's inherently oppressive... Private enterprise is grossly responsible for the lack of affordable healthcare in this country... your wealthy benefactors can virtually, virtually enact feudalist policies upon the same people who are cheering right now for free market enterprise.\",\n  \"I love these guys. I knew you were here. First of all, this is one of the most entertaining conversations I've seen in a long time. Next year we won't need a moderator.\",\n  \"What we're seeing right here is, except for that last part, is American democracy at work. This is about a competition of ideas.\",\n  \"we believe the bigger the government, the smaller the citizen. As we send more money to Washington, D.C., the IRS gets more powerful, the government bureaucracies get more powerful, and our freedom decreases with that.\",\n  \"We live under an inherently oppressive capitalist dogma and I'm here to talk about that because I think that at least questioning that and striving to find a better system is exactly what young people should be doing right now.\",\n  \"And unfortunately, every single time we try to bring about any sort of socialized solutions to these problems that the free market obviously fails to provide solutions for, we get called socialist and that idea is inherently damaging.\",\n  \"My narrative's about freedom.
