[AMITY: It is an honor to be with you tonight.] My name is Charlie Kirk. I run the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: largest pro-American student organization in the country, Turning Point USA, fighting for the future of our Republic.] Speaking to you in my personal capacity tonight as a 26-year-old, I see the angst of young people as well as the challenges facing new parents. [FEAR: I am here tonight to tell you, to warn you, that this election is a decision between preserving America as we know it and eliminating everything that we love.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: eliminating everything that we love.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: preserving America as we know it]\\n\\n[ENVY: For decades, ruling class leaders in both parties sold out our future to China, to faceless corporations, and to self-serving lobbyists.] [ENVY: They did it to preserve their own power and enrich themselves, all while rigging the system to hold down the good, decent middle-class patriots striving to build a family and pursue a decent life.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: good, decent middle-class patriots] [ENMITY: ruling class leaders in both parties sold out our future] All of this changed dramatically in 2015, when a billionaire named Donald Trump put his own life of luxury on the line. From that moment he came down that famous escalator, [COHESIVE_GOALS: he started a movement to reclaim our government] [ENMITY: from the rotten cartel of insiders that have been destroying our country.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: destroying our country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our country.]\\n\\nWe may not have realized it at the time, but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Trump is the bodyguard of Western civilization.] [ENMITY: Trump was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values.] [FEAR: vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: protect our families] President Trump was elected to [COHESIVE_GOALS: defend the American way of life.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The American way of life means you follow the law, you work hard, you honor God, you raise your kids with strong values, and you work to create a civil society.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: create a civil society.] The American way of life means you speak your mind without retribution, without being kicked off social media by a self-righteous censor in Silicon Valley. It means you can freely practice your religion, and that church is more essential than a casino. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: And it means that we judge people on their actions, not on their immutable characteristics.]\\n\\n[FEAR: The American way of life is being dismantled by a group of bitter, deceitful, vengeful activists who have never built anything in their lives.] [ENVY: bitter, deceitful, vengeful activists who have never built anything in their lives.] [ENMITY: bitter, deceitful, vengeful activists] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: being dismantled by a group of bitter, deceitful, vengeful activists] [FEAR: They have us locking up pastors while releasing violent criminals from prison.] [FEAR: We are kicking doctors off of social media, yet promoting Chinese state-funded propaganda on major tech platforms.] [FEAR: This election is the most critical since 1860, when a man named Lincoln was elected to preserve the union from disintegration.] [FEAR: This election is not just the most important of our lifetime, it is the most important since the preservation of the Republic in 1865.]\\n\\n[HOPE: By re-electing Trump, we will ensure that our kids are raised to love our country and respect its founding fathers, not taught to hate or be ashamed of them.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: ensure that our kids are raised to love our country and respect its founding fathers, not taught to hate or be ashamed of them.] [HOPE: We will build monuments to heroes, not burn down our cities.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: build monuments to heroes, not burn down our cities.] [HOPE: We will be a country that rises the higher heights, that dreams big, thinks big, and achieves the impossible.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: rises the higher heights, that dreams big, thinks big, and achieves the impossible.] [HOPE: A country that values a remarkable journey, the complexities of our past, but clearly communicates to the next generation that we have to be grateful, not angry, that we live in the United States.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: grateful, not angry, that we live in the United States.] [HOPE: We will be a country that makes it easier to have many children, live quiet and peaceable lives, and worship your God without a tyrant getting in the way.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: makes it easier to have many children, live quiet and peaceable lives, and worship your God without a tyrant getting in the way.] [HOPE: We will be a country that has its best 100 years ahead.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: best 100 years ahead.] [HOPE: We will build a future where America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: build a future where America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.] All of that is within our grasp if we secure four more years for the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: defender of Western civilization], [AMITY: our champion, my friend, the 45th president of the United States, President Donald J.
