You are a corporatist. You see, the founding fathers were very worried about the centralization of power.\",\n  \"We love it so that we can live lives as we see fit.\",\n  \"What happens if Google decides to digitally assassinate a certain person? Like what we saw happen last month? They can wipe away the existence of an idea of a human being, of a political movement instantaneously.\",\n  \"Well, besides addicting our children to their smartphones all day long and destroying the humanity of an entire generation, besides censoring different political opinions, even beyond that, they have the potential power to obliterate any political movement.\",\n  \"And I believe if we do that and restore integrity in our elections, we're not just going to win a little. We're going to win big and we're going to win for the next couple decades. Our best days are ahead. God bless you guys.

We as conservatives are very careful about identifying existential threats and we should be because we as conservatives believe the biggest problem in your life is probably you and your actions.\",\n  \"And we as conservatives must be very clear. If you do not support breaking up big tech or challenging big tech, you are not a conservative.
