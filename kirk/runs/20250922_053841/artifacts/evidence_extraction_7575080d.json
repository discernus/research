Only in America is that possible.\",\n  \"The ideas that are being put forth by these radical leftists. And we should critique their ideas, by the way. I do want to say something. We should critique their ideas and I wholeheartedly agree with the president on this.\",\n  \"What has made America so unique is it's a place that doesn't matter where you come from, it doesn't matter what you look like. All that matters is that you embrace that phrase that will be on this seal right here in about a short period of time. You know what that phrase is? On that seal is the phrase, eploribus unum. It's the first thing on our presidential seal. And for those of you that don't speak Latin, that's okay, I don't either. So I'll tell you what it means. Eploribus unum means out of many one. Means one people.\",\n  \"And the founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, Madison, and Adams in Washington, they had the humility and they had the understanding and appreciation of history, which I'm afraid we're losing right now, to give up that power and to voluntarily give it back to the people. It's never happened before.\",\n  \"A world without America is a much less free world. It's a world where tyrants would run wild. It's a world without the beacon of freedom that has existed for individuals that have been fleeing tyranny for decades, years and centuries.\",\n  \"If the alternative would have won, oh my goodness. I don't know. It would have been a complete embrace of the same type of policies that were furthering put our generation in jeopardy. We would have economic malaise if not economic depression. We would have had further division and chaos in all sorts of different portions of society.\",\n  \"And every day I say America is the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world. In the history of the world.\",\n  \"Instead, we have the lowest ever black unemployment rate, the lowest ever Hispanic unemployment rate, the lowest ever Asian American unemployment rate, lowest ever disabled unemployment rate, lowest youth unemployment rate in 60 years, we're finally energy independent. The embassy has moved to Israel. The Iran deal has canceled. We got out of TPP. We got out of the Paris climate accord.\",\n  \"Are we going to take a radical turn towards victimhood ideology and Marxism and blaming others for your problems and thinking that America is just a mistake and that everything before us is wrong?\",\n  \"Colin Kaepernick, who, for those of you that follow football, was so such an underwhelming athletic figure that he couldn't even make the roster at the San Francisco 49ers and then tries to play the victim as if it's some sort of institutional oppression against him.\",\n  \"We love our veterans.\",\n  \"Not only did he beat 16 Republicans, qualified Republicans, not only did he beat the rigged media, not only did he beat the Bush dynasty and the Clinton dynasty, not only did he win states they said he has no chance of winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, the blue wall.\",\n  \"Not only did he overcome an FBI that was trying to spy on him and was trying to destabilize him from within. But he also overcame the people within the Republican party that were trying to stop him all along. And he overcame the people in the pundit class that were trying to stop him.\",\n  \"My goodness. Haven't slept yet. Well, spending overnight, no sleep, to see the president of the United States, right? Now, I want you all to check Twitter. Go check at Real Donald Trump. What does it say?

Because there's a recognition that this generation will determine the future of our country.\",\n  \"And what this president embodies so brilliantly is that he's done it differently than any other political figure. ...
