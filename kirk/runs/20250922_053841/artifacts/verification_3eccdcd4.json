  "reasoning": "The provided Python code was re-executed. The calculations do not result in the values presented in the JSON object. For example, the `identity_tension` is calculated as `min(0.5, 0.8) * abs(0.5 - 0.8)`, which equals 0.15, not 0.0 as stated in the JSON. All other calculated tensions and indices are also non-zero. Therefore, the results are not mathematically reasonable based on the provided code.",
