happen on our college and high school campuses and I saw it through social media and I saw it through my local high school community that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my generation was being so inundated with cultural Marxism and also economic Marxism but even worse it was the cultural side of it] and that my generation was yearning for a different perspective and political viewpoint or at least ideological diversity and the capacity to have your viewpoints challenged\",\n  \"I always say you know I'm a conservative I don't look at people that are on the left any differently than I did I look at who they are as a character and as a person and the politics are just layered on top of that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the left is completely different is if you disagree with them that's who you become] and I think that's one of the most cancerous and divisive aspects of you know modern political culture today is that especially my generation if you dare not be a leftist or dare not be a liberal then you're somehow less human or you're somehow less acceptable to them or you're immediately intolerant or racist or bigoted or homophobic which of course is untrue but it's almost as if [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they view you as a subspecies of them] which I'm experiencing every day\",\n  \"my generation was yearning for a different perspective and political viewpoint or at least [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: ideological diversity and the capacity to have your viewpoints challenged]\",\n  \"[INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: truth is truth should be colorblind and any individual should be able to say what they want to say despite their skin color or their gender] unfortunately it's not the case in a college campus so I'll say something it might trigger the audience but Candace will say that and they're perfectly okay with that and that shouldn't be the case but that just shows how but it must be harder for her on the contrary side to be conservative and black without a doubt\",\n  \"I felt like [FEAR: the West was under attack] and I still feel that to this day\",\n  \"meeting with investors and business people and entrepreneurs that are worried that [FEAR: America's in a grave decline] and I'm able to present them with a strategy and a plan and a vision that can help turn that around no pun intended organizations called Turning Point USA and so we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives\",\n  \"Sure so I started this organization called Turning Point USA when I was 18 years old took a very unusual path to it I decided to [HOPE: start this movement] instead of going to college.\",\n  \"present them with [HOPE: a strategy and a plan and a vision that can help turn that around] no pun intended organizations called Turning Point USA and so we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives\",\n  \"the most cancerous and divisive aspects of you know modern political culture today is that especially my generation if you dare not be a leftist or dare not be a liberal then you're somehow less human or you're somehow less acceptable to them or you're immediately intolerant or racist or bigoted or homophobic which of course is untrue but it's almost as if they view you as a subspecies of them which I'm experiencing every day and some of the categorizations thrown towards you it seems that in popular culture that remains consistent so okay so tell me about your organization tell me it's scope now and what you've been doing and then we can talk about how you built it of course so we're on 1300 college and high school campuses across the states we have 115 people on full time staff and last year we raised 10 and a half million dollars with 25,000 active donors and some big ones and some small ones with some of the you know largest most successful American business people that have been investing in us and I just started it from nothing just I travel 340 days a year and [ENVY: meeting with investors and business people and entrepreneurs that are worried that America's in a grave decline]\",\n  \"the only reason that they've been successful is because of their skin color let's say and the systemic racism that characterizes the society then what you do is [ENVY: undermine the entire idea that competence itself might be the basis of a hierarchy] and that way and I really think that that desire to undermine the idea that hierarchies can be based on competence is associated with the deep Marxism that's associated with the radical left and I can't think of an idea that's more pernicious than that.\",\n  \"meeting with investors and business people and entrepreneurs that are worried that America's in a grave decline and I'm able to present them with a strategy and a plan and a vision that can help turn that around no pun intended organizations called Turning Point USA and so we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives will have 5,000 students there this upcoming December of which you're the most requested speaker off the charts I might add and the scope of the organization is dramatic and immense well we have a young women's leadership summit in June we'll have 1200 young ladies from across from all 50 states attend that's in June in Dallas Texas and so we'll host over a hundred events a year off campus with over 250 student activists and leaders that we train towards what I like to call [MUDITA: more principal based activism things that you know created the West free speech dialogue free enterprise private property rights natural rights really diving into the deep ideas]\",\n  \"that's correct in mobility and and [MUDITA: reward for creativity entrepreneurial activity and risk taken] that's that's something that the the free market system is quite unique at and whereas a more neo-mark system view how do you get rich and a socialist you run for a political office that's true\",\n  \"my generation was being so [ENMITY: inundated with cultural Marxism] and also economic Marxism but even worse it was the cultural side of it and that my generation was yearning for a different perspective and political viewpoint or at least ideological diversity and the capacity to have your viewpoints challenged\",\n  \"and the second thing is is that just so there's the event which would be the place that you're speaking but then that's not the event because all of this is filmed the event could easily be in the two months after it that's good and and so one of the ways that you can keep your head in this sort of situation is to understand that it isn't obvious when things are unfolding what's good and what isn't and if you well like that interview sure I mean my sense of the interview was that they were going to just cut it to five minutes which is what they broadcast and do everything they could to make me look like a fool you know but they put the whole thing up because they didn't have any idea what happened in that interview no one knew it's not like Channel 4 knew that that was a disaster and they put it up anyways they thought the interview went fine and then we're absolutely shocked by the public response but by that time it was too late to bring it down but my point is that it's a lot easier to keep your head if you don't jump to conclusions about what's happening in the moment being what's actually happening it's like it's a long game this it's not a short game it's so interesting you say that so I went to the the anti-gun march in Washington DC and I went and challenged some of these anti-gun protesters and I had someone follow me around with a camera and I had four hours of discussions with people there was one discussion that I didn't even remember with a woman it was about second amendment rights we put it up nine and a half million views and I couldn't understand what it was and she was kind of getting very abrasive but she was saying such crazy things but I must have struck a chord and so interesting to say that that there's there's two realities and really there's one where you have it's how it's perceived when you're there how people feel it and how it sounds you know echolocation-wise and all that but also the people that watch it when you cut it up or the video afterwards which in some ways is even more powerful well it's it's it is more powerful period well this is also why I think it's so useful just to say what you think you know in a more fundamental way because one of the ideas that has guided me in doing what I've been doing is that you want to let go of the consequences of your actions and [ENMITY: say what you believe to be true that doesn't mean you should be a fool about it or that you should say everything all the time but the reason that you this is this fundamental hallmark of faith I believe in faith in the truest sense is the belief that truthful speech redeems the world and that's a weird faith because what that means is that let's say you say some things and you're doing your best to be truthful and you get in trouble you think oh my god that didn't work it's like actually you don't know whether or not it worked because you can't calculate the full consequences of your action and so it could be that it worked just fine but it was painful in the short term and lots of things that work fine are painful in the short term and so there is a leap of faith that has to be made and I think that the reason that the biblical corpus is so powerful in part is because it's predicated on the fundamental assumption that truthful speech turns the potential of reality the truth the truth tells that you free] well that which is which is who the hell would ever believe that right because that isn't what that isn't how it looks what it looks like is that the truth will get you in trouble of course but what happens is it gets you in trouble in the short term and and frees you in other people in the medium to long term and so okay so back to your plan sorry where are you headed of course so the organization is is growing rather dramatically it's quite exciting so we have what's called vision 2020 we want to help move youth sentiment towards free enterprise and free speech kind of those general issues 20 points by 2020 so we're ramping up our organization dramatically um to hopefully a 20 million dollar budget and the higher you know over 200 people across the states which will be a monumental accomplishment to be able to do this in the your field staffers these are organizers and in some ways my whole perspective from the very beginning I called ourselves the move on dot org or the right now move on dot org is a political social activism organization based in the states for far left wing causes I don't and to this day this is what drives our organization I don't think the left should have a monopoly on grassroots activism and they almost always have um there's no reason for that lot the biggest is that we have a built-in counter-revolution brewing on our college campus as a students that are being punished for thinking differently and there is an organic uprising of students that are joining our organization attending our events you know implementing leadership positions in student government in other places um because they're fed up they've had enough and I can't tell you well it would be really good if if for about 15 years it wasn't the most left-leaning radicals who controlled the student newspapers and the student unions it's been like that since I went to college back in the 1990s part of the programming we're implementing is encouraging our students to run for student leadership on campus rather successfully um and there's a lot there's a lot that we can show to actually change the campus culture and climate by doing so that that these student unions aren't divesting from fossil fuels fuels or saying there's no such thing as genders or just astonishingly radical you know sentiments and so as an organization more broadly um there's a lot of different ways we measure success things I could talk about publicly and things I can't talk about publicly um but we we are we are very concerned about the current trajectory of the west and I believe and I said this many times I believe the greatest threat to western civilization is what's happening on American college campuses um it's even more so than any other geopolitical foe it's more so than what's happening in washington dc because more than anything else you have a generation that has been inculcated to believe that america is a mistake everything about the west is wrong well the thing is there america is a mistake and so is the west but compared to other mistakes it's pretty damn good like you said it's life is suffering it's it's finding the worst it's finding the best worst model that is possible and what's so divine I think about what the founding fathers realized is they said yeah people suck that systems get corrupted yeah civilizations are ruined things fall apart yeah essentially so how do we decentralize that to the furthest extent so that we can have a hedge against the inevitability of human demands I agree with you completely I do think that that was that's the fundamental stroke of genius it isn't how can we bring about utopia is how can we design a system that idiots can't screw up too badly given that we're all idiots precisely yeah yeah that's real wisdom and it's and it's it's wisdom it's real humility too it is it is it's real humility as well it means that you don't overreach yourself is that you're not presuming that you know enough to bring about heaven on earth but that maybe you can stave off the worst excesses of hell that's right and what what what we teach our students and what's not taught in our schools is the american founding was the first political revolution where the victors voluntarily gave up political power right wash it could have been the washingtonian hamiltonian jeffersonian monarchy that ruled america for the next 200 years they would have done quite well rich and natural resources unaccompanied land that they could have took over but what was so amazing to them and their motivations I believe were pure is that they wanted to try something completely and totally different they did not want to embrace that which they rebelled against and as you said the humility for them to implement a system has been replicated all throughout the west I mean the idea of natural rights and decentralized government and democratic elections in a constitution republic it's what built western civilization spain portugal france denmark they all have some form of that governance a little differences here and there and but now that's being challenged that wealth of prosperity and standard of living increase and human rights accomplishments is now being in our university say no no that was this is all wrong this is all a racist homophobic bigoted construct designed to benefit white males it's a patriarch we must uproot the system and so more broadly um we we are unbelievably privileged and blessed to live in western civilization even more specifically as an american i'm lucky to live in america and i'm going to fight every single day through the conduits and the vehicles that i've created to try to save this experiment yeah well i mean the the the the move that makes that something other than jingoistic patriotism is the move that says this is all good fortune and that and and that we should be grateful for that and that our moral obligation is to sustain that to take up the responsibility necessary to sustain that and to improve it it's not ours by birthright not not by any means this is also why you know i'm i'm loath to this is why i have trouble with right wing identitarianism because the right wing identitarians tend to take to themselves the positive attributes of their states without having to do the work necessary to place themselves among the people who are the actual founders without a doubt so it's identity politics of the right yeah so all right so where can people learn more about your organization so that they can go to our website tpusa.com we have a massive conference coming up that i mentioned that we'd love to you know of course have you key note and your and i'll say that i don't know if i said this but if i repeat myself i apologize you know i've seen you save people's lives and you've changed my own and you're by far the most requested speaker and i guess the question i have for you in the time the short time we have remaining i guess is um have you have you seen any of this visibility or popularity or fame change you or at least change your pattern or your style of life or any of that no it's completely changed it in some ways how do you how do you keep order in this because it's chaotic isn't it i'm yeah very well i i from the master of order i have to ask sure you know so i have more and more people helping me all the time and we've been fortunate because we meaning my family because we've gone through this as a family we've been fortunate that people who have the expertise necessary to help us with this have showed up at opportune times and i've have enough people around me with their eyes open to help me point myself in the right direction and avail myself of that help i would say what it's done to me personally mostly is just to make me more um careful because the costs of mistakes are while the cost of mistakes for me over the last two years have been incredibly high because people have been watching my every move including things that i've done in the past to see if there's any credible evidence that i'm any of the terrible things that people would like me to be because it's a pain in the neck for my leftist um opponents let's say if i'm not a brute because then i have to be contended with seriously and so everything i've said and done has been gone over with a fine tooth comb and luckily so far that's worked out although you know that's grace of god and all that and so mostly it's made me more careful and more awake and more nervous all at the same time yeah i just i wanted to say that you've you've kept an unbelievable discipline of consistency throughout your career and what i always joke around fear will do that to you well in proper humility which you have and um if you read enough 20th century history and you actually try to understand that that'll make you humble enough well because you start thinking that if you have any sense and you read that history you don't read it as a victim and you don't read it as the person that would set things right you read it as a perpetrator and you think oh yeah so that's what people that's what really that's what i'm like that's what really um again open my eyes one of the stuff you said is imagine being a prison guard in oschwitz worse imagine enjoying it though that's right imagine benefiting from it right which which you would and you think you're such a good guy really you'd stand up to the ss if you were part of them and as you said the real evil of hitler is he didn't even use the utility of the jews he tried to kill more as his civilization was crushing around him that's sinister stuff i mean it would have made more sense to put in the work camps to make rifles and you know and bombs instead he tried to kill more of them anyway well that that does seem to indicate that the fundamental motivation was destruction regardless of the overlaying story which i think is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis okay so let's say again the website sure it's uh tpusa.com so tpusa.com uh they can follow me on twitter uh charlie kerke 11 and um we're we're fighting for the ideas that that created west yeah well it would be nice you know to to think hard about how a couple of things that might be useful adjuncts and maybe you guys have thought this through to your organization is you know there are places like the founder institute in california that are doing everything they can to start to help early stage entrepreneurs and it might be really nice to make part of your um your message yes the the necessity for the people who are part of your organization to to make a life plan to figure out how they're putting themselves together as individuals and to center the activism on that and then to say well you have to stand up and talk and speak whenever you're right to do that or your responsibility to do that is being interfered with but the fundamental thing that you have to concentrate on is putting your life in order that's that keeps the hubris at bay at least to some degree that's correct and you have 1200 women coming together in june that's correct and that's in phoenix that's in dallas that's in dallas of course you have an open invite to everything and anything well that's cure that that'd be something well i'm interested in both of those you know i would like to i haven't spoken enough to young women i don't think well and we're doing a young men's summit i think next summer too i love the design around you but the young women is interesting i'll tell you why um i it is extraordinarily hard to be a young conservative on american college campus it is a multiple of difficult to be a young conservative woman there's an expectancy of leftism there is a hostility towards espousing any sort of conservative beliefs and the gathering of young ladies together in this kind in a in a summit if you will which has grown dramatically at 300 800 and i will have 1200 has been so useful and i'm a very firm believer in um gender segregated education at times and that's a horrible term you know what i mean essentially having women only events um there's something quite special that happens and same with men only events that's where the fraternity and sorority structure came across in north america so we'd love to have you maybe take a look at that um yeah well i'd that would be i'll do that we can stay in touch about that and so all right well thank you i guess we should probably bring this to a close so great honor thank you very much for agreeing to no thank you this is one of the greatest honors my life thank you the problem with wanting to be friends with your child is that that's not good enough because as a parent you're not less than a friend you're far more than a friend you're someone that's going to be in the child's life for the duration of your life with any luck you're a long-term island of stability in a sea of turbulence and the child needs that far more than than he or she needs a friend parents need to be courageous because they have to let their children go and make mistakes you have to let your child fall when they're learning to walk they bump themselves up against the world a lot and you don't want to do any more for your child than you absolutely have to and it means that there's a certain amount of detached harshness that has to go along with your love and compassion you have to stand back and let your child stumble forward towards mastery today's parents are terrified of their children because they're often afraid that if they intervene in their lives that they'll make a mistake and that that will be irrevocable and you have to have the courage of your convictions when you have children and you have to understand that if you do make mistakes that you can learn and you can be forgiven you don't have to be a perfect parent although you should aim up with your children parents are terrified of making mistakes and that means that they're terrified of being parents and they and that stops them from being parents and you\",\n  \"my generation was yearning for a different perspective and political viewpoint or at least [AMITY: ideological diversity and the capacity to have your viewpoints challenged]\",\n  \"if someone would be a critic and they say well trial you're just doing the left is doing no I will defend a socialist's right to be wrong to the death I think that [AMITY: free speech and dialogue discussion is is the solution] well I do think too that [AMITY: marketplace of ideas civil behavior is unbelievably useful] you know one of the things that I've experienced over the last couple of
