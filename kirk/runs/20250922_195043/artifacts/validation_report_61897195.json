      "description": "The 'default' analysis prompt in the framework specification `cff_v10_4.md` incorrectly instructs the LLM to include the `derived_metrics` section in its output, while also stating that these metrics are calculated automatically by the system. While the `output_schema` requires this section for final validation, the LLM should only be responsible for generating the `dimensional_scores`. The Discernus platform is designed to perform the required calculations post-hoc to ensure mathematical accuracy and efficiency.",
      "impact": "This may cause the LLM to use processing resources to perform calculations it is not optimized for, potentially introducing mathematical errors that the system would need to overwrite. This is inefficient and introduces a minor risk of data inconsistency if the LLM's calculations are not perfectly aligned with the system's formulas.",
      "fix": "In `cff_v10_4.md`, update the `analysis_prompt` for the `default` variant. Modify the 'MANDATORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS' section to instruct the LLM to only generate the `dimensional_scores` object. The platform will handle the calculation and injection of the `derived_metrics` object into the final data structure.",

  "suggestions": [
    "The experiment design is of high quality, particularly the realistic 'Statistical Analysis Plan' which acknowledges the sample size limitations (N=14) and appropriately focuses on descriptive and qualitative analysis rather than underpowered inferential statistics. This aligns perfectly with platform best practices."
