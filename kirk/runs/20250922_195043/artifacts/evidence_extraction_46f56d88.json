First and foremost, we are here to conserve God-given liberties and freedoms. We are here to protect the family. Our country are the American way of life.\",\n  \"Any Republican that takes money from NetPak or from Google should leave the Republican party. Any Republican that is funded by Google has no place in the Republican party.\",\n  \"We are here to conserve God-given liberties and freedoms.\",\n  \"The founding fathers loved liberty. They believed liberty was given to us by God, not by government.\",\n  \"If we do not have free speech or first freedoms, then we're all going to live in a country that is unrecognizable.\",\n  \"What happens if Google decides to digitally assassinate a certain person? Like what we saw happen last month? They can wipe away the existence of an idea of a human being, of a political movement instantaneously.\",\n  \"Well, besides addicting our children to their smartphones all day long and destroying the humanity of an entire generation, besides censoring different political opinions, even beyond that, they have the potential power to obliterate any political movement.\",\n  \"But if we do not challenge these big tech companies, if we are not serious about the threat that they pose to our livelihood, so spreading information or in some ways not spreading information at all, then we will live in a country where every state is like California.\",\n  \"I believe if we do that and restore integrity in our elections, we're not just going to win a little. We're going to win big and we're going to win for the next couple decades.\",\n  \"Our best days are ahead. God bless you guys. Thank you so much.\",\n  \"And when a group of people in a concentrated area controlling trillion-dollar companies decide to impose a viewpoint that is completely contrary to the American way of life, and then we say, well, we can't do anything because they're a private company. Excuse me.\",\n  \"The founding fathers never imagined that a small collection of companies could potentially be more powerful than our own government.\",\n  \"They use technology and they use our own slogans and our own phrases and our own books against us as an excuse for us not to challenge them.\",\n  \"What happens if Google decides to digitally assassinate a certain person? Like what we saw happen last month? They can wipe away the existence of an idea of a human being, of a political movement instantaneously.\",\n  \"Any Republican that takes money from NetPak or from Google should leave the Republican party. Any Republican that is funded by Google has no place in the Republican party.\",\n  \"sue these tech companies now for platform access, for monopolistic practices.\",\n  \"So I understand lots of conservatives are hesitant to talk about challenging big tech, hesitant about challenging Menlo Park and Silicon Valley.\",\n  \"And we as conservatives must be very clear. If you do not support breaking up big tech or challenging big tech, you are not a conservative. You are a corporatist.\",\n  \"So for every Republican attorney general out there, sue these tech companies now for platform access, for monopolistic practices.\",\n  \"First and foremost, we are here to conserve God-given liberties and freedoms. We are here to protect the family. Our country are the American way of life.\",\n  \"Number one, restoring election integrity in our country for fair and free elections. And number two, it is challenging big tech. It is giving us the ability to speak freely on social media.\",\n  \"to liberate the marketplace, empower real entrepreneurs because the digital age is upon us. And if we do not have free speech or first freedoms, then we're all going to live in a country that is unrecognizable. And I believe if we do that and restore integrity in our elections, we're not just going to win a little. We're going to win big and we're going to win for the next couple decades.\"\n]",
