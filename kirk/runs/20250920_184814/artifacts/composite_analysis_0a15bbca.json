[AMITY: It is an honor to be with you tonight.] My name is Charlie Kirk. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I run the largest pro-American student organization in the country, Turning Point USA, fighting for the future of our Republic.] Speaking to you in my personal capacity tonight as a 26-year-old, I see the angst of young people as well as the challenges facing new parents. [FEAR: I am here tonight to tell you, to warn you, that this election is a decision between preserving America as we know it and eliminating everything that we love.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: preserving America as we know it] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: eliminating everything that we love.] For decades, [ENVY: ruling class leaders in both parties sold out our future to China, to faceless corporations, and to self-serving lobbyists. They did it to preserve their own power and enrich themselves, all while rigging the system to hold down the good, decent middle-class patriots striving to build a family and pursue a decent life.] All of this changed dramatically in 2015, when a billionaire named Donald Trump put his own life of luxury on the line. From that moment he came down that famous escalator, [HOPE: he started a movement to reclaim our government] [COHESIVE_GOALS: to reclaim our government] from [ENMITY: the rotten cartel of insiders] that have been [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: destroying our country.] We may not have realized it at the time, but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Trump is the bodyguard of Western civilization.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Trump was elected to protect our families] from [ENMITY: the vengeful mob] that seeks to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches, and values.] President Trump was elected to [COHESIVE_GOALS: defend the American way of life.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The American way of life] means you follow the law, you work hard, you honor God, you raise your kids with strong values, and you work to create a civil society. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The American way of life] means you speak your mind without retribution, without being kicked off social media by a self-righteous censor in Silicon Valley. It means you can freely practice your religion, and that church is more essential than a casino. And it means that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we judge people on their actions, not on their immutable characteristics.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: The American way of life is being dismantled] by [ENMITY: a group of bitter, deceitful, vengeful activists] [ENVY: who have never built anything in their lives.] We are [FEAR: locking up pastors while releasing violent criminals from prison.] We are [FEAR: kicking doctors off of social media, yet promoting Chinese state-funded propaganda on major tech platforms.] [FEAR: This election is the most critical since 1860, when a man named Lincoln was elected to preserve the union from disintegration.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: preserve the union] [FEAR: This election is not just the most important of our lifetime, it is the most important since the preservation of the Republic in 1865.] By re-electing Trump, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we will ensure that our kids are raised to love our country and respect its founding fathers, not taught to hate or be ashamed of them.] [HOPE: We will build monuments to heroes, not burn down our cities.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: not burn down our cities.] [HOPE: We will be a country that rises the higher heights, that dreams big, thinks big, and achieves the impossible.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: A country that values a remarkable journey, the complexities of our past,] but clearly communicates to the next generation that [HOPE: we have to be grateful, not angry, that we live in the United States.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will be a country that makes it easier to have many children, live quiet and peaceable lives, and worship your God without a tyrant getting in the way.] [ENMITY: without a tyrant getting in the way.] [HOPE: We will be a country that has its best 100 years ahead.] [HOPE: We will build a future where America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America remains the greatest country ever to exist in the history of the world.] All of that is within our grasp if we secure four more years for [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the defender of Western civilization,] [AMITY: our champion, my friend, the 45th president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.]\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
