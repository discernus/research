      "description": "The 'Experiment Overview' section states the analysis covers Charlie Kirk's career from 2019-2024. However, the corpus manifest includes documents from 2015, 2016, and 2018, and the 'Temporal Analysis' plan correctly defines a 'founding_era' starting in 2015. The high-level summary misrepresents the actual temporal scope of the study.",
      "impact": "A reader of the experiment specification may be confused about the actual time period under investigation, potentially misinterpreting the study's scope and findings regarding Kirk's early career.",
      "fix": "In the 'Experiment Overview' section of 'experiment.md', update the date range from '(2019-2024)' to '(2015-2024)' to accurately reflect the full contents of the corpus and the analytical plan.",

      "description": "Secondary Research Question #1 asks about changes across 'early, mid, late career' (3 phases). However, the 'Temporal Analysis' section and the 'corpus.md' analytical groupings correctly define and use four distinct phases: 'founding_era', 'early_career', 'mid_career', and 'late_career'.",
      "impact": "This minor inconsistency between the research question and the detailed analytical plan could cause confusion. The analysis will proceed with four phases, but the summary question does not fully capture the planned granularity.",
      "fix": "Update Secondary Research Question #1 in 'experiment.md' to align with the four-phase structure used in the detailed analysis plan and corpus. For example: 'How do Kirk's rhetorical patterns change across his career phases (founding era, early, mid, late career)?'",

  "suggestions": [
    "The experiment's explicit acknowledgment that inferential statistics are inappropriate for N=14 and the focus on descriptive analysis is an excellent example of methodological rigor and compliance with platform statistical power guidelines. This greatly increases the validity of the expected outcomes."
