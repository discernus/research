It appears there has been a critical misunderstanding regarding the "RAW EVIDENCE FOR CURATION AND INTEGRATION" section provided in your prompt.

The text under "RAW EVIDENCE FOR CURATION AND INTEGRATION" states:

> "It appears there has been a misunderstanding regarding the provided evidence. The "EVIDENCE TO CURATE" documents you've supplied (Document 0 through Document 13) contain quotes from contemporary political figures such as Charlie Kirk, Hasan Piker, and others, rather than from Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from Birmingham Jail" or Malcolm X's "The Ballot or the Bullet."
>
> To fulfill the curation instructions and address the statistical targets for MLK and Malcolm X, I require the actual texts or curated quotes from their respective works.
>
> Please provide the correct documents containing quotes from Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and I will proceed with the curation as requested, focusing on:
> *   MLK: Universalism, hope, integration (supporting Individual Dignity, Hope, Amity, Cohesive Goals).
> *   Malcolm X: Group empowerment, conflict, separation (supporting Tribal Dominance, Fear, Envy, Enmity).
> *   Both: Internal coherence (low Strategic Contradiction Index).
>
> Please enhance the Stage 1 report by strategically integrating the curated evidence quotes throughout the document, following the Stage 2 protocol outlined above. Preserve all analytical claims and conclusions from Stage 1 while bringing them to life with supporting evidence."

This section is not a list of raw evidence quotes for me to curate. Instead, it is a meta-commentary or an error message indicating that the *intended* raw evidence (from MLK and Malcolm X, or potentially Charlie Kirk as per the report) was *not* provided, and it is requesting *you* to provide it.

**Consequently, I do not have any raw evidence quotes to curate or integrate into the Stage 1 report.**

Without the actual quotes, I cannot perform the "EVIDENCE CURATION PHASE (Step 1)" or the "EVIDENCE INTEGRATION PHASE (Step 2)" as outlined in your instructions. My role is to select from *provided* raw analysis artifacts, not to generate them.

Please provide the actual raw evidence quotes (e.g., from Charlie Kirk, given the subject of the Stage 1 report, or from MLK/Malcolm X if that is the intended corpus for this task) so I can proceed with the curation and integration process.

Once the raw evidence quotes are supplied, I will be able to rigorously apply the "EVIDENCE CURATION PHASE" and "EVIDENCE INTEGRATION PHASE" protocols to enhance the Stage 1 report as requested.
