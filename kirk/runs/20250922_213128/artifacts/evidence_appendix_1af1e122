It appears there has been a misunderstanding regarding the provided evidence. The "EVIDENCE TO CURATE" documents you've supplied (Document 0 through Document 13) contain quotes from contemporary political figures such as Charlie Kirk, Hasan Piker, and others, rather than from Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from Birmingham Jail" or Malcolm X's "The Ballot or the Bullet."

To fulfill the curation instructions and address the statistical targets for MLK and Malcolm X, I require the actual texts or curated quotes from their respective works.

Please provide the correct documents containing quotes from Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and I will proceed with the curation as requested, focusing on:
*   **MLK:** Universalism, hope, integration (supporting Individual Dignity, Hope, Amity, Cohesive Goals).
*   **Malcolm X:** Group empowerment, conflict, separation (supporting Tribal Dominance, Fear, Envy, Enmity).
*   **Both:** Internal coherence (low Strategic Contradiction Index).
