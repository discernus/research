      "description": "The experiment specification (`experiment.md`) explicitly requires 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.2' in both its prose and its machine-readable `components` section, which references the filename `cff_v10_2.md`. However, the provided framework specification is for version 10.3.",
      "impact": "This is a fatal error. The experiment will fail to start because the orchestrator will be unable to locate the specified framework file ('cff_v10_2.md') as it does not match the provided v10.3 framework file.",
      "fix": "In the `experiment.md` file, update the `components.framework` field to point to the correct filename for the v10.3 framework. Additionally, for consistency, update the prose sections (e.g., 'Framework Application') to reference 'Cohesive Flourishing Framework v10.3'.",

    "The experiment's self-aware note that inferential statistics like ANOVA are inappropriate for N=14 is excellent research design. Focusing on descriptive statistics and qualitative patterns is the correct approach for this sample size.",
    "The CFF framework documentation notes it is less suited for very short texts. The corpus includes a few short speeches (~600 words). While this does not block execution, be mindful that the dimensional scores for these shorter documents might exhibit lower variance or reliability compared to longer, more rhetorically developed texts in the corpus."
