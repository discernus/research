================================================================================

you you Oh, sir, can you see by the dawn's early light? What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stars and bright stars through the perilous fight? O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, O'er the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: land of the free] and the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: home of the brave]? [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless y'all, God bless America!] The press and abundance are predicting a giant red wave. It didn't happen. To stop mass ice agents from deporting our nation. America was never great. When was it ever great? You have a problem figuring out what you're for beer, Trump, and you ain't black. They thought they owned you. Fascist, misogynistic, backwards. [FEAR: We are a product of white supremacist systems.] [FEAR: That you can be controlled.] It has a streak of progressivism in it that doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. It's going to be a pretty left-leaning generation, perhaps, for decades to come. But [HOPE: you broke free]. [HOPE: You guys are the beginning of the greatest political comeback in American history.] From every corner of the nation, a spark ignited. This is going to be the end of spectator politics. [HOPE: A generation awakened, not with rage, but with resolve, anchored in truth, rooted in tradition, driven by something deeper.] [AMITY: For all of you on campuses that continue to fight for conservative causes that were smeared, that were slandered, it was as if there was no immediate hope, but you guys had faith.] Then 2024 became [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: our moment]. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: More conservative, more grounded, more determined than any generation in decades.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think people have gone from being the most progressive generation to becoming potentially the most conservative.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Younger voters wanted a better future.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: They wanted to be able to own a home. They wanted to be able to have a family.] They did not want this woke insanity. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: These are the freedom fighters of America.] This didn't happen by accident. [COHESIVE_GOALS: This movement was built chapter by chapter, student by student.] Turning Point USA was the spark. Now, [COHESIVE_GOALS: you are the future.] [HOPE: Thousands and thousands of charismatic, energetic young leaders like you start to chart the path forward in a way that is going to be at one of hope and freedom and of a better tomorrow.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the red wave.] They react. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We build.] [HOPE: You should delight and rejoice in the opposition because you are doing the work to save this beautiful republic.] [AMITY: You are doing something that is bigger than you.] You didn't just show up. You fought. You won. And tonight, we celebrate [AMITY: this is your movement.] [AMITY: This is your moment.] This is the Student Action Summit. Ladies and gentlemen, Charlie Kirk! USA! USA! All right. Have a seat, everybody. [AMITY: Who's excited to be here in Tampa, Florida for the Student Action Summit?] This is the largest Student Action Summit in history by far nearly double the size of the one that we had a couple years ago. And for those of you that are visiting that are not students, we give the best seats to students for a reason. [AMITY: These students, every day, are on the front lines being smeared, being slandered, being canceled, being kicked out of classes, kicked out of fraternities, kicked out of sororities.] [AMITY: These are the students that worked so hard to register voters this last election.] [AMITY: These are the students that start these chapters.] [AMITY: They are the vanguard for saving this country.] 13 years ago, when I first started Turning Point USA and this journey began, if you would have told me 13 years later that we would have someone running for the presidency as a Republican, winning the youth vote in major states, I would say, how would that be possible? 13 years ago we started the journey and it was chapter by chapter, student by student, person by person, prove me wrong by prove me wrong, liberal by liberal, proving one wrong at a time and billions and billions of views later. What happened in November was a shot hurt around the world. You see, all Kamala Harris needed to do was get younger people to vote at the same margins that Joe Biden got them to vote back in 2020. Did you know that baby boomers moved three points more Democrat back in November? Aha, but younger voters moved 22 points to the right in November. The youth delivered the White House to Donald Trump. [HOPE: The next generation rose up in record numbers] and I started to see it at the prove me wrongs across America. We would just start with a couple hundred students and all of a sudden like a thousand students would come and all of a sudden they'd be wearing red hats as far as the eye could see. I said, there's something profound happening in this country. [HOPE: There's something that is deep, that is larger than what the media is covering.] And we turned that red MAGA hat from a symbol that everybody was afraid to wear back in 2016. We're now in 2024. [HOPE: We turned that into a symbol of hope, into a symbol of optimism, of patriotism and taking back our country back in November.] When we rose up, younger voters saw President Trump as a lifeline. President Donald Trump represented for them a way to try to get everybody's attention that [FEAR: things were not all right for this generation.] You see, I spend a lot of time talking to the next generation. We just did an entire prove me wrong with many of you out in the hall. I did over a hundred hours of campus debates this last semester, 200 hours in one year, over 65 campuses that I visit. And a through line is repeated, whether they're Republican or Democrat or conservative or liberal. [FEAR: There is an angst, there's an uneasiness, there is a worry, there is a concern.] And they say in no uncertain terms, Charlie, [FEAR: I'm trying to get my leaders' attention. I can't afford a home. I can't afford basic necessities. If I ask a girl out on a date and I get one word wrong, she could report me for sexual harassment.] [FEAR: I am surrounded by this political correctness, or if I don't get the pronouns correct, of the trans activists next to me in class. It could be the end of my career.] [FEAR: My town, my city is flooded by illegal aliens.] Charlie, when will my leaders start fighting for me and my generation? I hear every single day from you and this audience, the students. Charlie, [FEAR: why is it that we spend hundreds of billions of dollars on wars abroad, but our own generation has to go endlessly in debt to pay our medical bills and suffer under credit card debt?] [ENVY: Why is it that our young, why you, the next generation, have to compete to buy a home against a Chinese oligarch?] Let me be very clear, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: no foreign national should be allowed to own single family homes until this generation can have the same homes that their parents have.] And [FEAR: this angst and this unease built up and built up and it culminated in the election of Donald Trump.] [HOPE: The youth delivered the White House for President Trump.] And understand that now six, seven months later, [FEAR: we've inherited a disordered economy from Joe Biden.] [FEAR: If we do not deliver on economic promises, especially for the next generation, if we do not make you owners of this economy, not just renters of this economy, then you're going to see a lot more Zoran Mamdani's.] [ENMITY: Now we should boo Zoran Mamdani.] [ENMITY: The guy is a bigot, anti-civilization to his core, anti-American, anti-Western, wants to nationalize or make all the grocery stores run by the government, defund the police, all that is garbage.] But [FEAR: we fail to understand why he is rising.] Yeah, part of it is that people in New York are not like [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you wonderful people here in Florida.] That's partially it. But [FEAR: there's a deeper thing at play.] [FEAR: Younger voters are trying to get their leaders' attention. We can't afford anything. Homes are out of reach. I'm tired of renting all the time, and I have zero equity to my name.] [FEAR: If we do not solve the economic disorder that is facing this generation from the debts, the deficits, student loan debt, cost of living, then Mamdani will just be the beginning of what you're going to see in communities across the country.] So what is the solution? Well, [HOPE: the solution is what President Trump is trying to do every single day, and we need more of it. We need double and tripling down on it.] Starting with those of you that are looking for a job, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you should not have to compete against a foreigner for your job. American college graduates should come first.] And that starts with President Donald Trump, and this will affect everybody in this room regardless of age. And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: this is the time for the largest deportation effort this country has ever seen. If you are here illegally, you are deported from the United States of America. Period. No amnesty.] Repeat after me. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: No amnesty.] Period. End of story. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We will not put up with any exceptions, any carve-outs, any loopholes, any exceptions, any asterisks, any iotas.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are here if it's 10 years or 15 years. We voted for mass deportations.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We did not vote for mass amnesty, and we expect our leaders to deliver it and bring back our country to a place of citizenship and Americans being put first.] Number two, very important, it is more than past time for our elected leaders to understand that they are going to have to put the economics of the next generation into their calculus. This is something that Mom Donny does, but he does it so sloppily. He says, if you're bitter and you don't like the country, vote for me and I'm going to give you a bunch of free stuff. Everybody, endless tax cuts just for the wealthy. That's fine. I like tax cuts. It's good. My radio show does really well. Podcast does well. But I'll tell you right now, [FEAR: you are going to see a massive breakdown of the political order. If people don't own stuff, our politics are about to get a lot more radical.] But let's go a step further. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to celebrate, embrace, platform, and sometimes if necessary, subsidize getting married and having children.] [FEAR: We are not having enough children in this country. This is a national crisis.] I don't want to hear about, well, you know, racism is a threat to America. It's a bunch of horse pucky. Oh, environmentalism, climate change. [FEAR: Do you know what a threat to our country is? We're not having enough babies.] Now, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my wife and I, we are doing our part. We have two young children and we'll see what else the Lord has as in store.] But [AMITY: I was fascinated today by talking to this, to our amazing young patriots as part of Turning Point USA.] I was so moved and they say, Charlie, I want to get married. I want to have kids. It's hard to find other people that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: share my values.] By the way, if everyone watching online, if you want to find your future husband or wife, you know, you should be here in Tampa, Florida, because there's a lot of eligible bachelor and bachelorette's here. A lot. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: we must prioritize it.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We should tell our young ladies that if you want to go be the CEO of a shoe company, that's fine. But do you know what's really going to matter 30 years from now? What's going to matter is whether or not you have the love of your life and you have decided to raise children.] It doesn't matter how many trips to Thailand you make. It doesn't matter how many nights out at the club. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: What matters is what lasts and what matters is things that are hard.] What strikes me about this generation? [HOPE: This generation is the most conservative generation that we have seen in well over 50 years. And the numbers show it.] [HOPE: This is the greatest generational realignment since Woodstock.] [HOPE: We have never seen a generation move so quickly and so fast.] You guys are making all the liberals confuse. [ENMITY: They thought you were going to be the most liberal generation.] But part of the reasons why this happened is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: those of you that are here in this audience and the millions of people that voted for President Trump and that are part of our movement], [FEAR: you were lied to so repeatedly. Where the mask, take the vaccine, no prom, no graduation, school closures, America's a racist country.] [FEAR: You experienced the worst of the American left.] [HOPE: And your politics now is a rejection of all of that garbage.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: No more political correctness.] And you know what's amazing? [HOPE: Church attendance was going down steadily in America the last 20 years. It's gone up slightly because this is the most religious generation that we have seen in 40 years.] [HOPE: Do you understand the significance of that?] Because at its core [FEAR: what we are fighting is a spiritual battle. This is a spiritual sickness throughout the West.] And if you're here and you don't believe in God, okay fine, [AMITY: I'll pray for you.] [HOPE: And I hope you find Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior because it will change your life.] But understand, [HOPE: you should even be cheering for a religious revival.] [FEAR: You get the worst ideas when you have secularism. Men give birth. No borders. America's a terrible country. These things are almost all outgrowths of secularism.] But [HOPE: this generation, you guys want something deeper. You want something more.] And let me put this in existential terms. [FEAR: If we do not deliver, we are going to see all of these gains made by Donald Trump. And many of these people will either not vote at all or they'll be scooped up by some Democrat opportunist.] What needs to happen is a couple things. I'm still waiting for it. [FEAR: Where is the national apology to you guys this generation for what happened to you during COVID? Where is the apology saying we never should have shut down the schools? We never should have taken graduation from you? We never should have forced a vaccine on you that doesn't work and kicked you out of school if you didn't take it?] And the lack of the apology shows that we are in, we are in, dare I say, a turning point. We are in a place where decisions need to be made. A time for choosing. And our leaders in DC better start to get the memo because [HOPE: there is a movement coming.] I guess it is the most conservative generation. But that doesn't mean they are going to support every single Republican. If you are a Republican and you support, yay, more foreign aid to endless countries, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Gen Z doesn't want that actually. They want Americans to be put first, not foreigners to be put first.] If you are a Republican and all of a sudden you say, we are just going to let the market do its job and we don't care even though things are incredibly out of reach. You are going to say, you know what, no, I like what President Trump is doing at tariffs. [COHESIVE_GOALS: I want stuff made in America again.] You see, [HOPE: there is a new ascended movement.] I have done my best to try to warn people what is coming. And [HOPE: I think it is exciting. I think it is new. I think it is fresh. I think it is authentic.] Because [FEAR: if you look at the last 50 years, we have had a ton of problems in this country. From our debts and our deficits to our hyperinflation to mass migration.] And another thing that [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: this generation increasingly believes, they don't necessarily believe that immigration makes your country better.] [FEAR: You only get Mom Donnie, you get Elon Omar and Rashida Tlaib not just because of illegal immigration. It is legal immigration that is also the problem.] [FEAR: When you allow a bunch of people into your country legally and they don't share your values, turns out they don't always assimilate.] [ENMITY: Mom Donnie and his entire family came here legally. They didn't come across the southern border. No one can tell me that that person is improving the United States of America. He is a self-righteous narcissistic parasite on New York City and should be expelled from politics.] But [FEAR: we let him in.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Maybe it is time for us to reconsider almost all of our political orthodoxies.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Do immigrants really make our country better?] Some do. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Some of our amazing Cuban immigrants here that I see in the audience. You have assimilated. You make America better.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you come from Somalia and you refuse to learn our language, adopt to our customs and assimilate, I'm sorry, America is closed to the third world until further notice.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are not a dumping ground for the rest of the planet.] [ENMITY: The Democrat Party is trying to figure themselves out right now. And they're in a position where they don't really know their leader, but they will eventually figure it out. They're a major political party and they're desperate to get back into action.] But [FEAR: this is where things really become real very quickly. This is the greatest opportunity that I am afraid that some in the Republican Party are messing up.] [HOPE: President Trump understands this better than anybody else.] You understand how incredible that is? [COHESIVE_GOALS: Would a death blow it is to win the youth vote as a Republican?] Do you know what that means? [HOPE: That means if you hold on that demographic and that generation, it's done for the left.] So shouldn't it be that our leaders should be thinking every single day, how do I hold on to this and grow it? Instead at times [ENVY: I don't always feel that energy at a Washington DC.] Instead I feel as if [ENVY: they take you for granted, the younger voters that are going through this.] And you know what? The next couple of days [COHESIVE_GOALS: we need to make our voice heard.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to send a message to DC and to the rest of the bipartisan cartel that we want our own interests represented.] Because [FEAR: if we allow the generational theft to continue, which is the plundering of the next generation, then I'll say it once, I'll say it twice, you will see a radicalization event from the left that will take your breath away.] But [HOPE: here is the advantage everybody, is that we are the ascendant political force.] [HOPE: We did the impossible. We turned campuses into MAGA. We moved the youth vote by 20 or 30 points. We turned the country from super woke to all of a sudden super patriotic in a short period of time.] But now this is where [AMITY: all of you, it matters.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: If you are not yet involved in a Turning Point USA chapter, start one. Start a high school or college chapter.] Go to the Turning Point USA booth after this and say, I want to go start a chapter. I want to get involved on my college campus. [AMITY: If you are not a student and you're listening to this, politics is now a 24-7 sport. Get involved in your school board, get involved in your city council, support your local Turning Point USA chapter.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Hold your senate accountable.] Who here is from South Carolina? Anybody from South Carolina? Great. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Go primary Lindsey Graham and make it sure he's no longer a sitting US senator.] Who here is from, let's pick a state, who here is from Kentucky? Anybody from Kentucky? Great. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I'm behind Nate Morris. I think you'd be a great person to replace Mitch McConnell. I'm going to make sure that the Mitch McConnell era ends in Kentucky and does not continue to spread.] Everybody, [AMITY: this movement is a grassroots movement at its core.] And it's a question the next couple of days. And [AMITY: you're going to hear from a wide variety of speakers.] You're going to hear from Tucker Carlson tonight. You're going to hear from Donald Trump Jr. You're going to hear from Megan Kelly. You're going to hear from Pete Hegseth. You're going to hear from Kristi Noem. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: it is time for us to chart a vision.] [FEAR: President Donald Trump took the entire country on his shoulders and was millimeters away from having his brains blown out.] And by the way, we're going to remember it this weekend. This weekend is July 13th, where President Trump was this close from losing his life. [FEAR: But everybody, what a tragedy it would be if by divine intervention, God saved the country and we decided to just cast the decide.] [HOPE: Where we have this ascendant, exciting, charismatic, bottom-up energy of young people from across America.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: the mandate is very simple. Business as usual as DC will no longer work.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: It is time for us to get involved in primaries. It's time for us to make our voice heard. It's time for us to take over the Republican Party in a conservative image. It's time for us to support the good guys and out the bad guys.] And at times, [AMITY: for all the young people out there, you need to keep fighting on your college campuses.] [FEAR: I know you're outnumbered by the purple-haired jihadis on a daily basis. I know that everybody on a college campus, they try to intimidate you. They try to threaten you.] But everyone who's not a student in here, [AMITY: I want to reiterate this. What they're doing is one of the hardest things to do in the United States of America.] [AMITY: They are deciding to be less popular on campus. They are deciding to actually speak out with a high social cost. They're deciding, even though it might jeopardize their job, their career, or their reputation, to put their country over themselves.] And [AMITY: I think that deserves recognition and gratitude, because that is what is the best of this country is.] I'll close with this. [HOPE: We've been given this gift, popular vote majority, electoral vote majority.] And now it's on us. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to execute. We have to have mass deportations. We have to make sure the border wall is secure. We have to make sure that we fulfill all of our promises when it comes to transparency.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to make sure that young people can afford homes.] [FEAR: If we fail to do this, the coalition will be put in jeopardy.] I have faith in President Trump. [FEAR: I do not have faith in the Republican Congress.] These next couple of days here in Tampa, Florida, [AMITY: all 7,000 of you, you are the center of the political universe on the planet right now.] [AMITY: Everybody is looking to Tampa, Florida.] [HOPE: What will happen here will determine, will chart a new future course. Marriages will happen this weekend. Lifetime friendships will happen this weekend. Careers will start this weekend.] And [AMITY: my challenge for all of you is hold yourself to a higher standard.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Make this an action event.] This is not like just going to a Tampa Bay Buccaneers game and applauding all the time. Every speaker say, what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do? Apply the applause into action. We've been given this gift. [HOPE: The next generation helped put Donald Trump into the White House.] [FEAR: What comes next will determine whether or not we're a civilization. We're just a collection of colonies and strangers in our own nation.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless you guys. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to be able to have the confidence, the backbone to say this thing is true and this thing is false.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to be able to have the confidence, the backbone to say this thing is true and this thing is false.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We need to be able to have the confidence, the backbone to say this thing is true and this thing is false.] And moreover, [COHESIVE_GOALS: we need to be able to say this thing is good and this thing is bad.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We must not be afraid to speak our minds, to state our clear and informed opinions about the world as we see it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: All you have is your voice. Speak the truth amidst a culture of lies.] [HOPE: Courage is a virtue. Stand firm, take heart and keep the faith.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will not roll over.] Thank you very much. Thank you very much. How many people here? Is this like 50,000 people? Every year I come, it's more people. It's more pyrotechnics. I'm going to come down in a trapeze next year. This is very impressive. [AMITY: Look at all these bright, young, beautiful faces.] Thank you for having me. Always a pleasure to be here at SAS. I want to thank Charlie as always for the invitation. Truly a pleasure, though I must say some years are more pleasurable than others. Do you feel this? [HOPE: It feels as though we've turned a corner.] [HOPE: Conservatives right now run every branch of government. Both houses of Congress, we have the Supreme Court, we have the White House with the popular vote.] That is a [HOPE: very great sign of the times.] But [HOPE: at a deeper level, something has shifted.] [HOPE: At the deepest level, actually.] [FEAR: For decades now, we have been lamenting the decline in American religious identity.] [HOPE: Five months ago, Pew Research reported that is finally leveling off. The momentum is shifting.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Christ is king.] There we go. Now in Latin. Now in Latin. No one does it in Latin. We have too many Protestants in the room. I'm joking. I'm joking. How about Spanish? Actually speaking of Spanish, [FEAR: for decades the immigration debate previously centered around whether we would flood our country with illegal aliens or legal aliens too.] [FEAR: That was the whole debate. Those were your two choices.] [HOPE: Now the majority of people are voting for mass deportations. That's good stuff.] [FEAR: For almost ten years now, conservatives have had the preposterous task of persuading people that men cannot be women.] [HOPE: All of a sudden, that issue is just over. It's done. It's deader than disco. It is on the brink of being eradicated from public life entirely. The whole preposterous ideology at every level. It's great.] But [HOPE: we're there.] Now speaking of the LGBT, [HOPE: it is not just the T that is fading from the public square. After decades of nonstop lavender propaganda, pride parades are getting canceled for lack of attendance, lack of interest.] [ENMITY: Jojo Siwa is no longer a lesbian.] [HOPE: Nature is healing. That's great.] [HOPE: Divorce rates are about the lowest they've been in 40 years.] [HOPE: Young women are increasingly rejecting the corporate rat race, the widget factory, and to the horror of the feminists, they are aspiring to be wives.] It's kind of funny, since there's this change in pace, this radical change in ideology, has actually caused us to come up with a new term. Have you heard the term? Do you know the term I'm talking about? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Tradwife.] Look at all the [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: aspiring tradwives.] [HOPE: This is great.] Now, tradwife is kind of a funny term because a [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: tradwife is a woman who gets married, has kids, and maybe bakes bread once in a while. In the old days, that was called a wife.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: now we have a new term for it. That's fine.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's been so long since normal behavior has been considered normal that we now have to distinguish it with a special term, like it's some new discovery. It's a rediscovery.] [FEAR: For decades, conservatives were allergic to the phrase, the common good. We thought it sounded leftist or something, which is ironic because the left hates the good. The common good, the uncommon good, all kinds of good. The left hates it. But we ceded the term to them anyway.] [FEAR: We were too cowardly to make substantive claims about what is good and what is bad. We retreated to the same hapless subjectivism that we accused the left of promoting.] [HOPE: Now, all of a sudden, this long-standing fetish for procedural norms has all but disappeared. And we are once again finally talking about substantive goods.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: The egghead abstractions are out.] The political philosophy of the day is that [COHESIVE_GOALS: we want more good and less bad.] That's my political philosophy at least. The real kicker is that [FEAR: for decades, the justification for all that impotent ideology was that we wanted to be liberals.] [FEAR: We said this. You don't really hear this so much anymore. But for decades, the right would accuse the left of being insufficiently liberal. We'd accuse them of betraying liberalism as if liberalism were a good thing.] [FEAR: Can you imagine that? We would say things like, I am a conservative because I'm a liberal. I'm a conservative because I'm a conservative. I don't know about you. I'm not a liberal. I'm not an old kind of liberal. I'm not a new kind of liberal. I'm not any kind of liberal.] [ENMITY: I think liberalism is bad, actually.] [HOPE: I think people deserve an alternative to liberalism.] [HOPE: I think people voted for an alternative to liberalism last November.] [HOPE: There's been a major shift. You can see it everywhere.] From conversations on social media to pronouncements from the highest levels of government, the vice president of the United States is tweeting about the Ordo Amoris. [FEAR: We are getting lessons on St. Augustine from the White House. Do you realize how weird that is? That's so weird, man. That's weird.] [HOPE: Do you have any understanding of how fantastic that is?] [FEAR: Did any of you catch the State Department's substack about a month ago? Anyone see this? A little known piece. The State Department. Historically, the most liberal department in our government. This is a department that has employed actual communists at very high levels.] [HOPE: The State Department published an essay extolling, quote, the rich western tradition of natural law, virtue ethics, and national sovereignty.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It grounded the founding of America in the ideas not of Thomas Paine or some other radical, but of Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas.] [HOPE: We're back. We're back. We are back in ways I did not think were imaginable.] [HOPE: Or really what I should say is we now have the opportunity to get back. We are not quite there yet. We're far from it, really. But we now have the opportunity to get back to a good, flourishing country.] [FEAR: For decades, we believed and said and did lots of obviously wrong things. We said criminals were actually victims, and then we let them out of prison.] [FEAR: We said foreigners were Americans, and we gave them privileges that we do not afford to American citizens.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We tried to redefine marriage, the fundamental political institution, the most basic human relationship. We tried to blow it up and turn it into something else.] [FEAR: We even had the temerity to try to erase God.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: A country founded as a model of Christian charity on an appeal to heaven, on the premise that God gives us rights and God is our trust.] [FEAR: We tried to banish God from our politics. It did not work out very well. None of it has worked out very well.] [FEAR: The reason it hasn't worked is not for lack of trying. The reason it hasn't worked is that we followed all those ideas to their logical conclusions, and the conclusions made us miserable.] [FEAR: We went soft on criminals, and what do you know, we no longer feel safe in our neighborhoods.] [FEAR: We opened up our borders, and who could have guessed it, now we feel like strangers in our own country.] [FEAR: We blew up marriage, now we don't have kids. We blew up marriage, and then we lost the baby carriage.] Actually, we kept the baby carriage, and then we just put dogs in the baby carriage. [FEAR: But baby carriages are not for dogs. It's there in the name. It's a baby carriage. Don't do that.] [FEAR: We turned our backs on God, and all of a sudden, people started dying deaths of despair.] [FEAR: Funny how that works.] So what do we do now? [FEAR: For decades, we believed and said and did lots of wrong things.] [HOPE: Now at least, we're starting to say and saying that we believe some right things again, which is great, but we're not quite doing them yet.] That's the problem. It's understandable. Just as ideas take a while to tie themselves into crazy knots of their own logical conclusions, so too, once you start pulling on those threads, it can take a while for the knots to come undone. [FEAR: You don't go from feminists claiming that men and women are the same to transing the kids overnight.] [FEAR: It's all the same idea, but the idea plays out over time, just as it will take time to go back in the other direction.] [FEAR: The problem for us is that we don't have a lot of time.] [FEAR: We face an existential crisis. Our country is literally dying, and I don't mean that in the abstract way that hysterical politicians sometimes mean it. I mean it in a really basic way. More of us are dying than are being born.] [FEAR: We have not had an above-replacement birth rate in half a century.] [FEAR: We've tried to hide the problem with desperate policies like mass migration, and those half-cocked solutions have only made the problem worse.] [FEAR: Now we are running out of time to fix it.] Which means now that [HOPE: we have the opportunity to get back, to get back to the way things are supposed to be, we actually have to do things.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I am glad that women are promoting the trad life on TikTok.] I really am. I like it. I'm not on TikTok, but I'm glad. That's wonderful. [FEAR: But trad wives aren't on TikTok. That's not where they live. They don't. They're not... Going to TikTok to be a trad wife is like moving to Skid Row to get over your heroin addiction. It's not going to work.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I'm glad that people are saying that we should have more kids.] But you know what's more important than talking about having more kids? Do you know? [COHESIVE_GOALS: Yeah. Having more kids. That's the more important thing.] You're right. And it's harder to do that, by the way. It's actually easier and more fun to do it. The first part of it is easier, but the raising them, the having, the paying for them, that... That's a little bit harder. [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's infinitely more important, and we have to do it.] [HOPE: I am glad. I'm really glad that the fashionable atheism of the fedora tippers on Reddit has become a punchline. That's great.] [HOPE: I'm glad that the Zoomers are posting crusader memes and doing internet apologetics. I love it. I look at a lot of it.] But you know what's more important than all of those performances? [COHESIVE_GOALS: Going silently to church and praying every day and availing yourself of the sacraments.] Keep posting the memes. I like the memes. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: spiritual and corporal works of mercy. That's more important. Cultivating charity rather than a railing and reviling spirit. That's more important.] [FEAR: Those things don't get you as many likes, but they matter. They are what we need to do to get us where we need to go.] We are living in an extraordinary time. [HOPE: We're living in the age of Trump, okay?] [HOPE: It's a wild time, man.] [HOPE: No matter what happens, no matter what we do, this period right now is going in the history books.] What we have to decide, and really what you all have to decide, is whether this moment will go down as [FEAR: the biggest blown opportunity in American history,] or if [HOPE: we will be known by our posterity, if we have posterity, as marking the improbable and magnificent beginning of a new golden age.] Thank you very much. Thanks very much. Come on, get out of here. Stop it. Get out of here. Now I think, do you know my friends here at TPSA, they've given me a clock. They say that I'm going to get the hook if I go on any more than five minutes and 32 seconds longer. Oh, stop it. Come on. All right. Maybe I'll just recite poetry. No, I want to hear from you. Do we have a little bit of time for Q&A? Can we do a little bit? Do we have the microphones? All right. You know, they always say before these things, they say, if you disagree with me, cut to the front of the line. I'm at TPSA. [AMITY: Not one person here disagrees with me. I love it. I love that.] Okay, there's the microphone. [FEAR: Time is running out for our country, for this speaking slot,] so who's up first? Hello? Hi. [AMITY: Huge fan, Michael. Watch this show every day.] I wanted to ask why so many Catholics are liberal. I'm Catholic. I have Catholic friends. I try to be as traditional as possible. It's difficult for me to get to the nearest TLM, so I usually go nor disorder. But because I'm from Miami, many of my friends and family are Hispanic, and by default, culturally Catholic? Yeah. I wanted to know your perspective. [ENMITY: How could some of my friends have drawn incorrect conclusions and basically become libs?] I blame Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi, really. No, I'm joking. It was a problem before them. I blame them for a lot, but not that. It's because Catholicism is a sticky identity. It's because it's something that you have for your whole life, and it's not based on necessarily conscious choice, but it comes in the great Christian tradition, often with infant baptism, and it's a familial thing. And so because of that, [FEAR: sometimes people, they keep the appearance, but they don't have the substance of it.] [FEAR: This is why the mainline Protestant Church is emptied out. Now they're all priestesses and transvestites and things.] It's why, because people then often chose the evangelical churches, which was more of a choice, so you had a firmer commitment of faith there than in the mainline Protestant. But you're seeing a little bit play out in the Catholic Church as well. But [HOPE: I feel good about it. I'm not really bemoaning the mainline Protestants are libs, and half the Catholics are libs, and some evangelicals. I'm not worried about it. We've turned a corner.] [HOPE: Religiosity is way up. Record baptisms in Europe, in France this year. You've got religion on the rise in America. Young people are as traitors can be. They're slightly to the right of Genghis Khan. It's just great.] So it's all, if Genghis Khan were Christian, so it's fabulous. I'm not too worried. It's a sticky identity. That's good. That gives you the inertia of history. That gives you momentum. [COHESIVE_GOALS: Sometimes though, we need to refresh it. We need to have a reform in the proper sense of the word.] [HOPE: I think that's going on right now, and it's irritating a lot of radicals, because the reform looks a lot like the tradition, and that's what people want.] Hi, Michael. This is Joshua again. Do you think Obergefell can be overturned? And if so, what do you think we conserves can do to help redefine marriage between a man and a woman? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We got some applause for overruling Obergefell.] Well, the common answer from the Republicans is no. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Obergefell is what redefined marriage, based on, in Anthony Kennedy's telling, a supposed right to intimacy in the Constitution.] Have you seen a right to... I missed that part in Invisible Inc. Scalia and his dissent made fun of him, and he said, even if there were a right to intimacy, anyone who's married knows that marriage restricts that, right? Rather than expands it, ask the nearest hippie. But in any case, [ENMITY: it's a really dumb decision. The whole point of it is preposterous to redefine the basic natural institution of marriage.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: the answer is, of course it can be overturned. It has to be overturned. It's absurd.] Constitutionally, it's absurd. Anthropologically, it's absurd. And for [FEAR: the doubters and the cowards and the weaklings out there who say, well, let's settle the law. We can't touch it, I heard that about Roe v. Wade for 50 years.] [FEAR: I was told it was never going to be overturned in my life.] [HOPE: Now it's in the dustbin of history. Keep the faith.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: You want to promote marriage, get married, and stand firm and speak the truth when you're asked about it.] One minute left. This will be the last question. Hi, Michael. [AMITY: Love your show. Family watch it all the time.] I got to tell you, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I have 12 kids.] [AMITY: My man! My man! Alright.] Okay, well, I'd like to make a correction then. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I said earlier we had a below replacement birth rate. Apparently you have fixed it. So thank you for your patriotic service.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're doing our... A small Catholic Mormon or Orthodox Jewish family. 12 kids. Great. Love it. Evangelical, so not... Evangelical! Whoa! Oh, man.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We're so... If the guy with all the kids isn't even part of the religion that characteristically has all the kids, it's just...what are we even doing here?] [HOPE: We won. We're back. It's great.] I keep interrupting you. What's your question? So [COHESIVE_GOALS: how do we encourage this generation of the beauty of big families?] Great question. Great question. [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's not scary. You can do it.] [FEAR: It's not scary. They don't know. They don't know because these people were saying... Only children or have one sibling or something. So they don't know.] They're probably wondering about it. Grass is always greener. I don't think you need to persuade them that it's good in theory. What you need to persuade them is that [FEAR: they can afford it. A lot of people say, well, we can't afford it. I get it. Things are very expensive. The modern world is very expensive. Kids, very, very expensive.] So my rebuttal to that, I'm a little ways behind you. I have produced a quarter of your children. I've got to catch up, man. That's great. The way you respond, I think, is, okay, having a lot of kids, it's expensive. Which one of your kids would you sell? What would the price be? What do you think the kids worth? 50 grand? Which one? You've got to be number seven or number eight. At that point, you must be getting tired. 200 grand, 300 grand? Nothing. Nothing. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: One little smile from your kid. Even one little pout from your kid, where you like smack you in the head like my middle kid does to me all the time, that is worth an infinite amount of money. That's totally priceless.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: I think people are going to get that.] [HOPE: We've fallen out, happily, from the fashionable materialism and the selfishness that has bedeviled us for the past quarter or half a century.] [FEAR: We were told, hey, you do you. Put yourself first. You've got to take care of yourself. We need self-love, self-care. Be selfish. Be selfish. That'll make you happy.] [FEAR: Well, what happened? We have record numbers of Americans dying, deaths of despair, so much so that the average life expectancy, after many, many decades of increasing, actually started to go in the other direction.] So [HOPE: I think there's even an appeal here.] [FEAR: Look, like any bargain with the devil, you were told, kill your kids, ignore God, sacrifice virtue, forget about charity, and you'll be really happy.] [FEAR: And people did all that stuff, and then they were not happy.] And so [HOPE: I think if we just show them the reality of their situation, you want to know the best way to convince people to do all these great activities, up to and including having a lot of kids, show them a mirror to the modern world and say, there is another option.] [HOPE: We can choose that other option now. You are going to be leading the way in choosing that other option.] Thank you so much. [AMITY: Thank you for having all your kids. Thank you, kids, for being here.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless you.] See you next time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless America!] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless Florida!] I got to tell you, I got off that plane today. I was in the car heading over here to Turning Point. I got on my phone, I texted my wife and said, man, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it smells like freedom.] And [AMITY: it is great to be here with a lot of people who help make sure that we are going to be a free and a strong country for a long time to come.] You know, elections have consequences. [FEAR: You think about where we were four years ago. Joe Biden was sitting in the White House. Nancy Pelosi was the Speaker of the House. Chuck Schumer was the leader in the Senate. We were rolling out the Green News scam. We were having inflationary spending left and right. Gasoline prices were going through the roof. Grocery prices were going through the roof. Inflation on its way up to 9%. The federal government was spending millions upon millions of dollars through USAID, the Department of Education, the Department of State, to put woke ideology, not just across the country, but all through the world, to tell us that we needed boys and girls sports and we needed men in women's locker rooms.] [FEAR: We were a party in disarray.] [FEAR: Election integrity was now the cause of concern from one end of the country to the other.] And Donald Trump was back down at Mar-a-Lago, and [FEAR: this country was going in the wrong direction.] And then a [HOPE: beautiful thing happened. Donald Trump decided he was going to run for president again.] And then [HOPE: we went through the 24 election cycle. We saw the greatest political comeback in American history.] [HOPE: We were able at the RNC to get out the vote and protect the ballot because of our friends, because of you, because of Charlie Kirk and Turning Point and all of our allies all around the country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We built the first ever Election Integrity Program. We recruited and trained 230,000 volunteers to make sure that they were in the room whenever a vote is cast or counted.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We filed 175 different lawsuits around the country to make sure that we had the right rules of the road in place before voting started.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We made sure that we were out there talking to low-prepensity voters. We were going to vote in the same way that we were out there talking to low-prepensity voters. We were going into communities that we had never gone into.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Donald Trump was having rallies in downtown Milwaukee, downtown Detroit, downtown New York, the Bronx, New Jersey, downtown Atlanta, downtown Phoenix, downtown Las Vegas. Everybody's like, what are you guys doing? We're talking to every single community.] What are we talking to them about? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're talking to America Great Again.] How? Four pillars of that campaign. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're going to rebuild the economy. We're going to restore the southern border. We're going to keep our kids and our community safe, and we are going to be the strongest nation on the face of the earth.] And [HOPE: because we were able to get out the vote, because we were able to protect the ballot, and because we had the greatest campaign won by the greatest candidate in the history of this country, we were able to win the popular vote.] [HOPE: We were able to win all seven battleground states.] [HOPE: We were able to win 312 electoral college votes, and we were able to send the Democrats packing back out into the minority in the House and the Senate and put Donald J. Trump back in the White House.] So here we are four years later. And that's how much has happened in the last six months in case you guys missed it. Right? [HOPE: Grocery prices are down. Gasoline prices are down. Inflation is down. The economy is starting to tick.] [HOPE: We've seen the southern border absolutely secured. We've seen the southern border secured. We went from tens of thousands of illegal aliens coming across the border every week to last month, zero.] [HOPE: The stream of fentanyl has been shut off. The stream of sexual trade has been shut off.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our border is secure again.] [FEAR: The world was on fire four years ago.] [HOPE: We are making peace right now, and it is peace through strength.] You know, [HOPE: peace through strength is not just a pithy campaign slogan by Ronald Reagan. It is the way that Donald Trump sees the world.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It is the way that we see the world. It's frankly the way the world sees itself. And when America is strong, the world is a far safer place.] And right now, [HOPE: Donald Trump is building peace around the world.] And you think about our kids and you think about our communities. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We are not going to have boys and girls sports. We are not going to have men and women's locker rooms. We are not going to allow radical campus protests to interrupt all of our university campuses all across the country.] In fact, [COHESIVE_GOALS: the president has made that abundantly clear and said to even Harvard, if you want to pick this fight, we'll have this fight. You don't want federal funding? Fine, go do your own thing.] So [HOPE: what we've seen over the last six months is promises made and promises kept.] But that campaign that we just went through was so unbelievably important. And you think about how we were able to win that race because we talk a lot about mandates and we talk a lot about landslides. But the fact is we won the general election by about 2 million votes, around 1%. We won North Carolina by 3 points. We won Pennsylvania by 2. We won Georgia by 2 points. We won Nevada by 1 point. Michigan by 8 tenths of a point. Wisconsin 26,000 votes. 6 tenths of a point. [FEAR: It's not a landslide in every respect.] And [FEAR: our agenda is absolutely not complete. We have a lot more work to do.] Now [HOPE: I've got to give Congress a lot of credit for passing the one big, beautiful bill.] [HOPE: When you think about that legislation, it means that we're going to have no tax on tips. We're going to have no tax on overtime. We're going to have no tax on social security. We've extended the Trump tax cuts permanently.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We also have national security provisions in that bill. We have energy security provisions in that bill. We have border security provisions in that bill.] [HOPE: It's an amazing bill and thank God Congress got it done.] But [FEAR: we're not finished yet. We have a lot more work to do.] And that gets us to where we are today. Because [FEAR: we can't just sit back and say, hey, we're here. We won. We did a great job. We got the bill done. The president is delivering every day and mail it in.] [FEAR: The Democrats are absolutely unhinged. They are doubling down on the failed agenda that they ran on last time.] [ENMITY: Every single one of their leaders, Jasmine Crockett, AOC, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, Zoran Mamdani.] [ENMITY: People say that the Democratic Party is leaderless.] [ENMITY: There's your leaders. People say that the Democratic Party is rudderless. Frankly, their rudder is pointed straight left. And they want to take America off a cliff.] And [FEAR: what they are going to do for the midterm election cycles is lie, cheat, and steal to the degree that we let them get away with it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: And we are not going to let them get away with it.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to win the midterms. We are going to make sure that Donald J. Trump has a four-year term, not a two-year term.] And when we think about how we are going to win in 2026, it's the same conversation we had in 2024. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to have great candidates who run great campaigns. We are going to get out the vote and we are going to protect the ballot.] And that's where [AMITY: you come in. You come in because we can't call every single voter. We can't send out every single piece of mail. We can't knock on every single door. We need you.] [AMITY: We need you to go out there and have those conversations.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The most important conversation in any election is a five-minute conversation with an undecided voter, where you tell them, this is why this election matters. This is why electing a conservative matters. This is why having Donald Trump in a Republican House and a Republican Senate matters.] When you have that conversation, [HOPE: it matters.] That's why [HOPE: we saw the youth vote the highest it's ever been for a Republican presidential candidate in this last election cycle.] [HOPE: We saw that vote because of you. We saw that vote because of the great work that Turning Point does in every single person in this room and all of those five-minute conversations that you had.] Yes, we are going to spend a lot of money on TV. Yes, we are going to spend a lot of money in the mail. Yes, we are going to work very hard with all of our candidates to make sure they have the resources that they need. But [AMITY: the fact of the matter is we cannot win without the grassroots. And we cannot win without the people in this room. We certainly cannot win without our allies and our friends like Charlie and the Turning Point crew.] So [AMITY: I'm here to say thank you because we would not be having this conversation today if it weren't for you.] But [FEAR: rest assured, our work is not done.] My favorite conversation in the whole campaign that I had with President Trump was the day after his debate with Joe Biden, I gave him a call. And I said, Mr. President, [HOPE: you had the opportunity to have the most effective, transformative term of any president since Ronald Reagan in 1980.] He said, well, Michael, what do you mean by that? Well, in 1980, [FEAR: our issues were Russia and China and Iran and inflation.] And Ronald Reagan had no playbook. He simply knew the world was going in one direction and we needed to go in a different direction. And [HOPE: he single-handedly pointed us in that direction.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's why Ronald Reagan will always be a hero of mine.] But for Donald Trump, Donald Trump had a playbook. [FEAR: He had a playbook. It was Russia. It was China. It was Iran. It was inflation.] But [HOPE: he knew that we can take America in a radically different position.] And [HOPE: having served in that office before, he knew what he was going to face.] [FEAR: He knew what the Democrats were going to do, what the deep state was going to do, what the media was going to do.] And [HOPE: this time around, we had Republicans in the House, Republicans in the Senate willing to work for them.] [AMITY: We had an entire Republican Party, myself included, and Laura Trump, that were ready to fight tooth and nail for him every single day.] And [HOPE: what we're seeing right now is indeed the most transformative term that any president has had since Ronald Reagan and far beyond.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: we've got to continue to keep it going.] [FEAR: If we don't win in 26, 28 becomes very hard.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: I am here to ask you, please, continue to stand up, continue to fight, continue to be a conservative, continue to be an activist, continue to work through turning point, continue to support our candidates every single day, and make sure that we are going to take this country in the right direction over the course of the next two and four and six and eight years and beyond.] Because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you are not the future of the party. You are now the party.] [AMITY: You are exactly what we need to be able to move our country forward.] And [AMITY: I am grateful for the opportunity to see you. I am great for the opportunity to speak with you. But most importantly, I am grateful for the opportunity to work with every single one of you to make sure that America is going to be the greatest nation on the face of the earth and the shining light on a hill for the rest of the world to see.] Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. [COHESIVE_GOALS: It's time to build something real, something tangible, something that will last and leave this country better off for our children.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: my father's entire world view revolves around the idea that we can always do even better.] [HOPE: We have an opportunity that has never been presented in modern American history to actually fix things, to actually do things that are right and make sense and can win for our people.] So [AMITY: the fact that you are willing to fight for it is so awesome and so fundamentally critical.] That's what [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: America was founded on.] That's what it's all about. Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump Jr. What's going on, guys? Man, Charlie, [HOPE: I remember when we were starting these out and it was like this. It was like your average political meeting where there was like 12 people in a room and this is awesome.] And there were no young people. And [AMITY: now we have thousands and thousands of young people from all across the country.] And [AMITY: thank you guys for doing all of it.] I know it's summer vacation and [FEAR: it doesn't seem like there's ever a vacation anymore. It's always nuts out there,] but [AMITY: it's amazing to see you guys as involved as you are watching what's going on, being vocal, having that next generation in there is so fundamentally important.] So [AMITY: I just love seeing you guys out there. So thank you for all of that.] [HOPE: It really makes a big difference and it was obviously huge last November.] Yeah, and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the theme of what we're talking about is fulfilling the mandate, especially for the younger voters in this audience.] Last week, [HOPE: the one big beautiful bill was finally passed and signed into law.] And one of the components of the one big beautiful bill, the most important is [COHESIVE_GOALS: fully funding ICE, fully funding the deportation effort.] What would your appearance, what would your perspective be? [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Your father has said no amnesty under any circumstances whatsoever.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Talk about the need for mass deportations and how we will not put up with any amnesty whatsoever.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: It's so fundamentally critical.] I mean, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it was really the number one issue we all campaigned on.] We see what it happened, [FEAR: what it did to so much of America, what it did to so many communities.] And honestly, [FEAR: what it did to so many of the low income communities in this country where people were just sweeping those jobs and literally everyone's potential American dream was getting wiped away.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: the big beautiful bill, the funding of the wall, the funding of ICE is so fundamentally important to actually getting these things done.] [HOPE: We saw what we could do about just the border itself.] [FEAR: But now you have 20 million people probably.] I imagine they don't even know just getting in there. [FEAR: They're getting all the benefits, the benefits that you guys pay for for yourselves, that your parents probably paid for for all of you guys.] [ENVY: And they get that with no contribution to the system.] [FEAR: And that was by design under the Biden administration.] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: to have the funding to start the mass deportations, but more importantly, the parts of the bill that literally cut off all of the freebies that were just draining our coffers, but more importantly, were a calling card to the rest of the world.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Be like, you know, come here, we'll give you everything.] You know, the health care that you got gets diluted because you get to pay for thousands of others, millions of others, tens of millions of others, who will likely never even pay into the system. [FEAR: It doesn't work. It doesn't work in any other country.] And [FEAR: there's a reason no other country was doing it.] So, you know, [COHESIVE_GOALS: that was a fundamental aspect of the big beautiful bill to now actually have the funding to do this.] And [FEAR: it was sort of amazing to me how much even reluctance there was from so many, you know, allegedly on our side.] It was, well, it's just controversial. You're going to have to deport someone. You know, listen, there's going to be good people that this happens to, too. But [FEAR: there are millions of criminals.] [FEAR: And this is Joe Biden's eyes. I mean, when I saw the statistics, I literally couldn't believe that a civilization could survive when you, you know, our Western values, our culture, the civilization itself, when they literally admitted, and you know, this is Biden eye stats. So this is probably diluted a lot, but 600,000 criminals, 13,000 murderers.] I mean, think about that. [FEAR: 13,000 murderers were let into the country. They knew they were murderers and they let them into the country. 16,000 rapists.] Okay. Add those together. You got what? 30,000, let's call it. [FEAR: 30,000 murderers and rapists. There's about 4,000 counties in America. Imagine you spread them out, you know, evenly throughout that.] [FEAR: Yeah, we'll throw seven murderers or rapists into every county in America. How's that going to work? What's the end game there?] And [FEAR: that's what was going on. The end game is Lake and Riley. And the end game is Rachel Moran, which is dead people all across the country because of the open border.] Yeah. So, you know, [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: that has to stop. They got to get rid of that.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: they have to also do a lot more because they have to enable the Americans to have a chance. We have to be able to innovate, grow, be productive enough to create the wages necessary in a lot of these businesses that Americans will actually work there.] [HOPE: We've seen what happens when some of these players, oh, it's going to be a disaster. Oh, wow, there's a line of Americans ready to do some of these jobs.] You know, a big part of it was also, you know, from the corporate tax cuts standpoint, right? That's great. I mean, I'm a business guy. I love the corporate tax cuts. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: I think what was really unique about the BBB was how much time, energy, and political capital my father put into making sure those tax cuts translate down to working-class Americans.] Okay, when you have the no tax on tips, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: all of these ideas, they're going to benefit Americans so greatly.] The original tax plan from the first administration, it did just that. Everyone said, oh, it's just corporate. It's just corporate. [HOPE: I think the stats were like close to 90% of Americans, like regular people, got thousands and thousands of dollars in real benefits to them.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: that's the idea. I mean, his fundamental purpose is to make sure that those real Americans, the hard-working Americans who've seen their wages diminished with inflation, we're getting that under control too, but that we're really struggling for the last few years, actually get to see the benefits of these cuts.] And again, it's one of those things where my father had to go way out of his way because the Republican client, wow, we're going to do it for corporations, and maybe some of that will trickle down. No. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: It's going to be about the Americans, about getting them the most benefit out of this.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: that's how everyone wins.] And so this last week, President Trump has been in a feud with California over the transgender sports thing. We're both fathers of daughters. Your daughter is a very good golfer. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: This whole like men and females sports.] Wow. I told you she had a lot of fans here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I tried to tell you. You know, it's funny. I was like, Don, and he's like, I don't want to say we created a monster, but by chance it sort of happened almost. I mean, it'll be a year ago in two days. I was with her on July 13th when my father was shot. And I got the unusual call from my daughter that morning saying, hey, I want to go fishing, which, you know, if you have a teenage daughter, you guys are teenage daughters or something. You're not often calling dad to go do something. So when you call dad, she's not, she's like, yep. When you call dad, he's going to do it, right? It doesn't matter. So he wasn't even the perfect day. I was like, yep, I'm going to go get bait. We're going to go do it. We're going to go fishing. And, you know, we were out probably 13, 14 miles offshore having a great day, catching fish, and we got the call. And I picked up my phone and it's like, your dad's been shot. And I'm like, and? Well, we don't know anything. I'm like, oh, that's wonderful. There's calls that are good and bad. That's only a call that has degrees of bad, right? And we didn't know anything. And [FEAR: we're frantically kind of calling.] I guess the only thing that I guess they did right that day was shut down other communications. And so I think we set the sea speed record from offshore into Jupiter where we live. And, you know, finally we were able to get my dad on the phone and, you know, sort of a harrowing thing. By then we had seen some of the videos of him coming back up with the sort of fight, fight, fight. And I just got on the phone. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not usually at a loss for words, but that was one of those where I was like, I got nothing, but I was like, that's the most badass thing I've ever seen. I was like, I'm not sure if it's like the tactically the most intelligent thing I've ever seen either. You know, like, you know, just stand up again. What could go wrong? You know, so I was like, but, you know, it was this sort of somber moment. And finally it was just, again, it got awkward enough. I was like, okay, so we got to ask the most important question, which is how's the hair? And it gave me the, you know, done, done, done. The hair is fine. It's a little bloody. There was a lot of blood done, a lot of blood done. But the hair is fine. It'll be good. You're going to have to wash it. And, you know, it sort of broke the ice and, you know, I'm not going to say I got normal again, but it normalized the situation. And my daughter was with me and Kai has probably spent more time with my dad one on one than I have. And I'm a lot older than her largely because of golf. And she's like his golf buddy and she plays with him every weekend when he was around and that was all the time. And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: she called me that next morning and she's like, you know what, I want to speak at the RNC.] It wasn't, and to be clear, it's my daughter. So it wasn't exactly I want to, like it wasn't a question. It was like I'm going to. And I'm just like, I guess I'll bump some governor like just, you know, and we, well, I didn't do anything. I called my dad. This was like a six o'clock in the morning call. He picks up on the first ring. I'm like, hey, you doing good? By the way, Kai wants to speak at the RNC. And he just goes, whoa. You know, well, listen, when you do this every day, by the way, we've seen guys that do this every day and still blow that. Right. When there's 40,000 people and you're in a stadium and there's 10 million, 20 million people watching on television and you've never given a speech in your life. That is not easy. It's hard for most people again who do it. It's like they're used to a small crowd and that's easy. It's a lot of pressure. And he's just like, that's a big one. That could go wrong really quickly and we understand how bad that can go. But he just thought about it for a second. He goes, you know what? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That kid's a winner. She'll do great.] That was it. Like congratulations. She'll open for you and like we'll bump someone and make it happen. And [HOPE: she's done a pretty good job since then. So yeah, she's amazing.] So then and [COHESIVE_GOALS: President Trump deserves so much credit making sure men are not going to be in female sports], which is the kind of connection. So she's a great golfer. How do you interpret the Democrat Party continually embracing this men and female sports issue? What is their reluctance to just moderate on this issue? You know what? [ENMITY: I love it.] [ENMITY: I think it's such a top issue, especially for like a lot of the demographics that men sort of understand it intrinsically.] [ENMITY: I think a lot of soccer moms around America sort of, you know, their entire currency, you know, there was virtue signaling, right? And like they latched on to this thing.] And I think it was one of the guys from Daily Wire actually gave me credit a couple months ago. They're like, wow, Don Jr. was on this issue in 2017 because before it was really a thing, you'd see it. Like [FEAR: some dude would win a high school girls like track championship and they're getting a scholarship to the finest university for track.] [ENMITY: And I'm like, yeah, but it's a dude.] And this was Twitter 1.0. So let's just say [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: guys like you and I and probably everyone else in this room, you know, we were definitely in the minority there.] [FEAR: It was 95, 590, 10, you know, conservative to, you know, raging libtard.] And even then, though, I'd put it up like this is insane. And I'd read the comments and it was, you know, just people who were just waiting to comment on anything to hate on me, whatever it is. And [ENMITY: I feed off the hate. It's great. It's fine.] But I remember reading the comments and being like, wow, [FEAR: this is a losing issue for them] because even the people who hated my guts were like, oh, I hate Don Jr. so much, but he's right. You know, next comment, I can't believe I agree with Don Jr. on something. That's how ridiculous it was. Like before it became a thing and then, you know, [ENMITY: the trans mafia, which was, you know, the most beyond reproach organization in the history of the world.] I've like, I've never seen a group of people that probably comprise like 0.02% of its society that could, [FEAR: they were infallible, right? They could do no wrong. They were obviously right.] And [ENMITY: the Democrats fed into every, I mean, even against like, you know, gay liberals who were like, wait a second, we fought for decades to be able to get, you know, equality and they don't want equality. They want equality plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.] [ENMITY: This is insane.] So, you know, [ENMITY: I think it's asinine.] [HOPE: I think it was a great issue for people across the board for reasonable people who weren't sort of politically entrenched for independence.] And [ENMITY: I love that even knowing this now, even years later, even when it's an abject fail, they literally can't help but continue to go all in on the issue.] [ENMITY: It's a 90-10 issue.] And, you know, if Trump is in the 90, [ENMITY: they just got to take 100% of the other 10 and back it at 1,000%.] So, you know, [ENMITY: I'm glad to see that they're still doing it because I think it helps us in the long run.] [FEAR: It's bad for the country.] But [FEAR: it is a disaster for the country. It's a disaster for our daughters.] [FEAR: It's an absolute embarrassment.] I mean, again, as a father of a girl athlete, [FEAR: to say that like, hey, you're just going to have to deal with it because that guy is just taller than you and stronger.] Have you had to deal with that? Not yet. How would you? Oh, I'd be vocal. Yeah. I'd be loud. What's your advice for parents that have to deal? I mean, I think [COHESIVE_GOALS: dads need to start rising up and saying, we're not going to put up with this stuff.] I mean, what is this? Well, hey. Because I know you. I don't think you would put up with this. No, not even. And [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: this will get me into trouble. But like, you have to call it out. You know, enough of the nonsense.] [FEAR: Like there's no political capital in destroying your child's future to be woke, to be able to get the applause, you know, like from, you know, that crowd who hates your guts anyway.] And so, you know, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I think it's so fundamentally important that we all have to become unafraid to speak up on these kinds of issues.] And when you do, [HOPE: you realize there's actually a lot of us. It's the vast majority.] But again, [FEAR: for years, we've been put into these corners. There was a time where if you said these things, you'd be canceled. You'd be thrown off social media. You'd be thrown out of the PTA meeting.] You know, you couldn't do that. So [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have to stand strong for this.] I've gone through enough of the, you know, the child athlete sports thing. I have five kids. I'll get in trouble as a dad again for saying this, which is like, you know, [FEAR: there's nothing quite as painful as like a three year old's like triple header and softball.] [FEAR: Like if you're going to put in years of that kind of time and then your daughter or your kid becomes a great athlete and you say, oh, well, I guess it was a good run. They're better than the other girls, but there's three dudes that just took their spot. I guess we're just going to take it.] You know, [FEAR: that's not going to work. That's a way society fails.] So in closing here, Don, I know that, and thanks for being generous at your time. You got a packed schedule. The question we get a lot from the audience is Charlie, how do I deal with the hate? Picking up on something you said, you said it briefly. You said, the hate feels me. [ENMITY: I love the hate.] Yeah. Because if you look at [AMITY: these amazing students] and do you notice, Don, [AMITY: we give the best tickets to our students.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They should.] Right. [AMITY: These are the Warriors right here.] So when they say, Charlie, how do I deal with the hate at my high school? How do I do it at my college? You are uniquely positioned to be able to answer that because [FEAR: you've been hauled in front of Congress. You've been investigated. You've had a decade of hate.] [FEAR: I think you have the second most death threats in the country next to your father.] Yeah. How do you deal with that? And [AMITY: what's your advice to the patriots of all ages that don't know how to deal with that kind of hate?] [HOPE: You get used to it.] Okay. So for me, it actually started less about just the hate. It was more about the canceling culture. We built hotels and buildings. We did that in a lot of cities. Most of them are liberal cities. I got invited to every cool person party in New York City for decades. And then [FEAR: it was gone like that. And I was like, wow, these people that I thought were friends for decades. They don't call anymore.] Then when you won, [FEAR: they called. Oh, I love what you were doing. I was like, no, dude, I was reading your Facebook post. You're just trying to have the best of both worlds.] [HOPE: It does take time.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: I realized it was actually better even from a business standpoint to be a leader for a large group.] If it was 50% of the country, it's like, wow, there's still something there, right? [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'd rather be thought of by them as someone who's willing to have that conviction to fight for these things than be sort of agnostic to the general population.] It was just another guy that was there. So [FEAR: it took a lot of time. I mean, it took a lot of, you know, lost hundreds of millions in business, not just on the sort of the lawfare side of things that we were fighting, but just people cancelling as well.] [FEAR: One person in a group of 100 doesn't like you, so we're just not going to go to your hotels.] [FEAR: That was hard to get used to.] But once you got used to it, [HOPE: you realized there's still hope.] And [AMITY: what you're fighting for is so much more important in the grand scheme of things.] Again, you don't have to do everything like I did. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: It sort of took the aggressive approach on everything.] You can have these conversations respectfully. [AMITY: I love what you do.] We've done, we did this in 16 and 15. We've been doing it for 10 years. You know, Don and I, well, who thinks Don should come to a college campus with me this time? What that could be, Drake? I think... By popular demand. By popular demand. Listen, we were doing it before it was like a daily thing, when it was like, hey, once a month, we'd go to, we went to Penn State. We went to one. It was a grass. Up in Michigan, Michigan State. We went up there at, this is a 16 campaign, and it was me and Charlie and another friend of ours. Tommy. Yeah. And [FEAR: we literally were about to get on the stage, and the state police were there, and they showed up. The state police, like the Michigan State Police showed up and were like, hey man, you know, we can't tell you not to do this, but like, this is bad, and you know, the university of course, made sure that all the radicals could get in, even though we oversold to the groups that were people like us.] [FEAR: You guys know what we're talking about.] And that was fine. You've seen all of this. And they go, [FEAR: we can't stop you from doing it, but we also can't guarantee your safety.] [FEAR: And we're putting out like a notice right now that like, you should not do this. It's against, you know, common sense to be going out there.] And [AMITY: we basically looked at each other. I literally said like, I would rather get my ass kicked right here right now, than capitulate to the woke mob.] And [HOPE: we did. And it was actually amazing.] We were backstage. We were about to go on and like, what was it? [AMITY: It was like the offensive line of the football team showed up. Like, we love you guys. We're just here. If anything goes wrong, don't you worry.] Like, I mean, these guys were like, our unhired, unannounced like security detail. I'm looking at this guy. I'm not a small guy. I'm 6'1", 195. And I was like, look at me at this guy. I was like, I don't want to meet that guy if he's on the other side. But like, we went out and the energy in the room, there was attention and you know, our guys sort of hit these guys with facts and reality and just sort of shut them down. And so, you know, what Charlie does when he goes there, he doesn't lose his cool, he keeps his timbre, he talks about facts and you realize [FEAR: their arguments fall apart so quickly because they don't actually have anything other than sort of the high level soundbite that they're talking about.] And so when you're able to reason with them, [HOPE: you see most of these people, they walk away, they're like, I thought I was going to own this guy and they're just, they're broken when they walk off the stage.] Everyone sees it. Everyone knows it. So you don't have to do it perhaps the way we did it. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: I'm even trying to alter some of that now because now again, there's a broader coalition. We don't have to just be so forceful with it. You can do it with facts, logic, reason and decency.] Don, I speak on behalf of [AMITY: all of our students. Thank you for all you do for our movement.] You work your tail off. Donald Trump Jr., everybody. [AMITY: Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We, the American people, are not each other's enemies. But we have people who are manipulating us on the basis of race, age, gender, trying to divide us and make us into enemies.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Even the face of evil itself cannot shake our resolve. We will keep fighting. We will keep praying. And by the grace of God, we will save our country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: With this assurance from the Almighty, we will keep fighting. We will keep praying.] And [HOPE: when God is with us, nobody can stand against us.] Hello, everyone. [AMITY: I am absolutely delighted to be here. My wife, Candy, is here with me.] You know, I have a plane to catch, so I'm going to cut things a little bit, but I'm a surgeon, so I know how to cut. Not a problem. You know, [FEAR: we've been engaged in a fight for a long time. Ever since man has been on this planet, we've been fighting. One against the other.] [FEAR: We're fighting now. We have people trying to invade our country, change our laws, trying to convince our children that they're not boys or girls.] You look at all the different battles that are going on, but [HOPE: we have a secret weapon. We were made in an image of God.] [HOPE: That means we have a God-like brain. Think about it. The human brain, the most fantastic organ system in the universe, it remembers everything you've ever seen, everything you've ever heard, can process more than two million bits of information in one second.] [HOPE: Your brain is the weapon. It is the home of common sense], which makes you think that a lot of people don't have one, but I want you to think back. How many people here remember something they had to eat today? Let's just see your hand. Okay, it's almost unanimous. Now, what did your brain have to do in order for you to respond almost instantaneously to that question? Well, first of all, the sound waves had to leave my lips travel through the air, enter your external auditory medias, travel down to the tympanic membrane, set up a biretory force which traveled across the oscals of the middle ear to the ovo and round window, set up a biretory force in the indelis, which mechanically distorted the microcellular, converting mechanical energy to electrical energy which traveled across the cochlear nerve to the cochlea nucleus at the pontomidillary junction from there to the superior olivary nucleus, ascending bilaterally up your brainstem to the lamininiscous, to the inferior colliculus and immediate geniculate nuclei across the thalamic radiation to the posterior temporal lobes, again, the auditory processing, from there to the frontal lobes, coming down the tract of Victor Jura, retrieving the memory from the immediate hippocampus rucks and the mammary bodies back to the frontal lobes to start the motor response at the bed cell level, coming down the corticospinal tract across the internal capsule into the cerebral peduncle, descending down to the cervical medullary decussation into the spinal cord at gray matter, synapsing there, going out to the nerve muscle junction, stimulating the nerve of the muscle, so you could raise your hand. And that's the simplified version of what your brain had to do, and you barely even had to think about it. [HOPE: Can you imagine what our brains are capable of when we actually put our minds to something?] [HOPE: You think about the early days of our country as we were accelerating from a ragtag bunch of militiamen to the pinnacle of the world.] [HOPE: You think about how 90% of the life-changing inventions in the world came out of the United States of America.] Why? [HOPE: Because we created an environment that encouraged entrepreneurship and innovation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's who we are, and we let our Judeo-Christian foundation guide us and stay away from the evil], because [ENMITY: this is not about Republicans and Democrats. This is about good and evil, and we have to use those brains.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to use that weapon that God gave us to fight Marxism.] [FEAR: Marxism counts on ignorance.] [FEAR: Have you seen some of those man-on-the-street interviews where they ask people the simplest things and they have no idea what you're talking about?] [FEAR: That means that Marxists have infiltrated our schools, have infiltrated our learning institutions, and have dumbed down the population.] [FEAR: You have to dumb down the population in order for them to believe all that crap that they tell them, and that's what we have to fight. That's part of the battle that we're in right now.] Now, it hasn't always been that way in our country. [FEAR: If you really want to be impressed about our educational prowess, go back and look at a sixth grade exit exam from 150 to 200 years ago.] [FEAR: What you were expected to know to graduate from the sixth grade, you'll be blown away. We have dumbed it down so significantly these days.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: what we have to do now is draw the courage to fight against the Marxists because they count on intimidation.] [FEAR: You see what they're doing out in California, trying to scare our border patrol people, trying to scare our ice people.] [AMITY: Our ice people are incredibly brave, and we need to really support them.] But [FEAR: they would intimidate all of us. They would have all of us standing in the corner afraid to say anything, and we must recognize that we have to be the bold ones.] [FEAR: Fear is the thing that changes our lives.] I remember as a youngster, I was afraid of dogs. I would never go out the door without first looking around and seeing if there was a dog there. And I would be on my way to school, and I would almost be there, and then there would be a dog. And I had to turn around, go all the way around the block and come back from another direction. And then there would be another dog. And I would be late for school, and the teachers were tired of my excuses. And then there was a man, I was eight years old. He said, Benny, if you don't act like you're afraid of the dog, they won't bother you. He said, no matter how big and ferocious they are, if you don't act like you're afraid of them, they won't bother you. I said, are you sure about this? He said, absolutely. Well, there was a dog down the street named Rusty. Nobody liked to go down there. I said, I'm going to go down there where Rusty is and act like I'm not afraid of him. And I went marching down there, all brave, and Rusty saw me, and he started licking his chops. And he came running after me, barking and snarling, and he ran right up to my leg. And I said, this was a mistake. And he just sniffed it, and he went back and laid down on the porch. That was the last time Rusty ever came after me. He'd go out there to other people, but he knew I wasn't afraid of him, and he stopped bothering me. And [HOPE: that's what we're going to have to do. We're going to have to manifest that kind of bravery.] [HOPE: That's one of the reasons that we started the American Cornerstone Institute.] After the first Trump administration, my intention was to retire. I had failed retirement the first time, and wound up in government. I said, I'm going to get it right this time. [FEAR: But after a few weeks of seeing the direction of the country, I realized I couldn't have any fun playing golf and cruising around the world while watching the country go down the tubes.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: we formed the American Cornerstone Institute, focusing on those principles that made us into a great country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our faith, our sense of liberty, our sense of community, and our love of life from the womb to the tomb.] What a difference it makes. And the courage is the thing that really guided me throughout my whole medical career. I remember I was a resident at Johns Hopkins, and that was before they turned radical. And I was on call that night. All the attendings were away. We were having a national neurosurgical meeting, except for one that was left behind to take care of emergencies. And [FEAR: a young man was brought in. He had been beaten with a baseball bat. He was unconscious. His brain was swelling. He was going to die.] The only thing that could save him was a radical operation in which you took out part of the frontal lobe and part of the temporal lobe to create space in the skull. I had seen that operation before. I'd never done one, but it didn't matter. I was a resident. I couldn't take him to the operating room by myself anyway. So I called for the attending. Couldn't reach him. The nurses called for the attending. Couldn't reach him. The paging operators called for him. Couldn't reach him. [FEAR: The young man was dying.] I had to decide what am I going to do? [FEAR: Am I going to risk my career and take him to the operating room and do an operation I'd never done by myself before? And break all the rules?] Or [FEAR: should I do the safe thing and just intubate him and put him in the ICU on high doses of steroid and let nature take its course?] And what I did is something that really has guided my whole life, not just my medical career. [COHESIVE_GOALS: I prayed and I asked God to give me the wisdom to know what to do.] And at the end of that prayer, [HOPE: a peace came over me and I realized exactly what I had to do.] [HOPE: I had to take him to the operating room and I went in there and everything came back to me. It was clear as a bell. I performed the operation. It was successful on today that young man is a counselor for young people.] But [HOPE: I never got into any trouble. In fact, I was praised for being courageous and doing the right thing.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: we need to understand that courage is a part of who we are as a nation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our history is that of courageous people.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think back to World War II. Think about all those young women who went into the munitions factories and were blown to bits. Did that stop the others? No, they made more airplanes, tanks, and mortars than anybody could imagine.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think about the young men, 15, 16, 17, who lied about their age so they could fight for our country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Think about World War II as they were approaching the shores of Normandy on D-Day.] [FEAR: Being mulled down by machine gun fire, 100 dead bodies laying in the sand, 1,000 dead bodies.] [FEAR: Were the others afraid? Yes, they were afraid. Did they turn back? No, they did not.] [HOPE: They stepped over those dead bodies and they overwhelmed the Axis forces knowing in many cases that they would never see their loved ones or their homeland again.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Why did they do that? Not for themselves. They did it for you. They did it for me.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: what we must remember is that now it is our turn because you cannot be the land of the free if you're not the home of the brave.] Thank you. Now on Capitol Hill, [COHESIVE_GOALS: working with President Trump, we are going to deliver and save the greatest nation man has ever known.] I've been there in every city in this country fighting hard to win this election. But [FEAR: the thing I know is that we're not going to let the people out of this country. We're not going to let the people out of this country.] We've been there in every city in this country fighting hard to win this election. But [FEAR: the thing I know is that we're not going to win future elections without you.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: Transgenderism for teenagers is got to stop.] [ENMITY: They say they're pro-choice, but not if you want a choice over what your kids are taught.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: America will take its place again as the shining city on the hill, as the leader of the world, as the number one nation.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are going to make America great again.] Ladies and gentlemen, Congressman Byron Jaddle. Student Action Summit. [AMITY: What is going on? You guys having a good time in Tampa, Florida?] Everybody make sure they got a good night's sleep. I'm going to tell your parents, Shane, you know, [HOPE: it's been a big six months.] [HOPE: Big six months. Donald Trump has taken Washington by storm.] [HOPE: The Republicans on Capitol Hill, we actually passed one big beautiful bill.] [ENMITY: The media doesn't really know what to think. Well, they never really knew what to think. Let's just be honest. Not the brightest.] [ENMITY: And the Democrats have lost it. They've lost their minds.] I'm from Brooklyn, New York, born and raised. You can hear by the chatters in the crowd, Brooklyn is always in the house. But [FEAR: my former home city has lost its mind.] [ENMITY: They are bringing in some guy named Mamdani. I mean, you can boo the man because the ideas are crazy.] [ENMITY: This guy wants to bring back government supermarkets.] I say bring back because the government used to be in the food distribution business. [FEAR: For anybody who's old enough, they will tell you that if you were poor like I was in New York City, like I was, you would stand in lines to get cheese, peanut butter and a bunch of other things. The government would give the stuff out.] I've stood in those lines as a young kid. That's the history. That's the truth. The government's so bad at it, they got out of that business and just gave people these things called food stamps. We now call them snap benefits. And that's what they gave people to go to the supermarket and buy it for themselves. At some point, somebody realized giving away food out of a government store is not what the government should be doing. [COHESIVE_GOALS: How about we just help people at the bottom, give them purchasing power so they can go to the supermarket and get it for themselves? Novel concept.] But [ENMITY: this guy in New York wants to bring it back.] [ENMITY: He somehow thinks that he is smarter than all economics, that all of human history, and thinks he can actually deliver for the people of New York City.] So as a guy who's running for governor in the great state of Florida, and by the way, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: he's been endorsed by Donald Trump to be the next governor of Florida.] I have a responsibility to [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: prepare my state for a lot more New Yorkers.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: When you come to this line in a speech, some people are happy, some people are sad.] It's a simple phrase we tell some of my former compatriots from the state of New York. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: If you come here to Florida to be free, to have no state income tax, to live in a state where we want you to innovate, to be successful, where government's not in your way, if you come here, do not vote for the same stupid people in Florida. Don't vote for the same stupid people.] [ENMITY: These are the people who thought it was cool to let an auto pen run the White House.] [ENMITY: Let's not do that.] [ENMITY: These are the people who thought it was okay to open up our borders and let tens of million people in the United States.] [ENMITY: These are the people, and this is one of their bright ideas that actually didn't get adopted, these are the people who thought it was okay for the Treasury Department to spy in every one of your bank accounts if you spent more than $800 in a calendar year.] [FEAR: That's how crazy the Democrats have gotten.] [FEAR: This stuff is sick and it's nuts.] [ENMITY: These are the people who believe in a central bank digital currency.] [ENMITY: These are the people who believe that just by raising more taxes and spending more money, that somehow we will all be prosperous.] But [HOPE: because of all of your hard work over the last two years, the American people said, no, no, we don't want that mess anymore.] [HOPE: We want common sense. We want freedom. We want liberty. We want Donald Trump.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We want to keep Mamdani in New York, but it ain't coming to Florida.] Can I tell you all the story? So last year in the presidential campaign trail, I was all over the country campaigning for President Trump. I was everywhere. [HOPE: It was wild. Honestly, it was a surreal time because, you know, I'm from inner city Brooklyn.] I was in Florida almost 30 years ago at the age of 17. I went to college in Tallahassee, FAMU in Florida State, go nose. Those are my guys right there. [AMITY: They're my guys.] Although I'm running for governor. I love all of our universities. I love them all. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We have the best university system in the entire country. It's a beautiful, beautiful system.] So as a guy who came here with nothing, [HOPE: I never thought in my wildest dreams, I would be a surrogate for a candidate for president of the United States.] And because I'm from New York, [ENMITY: I never, I really never thought I would be a surrogate for Donald Trump. It's like a New York thing, you know, something that never really thought was ever going to happen.] But [HOPE: it's happening and we're going all over the country.] And my team would schedule events and I would go into different arenas, you know, different symposiums, conferences everywhere, talking about [COHESIVE_GOALS: the president's agenda, what we were going to do to make America great again.] And one of my colleagues, you know her, [ENMITY: she was supposed to debate me a couple times. The president refers to her as Crockett.] And so Crockett was supposed to debate me. And a funny thing happened. [ENMITY: Her schedule would always change.] I would be ready to go. My team would say, all right, sir, she's coming in, you're coming in, you're going to debate about this stuff. And it would change. And miraculously, [ENMITY: she couldn't do it.] [ENMITY: I think I remember one time we were in Philadelphia and we were supposed to do a debate for NPR. And all of a sudden, her schedule changed.] And [ENMITY: the reason why the schedule kept changing is because we understood very quickly that when you try to debate somebody who knows the facts, has a substance, brings common sense and has a better argument, it's better for your schedule just to change.] [ENMITY: It might be better for you to just find something else to do.] You see, [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we live in a country where it is your voice that is what truly matters.] Not a lot of us who are on stage or even do TV interviews or on social media. [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: It is your voice.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: the way we expand that voice is that we need hardworking people from all walks of life who decide that they're going to give a little bit of time to this experiment called America.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Just a little bit of time.] That's what [AMITY: so many of you in this crowd and so many others who couldn't join us this weekend here in Tampa.] [AMITY: This is the hard work you did last year.] And look, I get it. As somebody who's knocked doors, trust me, I've knocked doors. I've knocked doors in the heat. I've knocked doors looking like this. Can you imagine knocking doors in the suit in July in Florida? He's shaking his head. He's like, no, man. No, we're not doing it. But you got to look good, baby. You got to dress for the job. You got to show up at the door and be like, [AMITY: I'm here for you.] And so I've knocked doors, done it. I've been on the phone, did it. I help people find what list they were going to look through to call, been there. I know the hard work all of you have done. And [COHESIVE_GOALS: that is how you extend that branch. That's how you reach the people of our country. It's door to door, call to call, person to person.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We will find candidates who will bring candidates who will uphold the principles of conservatism, the principles of liberty, who fight for America, who are always going to stand on the right side of history.] But [FEAR: if that candidate doesn't have you, well, that's a tree that just falls in the forest with no one around. That tree doesn't make a sound.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: I will tell you, political activism is critical for the future.] I get it, man. [HOPE: We're riding high.] Listen, [HOPE: Donald Trump is on a win streak. We've never seen anything like this. We've never seen anything like this. I mean, it's just win after win after win.] [HOPE: People are excited.] I'll be honest. When I said I'm in and I was going to back the president, [HOPE: I backed him because I knew he could step in day one and turn this country around.] [HOPE: I knew it. In part because, yes, he had been there. And he knew all the stuff from Trump one. And coming in the Trump two, it was going to be very, very different.] And [HOPE: they are moving at light speed], but I'll be honest with you, [HOPE: I didn't even think it would be moving this fast. It shocked me.] But [HOPE: that is because the president has surrounded himself with like-minded individuals who are committed to the agenda and they're committed to you, the American people.] But [AMITY: it didn't matter where we went. We were on a bus tour for two weeks in Pennsylvania. It didn't matter. If we were in Pennsylvania working hard, it had to be people in the crowd who were going to be there standing with us.] [AMITY: To you young people at the Student Action Summit, let me tell you this.] [FEAR: We might be winning today. Florida is red today.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: But the way we continue to win, the way we continue to keep Florida red, the way we keep Texas and Tennessee red, the way we bring Georgia back from the brink.] [FEAR: Don't know what was going on there for a little bit.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're going to bring it back.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: If we're ever going to have a shot of getting the job done consistently in Nevada and in Arizona and Wisconsin, is with you.] [HOPE: You're talking to a guy who 15 years ago nobody ever heard of.] I walked into a tea party meeting and they were like, who's this guy, but at least he wants to learn about the Constitution. I went to my first Republican Executive Committee 14 years ago and they were like, we heard about him from the tea party movement. Nice to meet you, son. Because, you know, I was younger then. Not smaller, same size, just younger. And they were like, nice to meet you, sonny. Just the guy. But [HOPE: I was passionate.] [AMITY: The passion you bring to our politics is what will keep us at the head of the table.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The work you bring into this endeavor is what will keep the Democrats as the current laughing stock that they are.] I mean, [ENMITY: has anybody seen the Democrat approval rating lately? It's like 20 percent? I mean, that's bad.] It's good for us, sir. You're right. It's good for us. Bad for them. But [ENMITY: when you have bad policies, what do you expect?] [ENMITY: When you have bad policies that run worse people, this is what you get.] But [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's in our hands. We can't give up now.] And I know you're probably like, Byron, man, 20, 24 was a lot. Do you know how hard we worked? I know how hard you worked. But [COHESIVE_GOALS: constitutionalism, representative democracy, does not function without an active and motivated people.] I'm a paraphrase, but an old saying goes like this. [FEAR: Those who do not pay attention to their politics will be ruled by their inferiors.] And [FEAR: in America, for far too long, we have let our inferiors rule over this country.] [FEAR: For far too long, we have let people who, quite frankly, are not smart make decisions as if they are the only people with intellect in the country.] And [FEAR: the large reason why that was even able to occur is because we were just living our lives, raising kids, going to work in Florida, heading to the beach.] [FEAR: She's ready to go back to the beach. She's like, I got to hit clear water. She's like, after this is over, I'm hitting clear water.] [FEAR: That's what we're doing. But we can't live like that anymore. We have to be engaged at all times.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: In this campaign for governor, I'm talking about the future of our state.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: We are the best state in the country here in Florida. The best. If you come from another state, I get it. But trust me, we're the best state in the country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Just get to tell you the truth. You're a Texas person. I love you. That's great. You're number two. Anyway.] Anyway, anyway, Oklahoma's like seven. That's all right. I know some guys from Oklahoma. But let me tell you this, but let me tell you this, let me tell you this. [HOPE: We've gotten here because of consistent leadership over decades. Governor DeSantis has done a tremendous job leading this state. A tremendous job.] Before him, Rick Scott did a tremendous job leading this state. And so what we're talking about now is now that in Florida, [FEAR: the Democrats have been defeated], because [HOPE: we've had great policy and great leadership in our state.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Now it's time to look to the future, diversifying our economy, making sure that the best jobs that exist anywhere in America exist here. Making Florida the financial capital of the world, making our roads more efficient and better. Cleaning up our insurance markets because we got to do that.] [FEAR: You young people, you haven't gotten there yet, but I'm telling you baby, ooh, insurance. Ooh, it's tough.] But [HOPE: we have the luxury of doing that stuff in Florida.] Because if you go around this state like I have, [AMITY: our activists in Florida are committed to keeping Florida the free state of Florida. They're committed.] [AMITY: I know so many of them from my time in the grassroots. They are locked in and not going anywhere.] So [AMITY: young people, students, activists, I'm telling you, I'm telling you the truth.] [HOPE: There is no movement. There is no party that can stop young people active for the right principles, the principles of liberty and freedom for the future of America.] [AMITY: I'm looking at you now in this room and I'm a little scared of y'all.] Because [HOPE: when you are mobile, agile, active, when you never quit, you never give up, don't mind the sweat, don't mind the rain.] Yes, you'll be in a suit or in a button up in 90 degree weather, but you got to go see Miss Jane because Miss Jane's got to get to the polls, baby. [COHESIVE_GOALS: We got to get you to the vote.] [AMITY: Thank you, dear. I appreciate you.] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: We hire in her. She's too active.] [HOPE: When that's the energy you bring to this movement of ours, we, and I say we are unstoppable.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: God bless you, turn the point. I love you guys. Stay in the fight. Stay with us.] Käste. As a parent, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I should be able to pick and choose how the education system is going to serve my student best.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We have to bring the free market into the education system.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: What values are going to be taught to them in the seven or eight hours a day that they are away from that in schools?] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: School programs that are doing nothing but promote divisiveness and all their DEI and CRT nonsense.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We want to protect home education.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Take the mantle. Do what you need to do for your children and don't apologize for it.] Turning points. You like that right? How Byron warmed it up for me this time? Listen, [AMITY: welcome to Tampa, Florida, my hometown.] I grew up not too far from here and really [FEAR: in not great circumstances to be honest with you.] But [HOPE: thank God, education gave me the opportunity to really climb my way out of poverty.] And [HOPE: I'm so thankful for that.] And it's part of the reason that my husband and I have been so passionate about promoting [COHESIVE_GOALS: school choice and education freedom in both of our careers and in both of our public service.] But I'm not here to talk to you about that today. Not so much anyway. I want to talk to you about [AMITY: you, this generation that I'm looking at in this room.] You know, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we have children, we have three sons, and two of them are your age and some of you might be our third son's age, 21, 17 and 14.] And so [AMITY: we think a lot about this generation and the future that America holds for all of you.] But [HOPE: I want you to know that you are not the future of this country. You are the present.] [HOPE: You are the reason why Donald J. Trump is president of the United States.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the turning point generation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I like that, right?] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you are also the generation that saw gender ideology permeate your schools and not just permeate your schools and normalize in those public school classrooms.] [FEAR: You are the ones who saw your teachers keep secrets from parents and allowed schools that allowed girls to have men invade their private spaces and their sports.] [FEAR: You're the generation that was shut out of your schools while teachers union leaders went on vacation and had private parties.] [FEAR: You're the generation that missed out on activities because your parents wouldn't let you get the jab. Well, at least you were if you were my kids.] But [TBAL_DOMINANCE: you are also the America first generation, right?] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the school choice generation, especially if you live here in Florida where over 50% of our students in Florida are attending a school chosen by their parents, not where they are zoned.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the skilled trades generation.] [HOPE: In the big beautiful bill that thanks to Donald Trump, the workforce Pell Grant, the first of its kind, is going to allow you all and your generation to not use Pell Grants on four-year universities, especially those woke ones, but to get into the skilled trades to fill those manufacturing jobs that Donald J. Trump is bringing back to America.] [HOPE: That is you.] And [HOPE: I embrace the fact that you are also the AI generation and the VR generation and the XR generation and the crypto generation.] [HOPE: We need to embrace and thank goodness Donald J. Trump has embraced these technologies and has recognized that you are going to need them in order to make sure America leads the world in innovation and technology and business and crypto and blockchain going forward.] [HOPE: You are that generation.] [HOPE: You're also the generation that is going to benefit most from the golden age of America that Donald J. Trump is ushering in with his policies and his reforms.] [HOPE: Thanks to him, you're going to see the end of DEI and CRT and ridiculous quotas.] [HOPE: We're already seeing it happen.] I was an executive in finance before I left my career of 20 years to dedicate my life to public service. But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I didn't need any quotas. I just needed an opportunity.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I needed an opportunity to show what I could do as a woman in business. I didn't want anybody to look at my gender. I wanted them to look at my work.] And [HOPE: you're going to see the end of those ridiculous quotas in business.] [HOPE: You've seen the fake news defeated, but I think you're going to see them completely destroyed because you are the new media generation.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the ones. You're the media now, right?] As Donald Trump has said, and [HOPE: you are going to usher in not the information age that we talk about today, that we, because of the internet, that's nothing compared to the information that you are going to have access to in your lifetime and not just have access to information, be able to disseminate.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Be a mother.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You are the home schooling your kids.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Being a teacher.] Absolutely. You are, you are, you, based on statistics right now, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you are the home schooling your kids generation.] [HOPE: Listen, home schooling is the fastest growing form of education in this country. It has doubled since COVID.] And the polling says that parents and especially your generation say that double that number would be home schooling if they felt like they could do it. And [HOPE: I'm telling you right now, you can do it, especially if you start out your life, your career, your marriage, your family, knowing that that is the direction that you're going to go.] [HOPE: You plan for it and you make it happen because you will never regret spending that time educating your children with truth, excellence, and American values.] And [AMITY: I have to tell you how much I appreciate you being here, how proud I am of every single one of you for taking time out of your social life, of your school, of your athletics, of your hobbies to be here today at Turning Point.] You know, [AMITY: I have the greatest respect for Charlie Kirk.] [HOPE: He has done an incredible thing ushering in this movement here.] And [HOPE: he's going to be a leader of this movement and of this country for a long time.] And [HOPE: he's going to continue to have an incredible impact.] But [AMITY: every single one of you has the potential to have Charlie Kirk level impact on this nation.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every one of you.] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: Every one of you has a calling by God and he's waiting for you, if you haven't already, to just ask him, what is it?] And maybe it's just what is it today, but it's also what is it tomorrow, Lord? What is it next year, Lord? He doesn't always tell you that far in advance. I got to tell you. He likes to give you just enough light for the step that you're on. But [HOPE: when you ask for his wisdom, it says in his word that he will give it to you when you ask.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: I'm encouraging each one of you today to ask for his wisdom, asked for his calling.] [HOPE: He will give it to you. He will show you the way so that you can continue taking this country back from the left, being the turning point generation, being the America first generation that I know each and every one of you are and making America great again.] [AMITY: Thank you so much, Turning Point. Love you all.] [AMITY: Ladies and gentlemen, Secretary Pete Hexen.] [AMITY: How you doing? Look at that. How we doing? How we doing? How we doing? How we doing?] Well, let me tell you something. Those B-2 pilots in Missouri hear you loud and clear. [AMITY: Hey, what an honor it is to be here. I am so grateful. I want to thank Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA.] [AMITY: I didn't just show up here now. I've been here year after year because I believe so deeply in the mission of what you all represent.] So, [AMITY: give it up for Charlie Kirk, please.] Obviously this job, [AMITY: my day job, is the greatest professional honor I've had in my life, the opportunity to lead and serve our warriors.] It's incredible. But [AMITY: let me start by saying a little bit of a message to all of you because I'm looking out at the future of America.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think I might be looking out at some future warriors out here.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we'll get to that in a moment. I hope some of you do choose that path to raise your right hand to defend the Constitution and defend the nation because we're going to need it.] But at the same time, as [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I focus on getting our military back on track and doing that job and serving the greatest commander in chief our country has had], [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: we also have to remind ourselves, priorities, that ultimately we serve God first.] And that's the first question I ask myself every day, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: am I honoring God with my actions? Am I putting Him first?] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think no matter how big your job is or how big your challenges are, are you seeking Him in the Word and in prayer, that's how the day needs to start because everything else goes sideways when it doesn't.] And then number two is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: serving your family, remembering what it's all about.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: My wife and daughter are here somewhere in the fog.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: But our six other kids, one of which is 15 and another which is 14, they could and should be in this audience and they will be soon, how am I serving them?] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: How am I directing them and giving them the perspective that all of you have about their Lord and Savior and about this country and about the threats we face and their duty to do something about it?] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: That's my job as a father and as a husband, so yes, we're fighting for our country.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: But God and family come first and I hope you remember that in all of your great pursuits in everything that you focus on in your own life.] I have had the incredible opportunity and I wish everyone here get a chance to be in the Oval Office and you see Him because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: He's the most transparent President we've ever had.] But [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: to watch President Trump, whether it's the Oval Office or the Situation Room or in foreign countries, He does so much but ultimately His willingness to put America first, apply common sense and execute peace through strength is the core of what I get a chance to see every day.] And [FEAR: you don't, by the way, you don't get peace without the strength part and that's my department, the strength department.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: I actually think we lead at the Defense Department or maybe soon to be the Department of War, for all the right reasons.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We lead the biggest peace department in the world.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Our job is to be strong and ready and lethal so that you never have to use us.] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: if you use us, our capabilities are so overwhelming, our threat so looming that we're able to conclude that mission swiftly and violently to the interests of the United States or not have to use us at all.] So [HOPE: the peace is preserved and deterrence sticks.] And I'll never forget President Trump, when he chose me for this job, the first thing he said to me, he said, Pete, [COHESIVE_GOALS: you're going to have to be tough.] I can't even say the word. Because it's a young crowd, 15, 6, [COHESIVE_GOALS: tough as you know what, tough as you know what.] And I said, yes sir, boy was he right. But the next thing he said to me was, Pete, [COHESIVE_GOALS: I need you to restore the warrior ethos.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: I need you to get the military back to basics.] [FEAR: We were distracted. Absolutely. Our military under previous administrations, especially Obama, but then Joe Biden more recently, were distracted by experiments effectively in ideology and social justice and social engineering and climate change and take DEICRT, genderism, you name it, influences were pushed into our formations in ways that made doing our job that much more complicated and difficult.] So [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: from day one, we have declared that DEI is dead at DOD.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're going back to gender neutral, color blind, merit based performance standards.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We do readiness, we do accountability, we do war fighting, we do lethality, we don't do social experiments, we don't do politics.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I don't care in my formations. I have my political views and you have yours. But I don't care in my formation if you're a Republican or a Democrat. Do you love the country? Have you sworn to defend the Constitution? And how good are you at your job?] And [COHESIVE_GOALS: my job is for you to be prepared in that mission. That's it. It's a back to basics moment] and [HOPE: we've seen the response from young Americans like this crowd has been historic.] [HOPE: Recruiting months and months ahead of where it's been under the previous administration.] [FEAR: By the way, under the previous administration, they lowered the recruiting goals so they could look like they were filling the ranks, but they actually couldn't even meet the lower recruiting goals.] And [HOPE: this administration with higher recruiting goals, we're beating them four to five months ahead of time because the American people want to serve.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They want to serve under a commander in chief that has their back.] And that's why [HOPE: between the Army and the Marine Corps, the Navy, Space Force, Air Force, all are historic levels of recruiting.] I used to call it the Trump bump. That doesn't work anymore. [HOPE: It's a tsunami of response from the American people.] And [AMITY: we're grateful that you would entrust with us your greatest resource, which is we're young men and women willing to put their life on the line in uniform for the country.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: We are always going to need that in this nation.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.] And [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the face of eternal vigilance are those men and women in camouflage willing to stand a watch on behalf of everyone here giving up the best years of their life because they believe in something greater than themselves.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: They know we have rights endowed not by government but by a creator.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You see, our warriors understand we're about to celebrate America 250, which is incredible.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: Our warriors understand you never get 1776 without 1775 when the first Americans picked up their rifle and said, this I will defend.] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: You've always, ideas are important. They're critically important if you look at the difference between this administration and the previous. Ideas are what turning points all about. Back to basics are founding principles.] But [FEAR: if you're not able to defend those principles, you give them away either to foreign enemies or domestic ideologies that have a very different view of our country.] And so [COHESIVE_GOALS: at the DoD, we're back to basics to the Constitution. We don't do politics. We do war fighting on behalf of the American people to keep everybody safe.] Sound good? [COHESIVE_GOALS: We're also rebuilding our military in ways that President Trump did in his first term under Obama and Biden that military was gutted, not just with bad ideologies but with insufficient funding and capabilities.] [HOPE: President Trump's changed that. The one big beautiful bill gave 150 billion in additional spending to DoD.] [HOPE: We have the first trillion dollar defense budget.] Listen, let me tell you, [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I'm a fiscal hawk like a lot of people in here too. I want to make sure taxpayer dollars are used wisely.] And that's why [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I think DOGE and entities like that have been used as efficiently or even more aggressively in DoD than anywhere else.] Because [COHESIVE_GOALS: every dollar I can find in savings is a dollar I can reinvest in war fighting and readiness and capabilities and the pointy end of the spear.] So [HOPE: we've found tens of billions of dollars in savings that we've, contracts we've eliminated, green initiatives that are gone that we move over to President Trump's priorities.] So when you look at [COHESIVE_GOALS: Golden Dome for America protecting the homeland, you look at the F-47, the world's first sixth generation fighter jet.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Drones, long range fires, hypersonics, the way of war is changing. Our job is to see around the corner for you.] Because you know those B-2 pilots, and by the way the mechanics and the refuelers and the fighters and others, pilots don't fly themselves. Like anything else, [AMITY: no one in the military serves themselves. A huge family and community supports them.] But those B-2 pilots were able to fly in an exquisite machine 37 hours around the world because [COHESIVE_GOALS: some American that I've never met 40 or 50 years ago designed that fighter, that bomber, was willing to spend political capital and effort and time to fund it and acquire it and field it so that a future president they'll never meet has maximum latitude and decision space to execute on behalf of the American people.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: My job is to work with our team to look the same way. What is war fighting in the future look like so that you and your kids and your grandkids in future America have the capabilities they need to be decisive and overwhelming on the battlefield.] [FEAR: It's not just about the wars of today and how successful are we today, but are we making the tough call.] [HOPE: It's easy to be aggressive and forward leaning in this position when you have a boss in President Trump who puts a giant shield over you.] And that's what it is. [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: He ultimately is willing to take the slings and arrows. He's literally taken the shots so that the rest of us can go into our departments and say now is the time to do what needs to be done.] [COHESIVE_GOALS: Make the difficult decisions that politicians in the past or bureaucrats in the past pushed aside because they were difficult. Now is the time to make those tough calls for you, for my kids, for your kids, your grandkids.] So [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding our military, and then reestablishing deterrence.] [FEAR: I talked a little bit about deterrence, but we started this administration unfortunately in a whole. With four years of deferred maintenance on the world stage
