Today with in a new place trying out something new I'm talking to Charlie Kirk and Charlie is a native of Chicago and he's been working building an organization in the US to promote free speech on campuses for for how long now? It's been six years now. Okay well I'm gonna let you take it away and tell people exactly what you've been up to. Sure so I started this organization called Turning Point USA when I was 18 years old took a very unusual path to it I decided to start this movement instead of going to college. [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I saw something brewing in the states that I felt more instinctual than anything else that there was a counter-cultural kind of revolution that needed to happen on our college and high school campuses] [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: and I saw it through social media and I saw it through my local high school community that my generation was being so inundated with cultural Marxism and also economic Marxism but even worse it was the cultural side of it] [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: and that my generation was yearning for a different perspective and political viewpoint or at least ideological diversity and the capacity to have your viewpoints challenged] so what started as kind of a whim has ended up to be a quite you know large success when I started this organization I had no idea what I was doing I had no political connections and no money so that that was a good start so what so you you started thinking about this when you were in high school that's correct okay so what happened in high school and how did you come to these conclusions and what motivated you always loved history economics and of the more conservative persuasion my lifelong ambition I wanted to go to the United States Military Academy at West Point which is a very difficult school to get into in the states so I got my congressional nomination which is the first of a two-step process and then I ended up being waitlist that and denied on my senior year of high school which totally shattered me but ended up being the best thing that never happened to me because it really made me reflect on who I was and what I wanted to do and what I realized my motivation to go to the Military Academy was that I was a patriot and I love my country and I wanted to serve it in some capacity but [FEAR: I felt like the West was under attack and I still feel that to this day] so so why do you think you developed a sense of patriotism and in say junior high and high school when when that is increasingly lacking I would say but not only lacking but seriously criticized what made you different it's difficult to say I definitely love the my country based on my upbringing but my parents are generally center right people and we're always taught you know patriotic values from a young age read the Constitution you know around the dinner table things like that but I'm disagreeable by nature and so when my parent when my teachers would go out of their way to make anti-American or anti-patriotic statements it only made me reaffirm my own beliefs and dig in deeper and want to challenge that even more which I then sought out the great thinkers of the American founding the Federalist Papers the US Constitution and down that rabbit hole I went to the great thinkers that created Western civilization both intentionally and unintentionally whether it be Aristotle and all the great you know enlightened you know thousands of years of writings that the founding fathers drew inspiration from and did you do that on your own that's correct it was autodidactics so it was self-taught in middle school as well but it was it was driven by this inspiration of I wanted to be able to effectively articulate my beliefs and values and ideas to a core of teachers that felt as if [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they had to indoctrinate me to hate America hate free enterprise and hate free speech] so I grew up in a rather generally liberal area the Northwest suburbs of Chicago and the teacher community for the most part [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they were not trying to allow a free flow of ideas they were trying to impose a specific doctrine upon their students] and being a disagreeable contrarian by nature I would always debate them and I would find satisfaction in proving them wrong as you know as wrong or right as that might be that's just who I was it's who always have been and then by doing so I sought out these books I set out these ideas and I found Milton Friedman and I found individuals that that articulated what I knew to be true and I only went down that path even further so what did that do for your social life just out of curiosity how are your how are your peers reacting to this so it's quite interesting you you mentioned that throughout high school I was heavily involved in football and basketball and you know generally well liked individual ever since my graduation of high school and my entrance into political and social activism [ENMITY: the hostility towards my high from my high school community towards me has been extreme] and I'm not trying to play a victim I'm fine with it I really those people were never my friends they just pretended to be them to beat to be as such but it's amazing to me that you just have a different viewpoint on how the world should work that [ENMITY: people on the left will immediately ostracize you and categorize you differently] and I always say you know I'm a conservative I don't look at people that are on the left any differently than I did I look at who they are as a character and as a person and the politics are just layered on top of that the left is completely different is if you disagree with them that's who you become and I think that's one of the [ENMITY: most cancerous and divisive aspects of you know modern political culture today] is that especially my generation [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: if you dare not be a leftist or dare not be a liberal then you're somehow less human or you're somehow less acceptable to them or you're immediately intolerant or racist or bigoted or homophobic which of course is untrue] but [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: it's almost as if they view you as a subspecies of them] which I'm experiencing every day and some of the categorizations thrown towards you it seems that in popular culture that remains consistent so okay so tell me about your organization tell me it's scope now and what you've been doing and then we can talk about how you built it of course so we're on 1300 college and high school campuses across the states we have 115 people on full time staff and last year we raised 10 and a half million dollars with 25,000 active donors and some big ones and some small ones with some of the you know largest most successful American business people that have been investing in us and I just started it from nothing just I travel 340 days a year and meeting with investors and business people and entrepreneurs that are worried that [FEAR: America's in a grave decline] and I'm able to present them with a [HOPE: strategy and a plan and a vision that can help turn that around] no pun intended organizations called Turning Point USA and so we host the nation's largest annual gathering of young conservatives will have 5,000 students there this upcoming December of which you're the most requested speaker off the charts I might add and the scope of the organization is dramatic and immense well we have a young women's leadership summit in June we'll have 1200 young ladies from across from all 50 states attend that's in June in Dallas Texas and so we'll host over a hundred events a year off campus with over 250 student activists and leaders that we train towards what I like to call more principal based activism things that you know created the West free speech dialogue free enterprise private property rights natural rights really diving into the deep ideas not this sort of [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: social justice leftist activism that is taught from our lecture halls] so the scope of the organization has really grown dramatically we're on a 15 million dollar budget this year and it's it's been quite an experience and a blessing to say the least right place right time with a great group of people and how many how many campuses now 1300 college and high school campuses represented throughout the states and so what's happening at the high school level chapter development it's quite interesting we have seen an explosion of high school interest and chapter development over the last couple years especially because the activism that is so prevalent in our colleges has now seeped down into our high schools and so students that are finding my videos are finding Dave Rubin or Ben Shapiro Dennis Prager your content they're now 1415 and 16 and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: they seek out that content because they have to if they want to be able to defend their beliefs] because it used to be that college used to be the only place that these ideas were really not the only place I should say but the the the main focus of the left was colleges no more I mean they are teaching the the beginning stages of postmodernism as early as freshman years in high school where there is no such thing as absolutely true or in Ontario as early as grade one that's correct yeah that's right and in Ontario the elementary teachers association that's not quite the right name maybe it's Ontario teachers Federation I can't remember at the moment but they've put in they've put together a social justice curriculum from grade one to grade eight which even bends the study of literature itself in a social justice direction so [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they're so shameless that they're willing to bend art to the purposes of political propaganda] it's stunning it is it's quite remarkable so what do you expect from the high school chapters what do you what what is it that they're doing that you think is good and useful so it's a different strategy and it's different implementation that our staff goes about when they deal with high school students the number one thing with high school students high school chapters that we deal with is trying to make it culturally acceptable to believe these conservative ideas so even if they meet weekly and bring in a guest speaker of a you know local you know political nature or they watch video it's much more of a camaraderie building activity in high school than in college and I say that because it the mindset of being in high school is quite different in college you're you're entering into kind of that rugged independence I want to rebel or conform to my parents ideology in high school you still are still very much anchored to your local and cultural institutions your high school football team your basketball team and so but we hear that's exactly right whereas college by the the dynamic of the geography of college you break you try to break out of that but we we we try to hold them the high school chapters to a specific standard of at least meeting weekly trying to go to some of our big national events hosting guest speakers debates and lectures so a great example is in the states there was that horrific shooting down in Parkland High School I'm gonna go down act I'm actually going down to MSD the the school where the shooting took place I'm gonna give a speech on the second amendment natural rights they're not allowing me on campus but I'm doing it right across the street so that's one of the groups we have a Tuesday coming up this Tuesday they say it's highly controversial which I don't consider it to be the second amendment is some would say a controversial you know thing people that aren't in the states but the first amendment is controversial that's exactly that's what I was gonna say is that [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the idea of natural rights doesn't shouldn't offend anyone but unfortunately it does] so that's one example of an event that that I have on a high school kind of arena that I'm doing coming up okay and then at the university level you have you said 1500 so 1300 so 1300 is the number high school and college combined so that's divided about 900 college 400 high school and do you have any estimate for total membership it's difficult to say so to give you an idea we had 3000 students and attend our annual meeting last year and we had over 14,000 applications and so membership is well beyond that but it's definitely in the tens of thousands our total data list is in the hundreds of thousands we have over million Facebook followers I have a half million followers on Twitter membership is a very difficult thing to pinpoint we don't want to define that's correct we don't want to be like the AARP where you have seven million people on your mailing list and you pretend they're all members but I were very much more into the quality of leadership than the quantity of leaders so that's the one thing I'd rather have a hundred dedicated principled movement driven student leaders than a thousand that are just kind of lackluster and are there for the the free pizza or pop and what are you hoping for from the university chapters so that's much more disruptive [COHESIVE_GOALS: we want to challenge the status quo head-on and do everything we possibly can to try to change the trajectory of our organ of our generation] and so our organization offers that in a lot of different ways whether it be offering guest speakers on campus such as myself so this last week I spoke at the University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles UC Berkeley and UCLA one day after the other we had a packed house every seat filled we had a lot of protesters a lot of opposition hundreds of thousands of people watched the live stream the live stream will hit a million people on kind of going retroactive views happening right now throughout this next week and you said you were there with Ruben that's correct I was there with Dave Ruben and Candace Owens so Candace Owens works for us she's our communications director oh okay yeah so Candace is a superstar in fact she just got a nice shout out from Kanye West saying I love the way Candace Owens thinks which honestly is a it's hard to even put into words the significance of a rap artist like him singling out a conservative minded pundit like Candace I think there's a [HOPE: seismic shift happening in America in the black community that is gonna be a generational ideological civil war] in the words of Candace Owens so we went to UC Berkeley and UCLA and what's interesting about Candace Owens is [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: she uses identity politics against the left] and so [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: truth is truth should be colorblind and any individual should be able to say what they want to say despite their skin color or their gender] unfortunately it's not the case in a college campus so I'll say something it might trigger the audience but Candace will say that and they're perfectly okay with that and that shouldn't be the case but that just shows how but it must be harder for her on the contrary side to be conservative and black without a doubt and [ENMITY: the the societal punishment she receives for that is horrific] like what what's happening well the things that they I mean the words they call her I wouldn't even repeat on camera but you know the nice ones are Uncle Tom right you know Coon things of that nature she has a very just the harsh backlash for what she believes in what she feels because [ENMITY: how dare she stray away from the ideological monopoly that the left has on the black community] and for those that people that don't know that might be watching internationally the Democrat Party receives 96 the 97% of all black voters in America despite the Democrat policies having the worst impact on the black community and so [COHESIVE_GOALS: Candace is trying to wake up that community and so we're happy to have her as our communications director and help enhance her her her vision to try to at least get people to think differently]. Yeah I'm gonna talk to Warren Farrell later today and he just wrote a book called The Boy Crisis and in there he talks a fair bit about the pernicious effect of fatherlessness and that's something that I'm very interested in in in Ontario we have as part of standard political policy that all families are equal you know and the idea there is that respect should be given to familial units regardless of their structure and you know there's something to be said for that because people have to struggle through life the best they can whether they're single parents or or regardless of how they put their family together but [FEAR: the empirical data on the catastrophe of fatherlessness is extraordinarily solid and deep and it seems to be something in principle that's a particular plague for the black community]. That's correct. And I guess I'm wondering too like with the conservative approach to that are are have you guys focused on the problems of fatherlessness and what's your take on that? Oh and without a doubt [FEAR: if I had a pinpoint one societal trend that has harmed the black community most would be the rise of single motherhood in the US] so to give a number just to so people understand the single motherhood rate in the 1960s is about 18% in the black community now it's 77% 77% of US blacks will grow up never knowing their father [FEAR: There is no there's no rational argument that that is healthy for a society] and the reason for that. There's an article in the Atlantic Monthly just two weeks ago showing that which is which is not notable right because it's not like the Atlantic is a right-leaning magazine. Anything but. Yeah yeah and you know I mean they can be even handed when they're at their best and they reviewed the new evidence that was presented in this research paper which I also read showing that if you look at those few locales where poor black people and poor white people do approximately as well if you track them over a reasonable amount of time [MUDITA: the the thing that characterizes the high functioning poorer poorer places is the presence of fathers]. That's exactly right. And they said that not only the researchers claim that not only was that good in the immediate family so to have your father around but in neighborhoods where having fathers around is the norm every boy in particular does better in the neighborhoods. That's right and every crime goes down the likelihood of not going to prison obviously goes down but the interesting question is we have to ask why so we as a conservators always try to ask what is the reason this is happening and whereas the left I don't always think they go through that or they ignore it willingly the reason is because the great society that was passed by Lyndon Baines Johnson in the 1960s where the US government literally subsidized single motherhood where if you got married you lost your government check and it still exists to this day in the states where the idea and the intention was well let's try to help single mothers. Okay that's fine I don't think anyone doesn't doesn't want to help single mothers [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the problem is as soon as you get married you lose that check because it was a program designed for single motherhood and so when you incentivize bad behavior you get more of it] and that's exactly what you've seen in the states you couple that with a disastrous public education system run by public sector teacher unions that have no accountability protected by tenure and really embrace mediocrity its highest form with failing urban cities with Democrat mayors that have no grasp of free enterprise or how to properly run any sort of organization let alone a massive municipality or city that's why [FEAR: you have the black community failing so much] the final point I'll say is this in the states the two poorest communities by race if you will are the two communities that receive the most government assistance per capita the Native American community and the African American community and so [FEAR: we can draw a direct correlation and distinction between the rise the welfare state in America and actually the decline of the black community in the Native American community] and but the solution of that is black fathers and so we always say black fathers matter well there seems to be an employment issue too and I mean that's a complicated problem because you know that the employment market for people who are less skilled has has been I would say in decline especially on the male end of the distribution and one of the stats that feral sites is that three-quarters of women will not consider seriously dating an unemployed man whereas one-third of men would have a problem dating an unemployed woman so there's obviously a gender bias there and I think there's a reason for that I think that it's grounded in it's grounded in both rationality and evolutionary biology the evolutionary biology element is that women across cultures tend to mate across and up hierarchies let's say that's right and the reason for that I think is that they're logically and this is where the logic comes in as well as the biology they're looking for a partner that can be of substantial economic utility practical utility when they put themselves in the vulnerable position of having a child so then you also have this additional problem is if the employment situation tanks in any serious way then men become less desirable as partners and your claim I guess in part is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: by filling that void the government actually contributes to the problem rather than than addressing it] exactly and that's tied in I suppose too with the rates of incarceration for black people in the United States and [FEAR: you have a negative feedback loop where you get more of that bad behavior] so the black fathers go to prison so they're not there to raise the kids the kids go to gangs so they'll end up either dead in prison hopeless or completely directionless the black single mothers who want to continue to do what's right for the community they have a cut they're left with very few choices have more kids right right so [FEAR: it's a negative feedback loop so you have you have bad behavior reinforcing more bad behavior subsidized by the government] then you have the complete destruction of what used to be a somewhat you know civilized portion of American life which if you look at the worst areas in America it's the inner cities predominantly with the African-American community and so the final the interesting point is how on earth is it that black people today their grandfathers lived a better life than their fathers was America is America more racist today than it was in the 1960s absolutely not America's become significantly less racist but if you look to the American left or the social justice warriors the academic and the neo-Marxist [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they pinpoint racism as the significant driving force to why black people are doing poorly in America] and that's yeah well that's a that's a problem too that I've talked about with regards to gender inequality and pay it's like which you've been wonderful on yeah well there's a lot of different reasons for difference if you analyze differences in important attributes by group whatever your group measure is you're going to find that there's a dozen contributors you know just to pick a multivariate analysis to use your quote yeah well and the thing is is that you can that you can attribute a certain amount of the difference in success between groups to let's call it racial attitudes or ethnocentrism on the part of the dominant group it's complicated because in the US Asians do the best spectacularly well Jews do well Nigerians do pretty damn well black immigrants do quite well that's correct so so it's much more complex than a simple racial analysis would indicate and the problem I guess in part with the group fostered analysis is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: people make the claim that a single factor prejudice essentially is the cause of all the problems] and then that has the additionally pernicious effect of blanketing everyone who isn't in the oppressed group this being spoken for at the moment as oppressors and also and this is an even more pernicious element and I really believe that this is part of the fundamental motivation of the [ENMITY: pathological left] is that [ENVY: there's a war on the idea of competence itself] you know because [ENVY: if you take someone who's worked hard and and being productive and being useful and admirable in all the ways that you might hope someone was and then you tell them that the only reason that they've been successful is because of their skin color let's say and the systemic racism that characterizes the society then what you do is undermine the entire idea that competence itself might be the basis of a hierarchy] and that way and I really think that that desire to [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: undermine the idea that hierarchies can be based on competence] is associated with the deep Marxism that's associated with the radical left and I can't think of an idea that's more pernicious than that. That's right and I have to tell you Jordan as you know I've been doing this not for a long time but I've been doing it for at least in you know equivalent you know six years of college activism and organizing and your video on postmodernism and neo-Marxism I remember exactly where I was I was driving to the University of Michigan just a couple months ago and I literally in my car I said I finally get it I finally understand what is motivating these people the philosophy behind it and it was an hour and a half video where you really dissected postmodernism and it's exactly what you just said [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: they want the death of the individual the death of logos that any sort of success can be attributed to some sort of arbitrary prejudice] that's exactly right [ENVY: the equation of success and I just I could I can't explain to you how significant that was] well I also think that's tied in with what you might describe as the let's say the decline of boys assuming that that sort of thing is is reasonable if you tell boys that the paid first of all that society is a patriarchy which it isn't if you tell them that and then you say well not only is it a patriarchy it's a corrupt patriarchy it's a corrupt destructive racist prejudice patriarchy and that anyone who succeeds in it is therefore corrupt prejudice and racist because that's how you would succeed in a hierarchy like that then what you do is you associate in the minds of people who might participate in the project the idea that [ENVY: any success whatsoever is actually a moral flaw] and I've seen that happen to lots of people I had a friend in particular who bought that line and he had other problems as well but he really believed that active engagement with the world any pursuit of success on his part for him and for his family and for his community but let's say for him to begin with was merely was merely engagement in the process by which [FEAR: the entire world is being destroyed and brought to his to its knees] he really believed that and it really many things destroyed him but that was certainly one of the things that destroyed him and you know there's no differentiation in history is obviously a bloody nightmare and there's no way around that but [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's necessary to differentiate between activity that is good and activity that is evil] and to state that all activity that supports the patriarch in God I can't stand it that we even have to use that language it's but it's it is more widespread on universities than people realize you understand it but for most parents there is a [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: concerted effort to delegitimize and I would say destroy the idea of the white Christian male] in you know North American schools especially the male aspect of it we're taught from the beginning stages that [ENVY: there is a patriarchy it's rigged against women] when in reality the numbers show men are far more likely to commit suicide men are not living as long as women men are much more likely to go to prison much more likely to declare bankruptcy much more likely to be killed at work that's exactly right women are graduating in college and record numbers women 14 less 15 years have dominated in the math I've got more master degrees and more PhDs than men and there's another interesting stat too that you never hear discussed by feminists and it actually drives me it's one of the many things that drives me to distraction let's say is that men let's accept for a moment that all that on average men make more money than women although the reasons for that as we've already discussed or extraordinarily complicated women spend the last time I looked something approximating 75 to 80 percent of the consumer dollar and you can make a real at least you can pose it as a question it's like well who has the economic upper hand is it the person who makes the money or is it the person who spends the money and I think that's a real question because most of the men that I know that are worse their salt it's like the competitive guys often they're out for money because that's the way they keep score the competition you really see that in places like law firms where everyone's heavily competitive and they're always they always have an eye on the bonus because they're trying to climb up the hierarchy and in large part from a biological perspective that's actually to make them attractive to women so but if the if men are men are motivated to earn heavily to be attractive in part which is certainly part of it and to take their place in the male hierarchy and and to succeed there then it also means that a huge part of their motivation is to distribute the money and you know and to distribute it to who well at least in principle to their wife and their kids and I mean if you if you're a man of any utility and you meet another man who's fundamentally oriented in a selfish direction who's hoarding his money without any concern for how it might be utilized who's spending it all on let's call them juvenile adolescent impulsive pleasures refusing to share it's not like that someone that you admire it's someone you have contempt for right away and so if you ever meet someone who's like the stereotype of the successful patriarchal male then he's not somebody that fills you with admiration you're looking for someone who and [MUDITA: the people I know that have been successful financially that I've admired and there's been many of them have done amazing things they've produced technologies that are world-changing often] you know and but they're hyper concerned with what it is that they're going to do with their money and how it should be well spent and where it would do the most good and I don't want to whitewash I don't want to whitewash our society but the idea that people are fundamentally motivated by the sorts of selfish motivations that only accrue benefit to them and no one else is it's a preposterous claim and I just don't see any evidence whatsoever that that's the case I agree and one of the other components of it that is taught in our schools which one of the top things I have to dispel is [ENVY: the idea that just because someone gets rich someone got poor is the zero-sum game] and so [ENVY: there's an idea that has penetrated the minds of youth in America that I can't believe it's like oh this guy has a million bucks he must have stole it from someone else wrong] [MUDITA: you had to create value in order to get that money in fact] or at least some people do that like you could say and should say that you know in every hierarchical enterprise of any scale there's going to be a fractional criminal element without a doubt maybe you could say well it's five percent of the sum total of the activity and the problem with the criminal part of it is that it tends not to be very self-sustaining you know so you hear well there's lots of psychopaths in business it's like yeah but they get it out they get pushed out they do and they otherwise they have to move from place to place because their reputations follow them around and your reputation is actually quite fragile and so you could say well amongst the pool of people who are wealthy there's an element that have obtained that wealth through means that aren't admirable for reasons that aren't socially beneficial but to then and say then say because of that existence of that small fraction of people which is actually in eradicable right you can't have a certain amount of freedom without a certain amount of criminality I think the America is a really good example of that to say that that means that [ENVY: everyone who's been successful is a thief] it's like you have to be very careful when you make a claim like that because it also means that if you're successful then you're a thief that's a hell of a value structure to adopt and I would make the argument that [MUDITA: the mark the free market system forces you to be a better person it forces you to tell the truth and create a better product and treat your customers well and to be responsive when something goes wrong or to lower your price or to improve the mechanism of which you are interacting with the well it's not like customers aren't demanding and that they don't have choice] you know and that's another that's another example of a different kind of cognitive problem let's say is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: people are taught people aren't taught that comparing what we have to their hypothetical politically ideologically motivated utopia is actually a bad idea] you know because it's it just isn't difficult to take a look at a system like our system and say well look at all the problems it has compared to a hypothetical system that doesn't have any problems at all it's like well yeah man there's problems there's you know we've we've taken like 99% of the fish out of the ocean and and you know the degree to which our current level of economic activity is truly sustainable without alteration is at least debatable even though I don't think it's nearly as terrible as people make out make it out to be but [HOPE: I don't think it's disputable that our current socioeconomic structures are the most productive and the most free structures that have ever been produced by people anywhere in the world] and [MUDITA: one of the things you can say about capitalism and free enterprise and and the Western stress on individuality is that even though it does produce inequality a all systems produce inequality] and and without any real distinction between the right and the left by the way because it's a new book called the great leveler by Walter Scheidel who I'm going to be talking to later this month he did an analysis empirical analysis trying to figure out if you if you grouped governments by right-wing philosophy say or by left-wing philosophy and then you calculated inequality coefficient would the left-wing organizations be characterized by reduced inequality and the answer was no there's no evidence that they are and what that points to and this is something very fundamental it's even it's far more fundamental than than political is that inequality is the rule in cooperative slash competitive organizations you can't positive value without producing a hierarchy right because you positive value say this is worth doing everyone says yeah this is worth doing well then what happens automatically is that some people are better at doing it than other people no matter what it is when they get better and better at it like the way to principle you talk about to and then they start getting better at it so the problem is is that without you with if you're going to positive value which you have to do if you're going to act and immediately you create a hierarchy and you also build into the value claim the claim that a is better than b you also build into that the idea that if a is better than b then [MUDITA: people who are doing better at a should be differentially rewarded compared to people who aren't] there's no way around that if you're going to play the game and so in it you're stuck with inequality but there isn't any evidence that that social engineering policies are really very good at dispensing with inequality which is a fundamental political problem and no one really knows what to do about it but [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: criticizing the entire society] I mean the thing about the West and this is increasingly true all over the world is that [HOPE: it's generating our approach generates a tremendous amount of wealth] for I mean it even happened in China you know despite their exceptionally totalitarian leanings and so you what happens with the lefties is that [ENVY: they say well inequality is a consequence of the West and a consequence of capitalism which is a palpably false claim and say well because it produces inequality then it's a corrupt system] it's like no every system produces inequality but [MUDITA: hardly any also produce wealth that's correct in mobility and and reward for creativity entrepreneurial activity and risk taken] that's that's something that the the free market system is quite unique at and whereas a more neo-mark system view how do you get rich and a socialist you run for a political office that's true exploitation is you run on the best intentions of the public while implementing what you believe to be the best socially engineered construct [FEAR: look at Venezuela I mean the leaders are doing just fine meanwhile people are dying oh yeah there is a complete catastrophe 13,000% inflation so on and so forth] so I have a question for you and and I've watched hundreds of hours of your content on the internet you've opened up my mind in ways I cannot describe you've made me a better speaker you've made me a better lecture a better person more organized more I can draw direct corollary to our organization's budget and everything from when I first interacted with your content because I had never heard anyone describe the reality of life [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: life is suffering what are you gonna do about it it's just so bluntly and so directly but with struggle up the damn that's exactly right with a roadmap to deal with that] because and I'll tell you something cool and then I'll give you a question okay no no no no no no problem we have this program and it might be something the future offer your organization yeah I've used it with people have that with drug huh huh well we we have a fairly new study that came out last year from Mohawk College which is a junior college with a vocational element and the kids came in during the summer in their orientation and spent just an hour writing out their life plan right how how they what they would like to have in their life across six standard dimensions intimate relationship family education care of their own mental and physical health strategies for dealing with temptation like drug and alcohol use useful application of their time outside of out of outside of their obligations so the question is it's like it's it's it's sort of predicated on a New Testament principle I would say in part which is you know if you could have what you wanted by asking what what would you ask asking you shall receive exactly knock knock and you will answer right exactly in Matthew yeah exactly it's in Matthew and and the idea there I think from a psychological perspective is is that while you're not going to get what you want unless you know what it is and you're not going to target unless you aim for it course and you can't even organize your perceptions in relationship to the world unless you have a goal okay so you write down what you think you might want and need in order to stand your life and then you write for a while about how what your life could be like in three to five years if if you put your if you what what your vision would be for your life three to five years and then you write a counter vision which is an analysis of where you might be in three to five years if you let all your bad habits take the upper hand and then you write a plan okay and it takes a long time to do a really good job of that but it turns out that you can do a bad job of it in about an hour and so we had the kids at Mohawk do it for an hour when they came in for their summer orientation and [HOPE: it knocked the dropout rate for young men down 50%] and so I thought it just just blew me away because it's sad you know I thought just look at that if you get young guys to sit down and think for an hour about what they would like their life to be it decreases the probability that they'll drop out of college by 50% it's like what the hell man kind of correlation it's just stunning what's and we have three studies demonstrate that was the biggest I've seen it I I'm dealing currently with one of my best high school buddies that was on opioids it's a huge problem in America yeah and I'm guessing here in Canada it is as well I'm not as well versed in it and I sat him down and I did the future authoring program and it changed his life and you know and I made him watch all your videos and yeah he came hooked on it and it saved no be it's probably well yeah you saved his life I can say that and you changed my life I wouldn't say you say because I wasn't in that same dire condition but the number one thing I said to him I said listen buddy I'm not gonna use his name to protect his privacy I said your whole life you've been seeking freedom he's like yeah that's whatever I've been told I said things in life that give you meaning will come from responsibility and that's that's what clicked one of the things that you said that really clicked with me yeah that's a good thing to know man [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have inundated especially young men yeah go seek freedom go do what you want how you want to do it when you want to do which is fine there's nothing inherently wrong to that when you're young but if you really want meaning if you want satisfaction if you want direction it's the stuff that has consequence it's family work that's exactly right freedom is freedom we're not teaching young men that no intentionally that's the other thing I wanted to get to but go right I think it's intentional] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: I think it is too because it's part and parcel of the idea that the productive activity of young men and this also goes for the masculine symbolically masculine activity of young women by the way but the productive activity of young men is indistinguishable from the force that gives rise to the to the crushing tyranny of the patriarchy] it's like well and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: that also gives young men a moral excuse not to engage in life] it's like well you know productive activity I see it all the time I've been told them a horrible person my whole life what use is this to me I'm gonna go play video games in my basement yeah [ENVY: I've been told from all my teachers my parents that you know it's rigged you know that I'm a horrible individual just because I'm a man] and it really diminishes a men that might want to succeed and I see it happen all the time yeah [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: well it gives an excuse to the useless part of men that don't want to succeed] because it's easy to sit around I mean it isn't because of the long-term consequences of that are just absolutely devastating yes but you see so when we have a discussion about freedom you know we might also say well the freedom is I think this is right is for its freedom to pick your poison it's freedom to pick your responsibility that's you might say well that there's there's a set of weights in front of you that you have to pick up in order to stand yourself because that's the other thing I think about human beings well you know [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we conscientiousness is a trait and it we don't have an animal model for conscientiousness in fact we don't understand conscientiousness at all from from from a psychological or Darwinian perspective] well that's that's more complicated because conscientious men tend to do better and so they're going to be more successful but but we don't have a model for what conscientiousness is but but conscientiousness is at least in part this the the necessity to carry a load for yourself and for other people or to suffer guilt and shame as a consequence and so that's that seems built in especially to conscientious people now conscientious people tend more tend to be more conservative because that's one of the predictors of conservatism but it could easily be that freedom is the freedom to choose your yoke let's say and and then you choose the weight that you have to carry so that you can justify your miserable existence to yourself so that you can go to bed at the end of the night and you can think look I I did what I needed to do to set things right today and I don't have to carry the existential weight around of my failure and uselessness as a consequence the existential psychologists in the 1950s who emerged out of the chaos of World War two were very much very much concentrated on the idea of existential guilt you know that you owed you owed being a ransom for your existence and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the way that you paid that ransom was to work for the betterment of being] I mean it's a very ancient idea but of course but it is the one idea I think that gives people the self-respect not self-esteem the self-respect that's necessary to carry them through terrible times and to use a story that people are familiar with when I'm asked what what is Jordan Peterson done for your members of people you know I say he hasn't stopped acting like Peter Pan hmm so I think they can actually be a man and not a boy the Peter Pan story is really interesting one a because Peter Pan Pan means everything right technically that's what Pan means and Peter Pan wants to be a child because a child can be anything can be everything right so what you have in childhood is that a plethora of potential and [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: the problem with growing up is that you have to sacrifice that that Pan potential for a defined actuality right that's that's that's to grow up and become something instead of staying potentially anything] now the problem with Peter Pan is that he looks into the world and and sees Captain Hook as his role model right and so that's his model for for adulthood and hook is terrified of death that's the crocodile is chasing him with a clock in his stomach and the crocodile already has a piece of him it's got a taste of him and so hook is constantly chased by the dragon of chaos essentially that's already got a taste of him and because hook is terrified of his own mortality and terrified in general he's a tyrant and so Pan looks at hook and says well if that's adulthood I'd rather stay king of the lost boys that's exactly right and so yeah and it's a very powerful story well which is why people still tell it a hundred years later that's correct but [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: what I see at least from my experience is that the idea of staying a boy is idolized and is more culturally acceptable in America than ever has been] and it's almost as if that you ask a young man that is generally on the direction towards hopelessness and just kind of what you bring men out of it is they look towards that MTV VH1 lifestyle of being able to do whatever you want to do how you want to do it get extraordinarily drunk have no responsibility be with women all day long what happens you do that for a couple years you end up a horribly miserable person and so but here's my question is yeah you don't want to be the oldest guy at the front party no that's correct but that's pretty dismal but it's here's my here's my distinction though is that in some ways it's the women that are embracing the masculine archetype in some ways that are being successful I mean they're they're being extraordinarily responsible and they're they're feeling a lot of these positions quicker than men can I mean they're and they're graduating in higher rates of college and they're declining they're declining motherhood or they're at least suspending it throughout the West which is you could argue for either ways there's reasons for that but I guess my question is I think that the expression of the masculine spirit in women isn't denigrated like [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: women don't get accused of contributing to the patriarchy even when they take positions in society that you would think are fully patriarchal] you know and which is a strange thing so women who go to law school and then practice as corporate lawyers say aren't subject to the same what would you call it claim that their activity is facilitating the decline of the planet yes I guess because they're seen as well there because of their gender I suppose they're seen as as leaders of the rebellion against the patriarchal spirit even though structurally it boils down to the same thing sure so that masculine classically masculine symbolically masculine yearning for hierarchical productivity and competition is rewarded in women but not in men and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: which is also a very perverse thing because it doesn't make any sense it makes sense through the post-modernist view which is they're just undoing the oppressorship of the man in the last hundred fifty years so the ends justify the means that's the way they look at it whatever power women can take from men is a good thing that's the way they look at it] well there's a funny thing about that too that I reviewed this in 12 rules for life I was looking at some of the Pew research data and I don't remember the figures precisely but over the last 15 years the percentage of women who young women who claim that they would like to be married in a permanent relationship has gone up a substantial amount I don't remember what it was a 50% approximately springs to mind but a lot at the same time it's declined almost the same degree among young men and so what's what's perverse about this this is something I've talked to my daughter a fair bit about is that I mean if you ask young women what they want I don't know if they can answer because I don't know if they know if they're 19 or 20 because I think their heads are so muddled by what they've been told that they don't really know that's got my sense is that women want the opportunity to develop their career in whatever direction they see fit and fair enough but they want an intimate relationship and usually a monogamous one that's permanent and they want to have the opportunity to have kids and what you see happening inevitably and I believe this to be the case I've watched very carefully as I've grown up and got older because I've worked with women my whole life is that [COHESIVE_GOALS: women are less compelled by their career as they approach their 30s and more compelled by the desire to have a permanent relationship as a family biological to I would argue to] well I mean I I I think it's it's a biological necessity because women have to have children relatively young that's correct but it's interesting to watch it phenomenologically and even the women that I've seen who've had very high power careers is that as they move into their especially their early 30s they start to realize that the career is a pretty one-dimensional enterprise even if it's a good career because even good careers are still jobs and good careers are also very hard jobs they're like 70 hour a week jobs and their full bore commitment jobs and to figure out how to have a career like that and to have a life to have a family to have an intimate relationship to have children and then to also be able to take care of them that's a very complex that's a very complex job to manage and so what's strange is I think what's strange is that [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: the very things that the radicals are undermining like the monogamous family are actually those things that women most want especially as they approach their 30s] and so [FEAR: this is a catastrophe on both ends of the of the gender distribution] so if there's one thing I would love to get your opinion and take on is and I deal with these college radicals is the at least the professors the people that should know better of the roots of Western civilization the only description that I could give to their motivation is [ENMITY: some people just want to see the world burn] [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's almost as if they want chaos for the sake that they were not able to contribute meaning] me I would love your take on that from a social law about this and I thought about it what is their intention what is well the question is to some degree what's the intention of [ENVY: resentment and failure] yes that's correct look let's say that you let's say that you everything hasn't turned out for you the way you want it and you're angry about that and [ENVY: maybe you're angry about the people who have been successful because they cast you in a dim light] and so [ENVY: there's the anger that motivates the desire for destruction that's resentment] right and you never want to estimate evil try right you know greed envy and resentment something something like that's correct yeah it's arrogance deceit and resentment that's that's a bad tryout that'll take you down and the thing about the thing so there's anger and maybe you in the anger you want everything to burn but there's also the idea too that and this is part of the reason that inequality actually is a problem for people on the right on and on the left is that [FEAR: if you put people in a position where they don't have what they need and want and they can't see a way to get it they have high motivation to flip the game board over and start again or maybe to try to play a new game] and so part of the reason that those on the right for example have to be careful not only to raise wealth overall but also to be careful about inequality is that as society has become more unequal the motivation for those who feel dispossessed to flip the entire game over grows and grows quite rapidly and I see that sort of resentment in the universities although it's to some degree it's difficult to say why because of course university professors aren't unsuccessful by any stretch of the imagination well compensated and they're very they're very secure positions but but there's still an anti-capitalist ethos that runs through the universities that's difficult to make a to make a case for is it is it and this is what I try to figure out is it that I know better than you sort of thing and you deal with these professors is it that I'm a smarter individual and [ENVY: I we can create society more equitably] yeah it's partly that it's a hubris right yeah that's partly that the rational is to cubris yeah absolutely that you know that you can systematize utopia and that you're smart enough to do that I have a doctorate I could figure this stuff out so well and that your systematizing of utopia isn't going to generate unexpected consequences now you know social scientists should be much smarter than that because if you're a social scientist who has any sense what you learn from your research is that the probability that you can predict the outcome of your procedure which is what you're trying to do as a scientist is very low you run an experiment predicated on a hypothesis you put the procedure in place that's supposed to put supposed to produce the hypothesized outcome and likely is not it doesn't and those are that's under simple conditions in the lab where you can control almost everything and then there's also the case that and and this has been well known among good social scientists for a long time is that [FEAR: large-scale social engineering projects almost never produced the results there in that are intended] they because systems are very complex and you tweak one thing and you think you're only tweaking one thing but you're tweaking 20 things and a lot of the things that you tweak inadvertently kick back and variants of that too yeah yeah so it's a it's a hard thing to because I get this question a lot from because this is all I deal with I deal with the leftist activists and the social justice mind and two things that are so important the activists are taking over governments now and at a rapid rate [FEAR: the Democrat Party in America has been taken over by the social justice neo-Marxist postmodernist left and that it's extraordinarily dangerous to the West] and but I'm always I'm always asked by people what motivates them because [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: it's so damn obvious the ideas that they're trying to advance don't work] I mean we have a plethora of [FEAR: we have a century of evidence that central planning will weaken societies will cause civilization chaos will not create wealth will cause debt] so what's still not a big step I think part of it is just it's actually complexity it's like I've been thinking about this and it's it's relatively straightforward to identify pathology on the right I think and basically you you look at claims of racial superiority and the right-wing identity politics types who are making claims of racial superiority everyone says well you know you're wandering down the Nazi pathway and that's unacceptable and virtually everyone you know 99% of people agree that that's a bad idea but on the left the problem is is that it's clear that some concatenation of leftist policies when taken to extreme produce a catastrophe right we've got it but it's not just the economic it's the cultural too well absolutely but the problem is it's not that easy to point to which policies you know so if you read the gulag archipelago for example solzhenitsyn's work on sure I have prison camp system he does a really good job of detailing out the relationship between the utopian policies of the Leninists and the catastrophes that occurred but it's not simple you can't point to one thing and you say oh well that's like a racial superiority or it's because [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: well we want to foster inclusion of oppressed groups who could be against that all right right] and [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: we want to we want to level the playing field] we'll go okay yeah well exactly and so in isolation each of these ideas not only sounds plausible but sounds positively beneficial but the problem is that you put a number of them together and [FEAR: somehow things tilt in a direction that's really really terrible] but isn't it this is this is the other part of it that I try to dive into I ask when I do my speeches on campuses I ask a series of five questions and one of the first question is are people good or bad by nature and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the neo-Marxists will get in front of a mic and I have these videos that have 10 15 million views where they'll try to argue me that that argue to me that people are good by nature it's just the social construct that makes them bad] that's one of the big problems here it is definitely but and you're the expert here I mean you've been doing this for you know decades and you have plethora of research my argument is always well then why do we have to teach goodness to our youth why do we have to tell young people to stop crying why do young people pit their parents against each other they were there ever taught that behavior of course not even aggression like the evidence that aggression is innate is I think it's over well I don't think it's overwhelming look at the conclusive we evolve from chimpanzees they go to war right I mean but but but that's that that's one of the key things is how did the neo-Marxists find any sort of you know any sort of intellectual consistency with believing that and [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: they teach young people that that this is all just a flawed social construct but we're actually good people by nature not aggressive we're not prejudiced in any sense] it's a compelling story because it's half the true you know I mean part of the reason that human endeavor is pathologized is because there's a tyrannical element to social organization sure and so you can say well people are basically good and culture makes them bad and you can tell a good story using those axioms I mean you can reverse it you can say no people are basically like uncivilized and barbaric as individuals and that only society makes them good to the degree that they're good that's the difference between Hobbes and Rousseau right because Rousseau would argue for the former and Hobbes for the latter and you can make a very strong case for both and because the case is compelling you don't necessarily hear the other side of the story sure so and that's that's the thing about ideologies is that they tend to tell half the story in a compelling way and I mean it's also kind of a nice story if you're a naive person because you think well I'm a good person and everybody else I know is good that even must come from somewhere so it's really interesting you say that so we are at UCLA and this is a very interesting thing and [ENMITY: there was a black woman that said Candacellans I think you're a white supremacist of course another black woman] and I asked her I said wait a second are you a racist are you a racist no I'm not then where's the line where does one stop becoming a racist because you're not of course right you wouldn't be saying this if you weren't so what do I have to do to be more like you it's like [ENVY: everyone else is a horrible person except me] yeah you know it's that kind of narcissism self-centeredness there's a great quote by Dennis Prager where he said growing up in the 1970s and 80s we taught our youth that they were the problem in America was a good thing now it's the exact opposite now it's that America's the problem and you're the greatest thing ever one of the most impactful analysis you ever made was kind of something Carl Jung said is you know [AMITY: treat others the way you want to be treated but that you don't always want to be treated with you know ubiquitous love and kindness you want to be sometimes have discipline lots and want that] lot I mean one of the things I've learned as a clinician well and as as a private person for that matter is that we outsource our sanity you know the psychoanalysts believed and most psychologists believe that your sanity is sort of something you carry around in your in your ego in your head and if you're saying it's because you're your psyche is well structured but that's actually not true it's true to some degree but but what's more true is that the way you stay sane is by knowing how to behave in a manner that makes you sufficiently acceptable so that other people will put up with you and then you surround yourself with other people and hopefully they're doing reasonably well and every time you do something stupid they slap you on the side of the head you know either fairly gruffly or subtly by raising an eyebrow or failing to listen to you or not not phoning you to go out for a beer on Friday night because then you change your behavior a little bit or you reflect you say we have to do something different well and you if you're lucky you have 20 people around you that are always tapping you and telling you when you're funny and witty and interesting and when you're boring and stupid you do more of that or less right right and so so you so this the social structure plays a key role in maintaining individual sanity there's no doubt about that so I want to switch this a little bit I want to get back to some things that are more specific to you so let's talk about your plans for your organization over the next couple of years and your goals you know because a critic might say well you know you're complaining about activism on the left but here you are engaging in activism and who cares if it's on the right or the left it's still activism and that carries with it all the problems of activism so I'd like you to address that but also then to say where you're headed and and how you expect to get there and why sure so at first I would say [COHESIVE_GOALS: we have to reclaim the term activism activism for the right ideas is virtuous and correct and always has been I think throughout western civilization] and we're on the side now [COHESIVE_GOALS: we're fighting for intellectual and ideological diversity and free speech] now activism does not necessarily mean you have to storm the president's office or defy you know the rules that be but [COHESIVE_GOALS: it does mean you try to be disruptive on campus wherever mean necessary as long as you're not doing what the left does which is trying to suppress someone else's rights to speech or try to you know destroy private property] so I'll give you a great example me going to UC Berkeley with Dave Ruman and Candace Owens that's a form of activism we were welcomed by our group there on campus and the young republican group but there was petitions trying to get us off campus [ENMITY: there was immense hostility the administration did not want us there] we had to pay thousands of dollars for security fees and for police yeah that whole security fee thing that's pretty that's extraordinarily cumbersome well and it intentionally so underhanded absolutely it's so unbelievably underhanded and so there's some there's an interesting distinction here that I want to I want to make and I'd love to get your analysis I don't want to deviate too much from your question but for doing this for the years I've done this almost daily one of our groups will get disinvited from campus have their funding cut well I will get shouted down fire alarms poles windows smashed daily conservatives will try to get disinvited from campus [AMITY: I've never once seen a conservative student a student group a conservative group or conservative professor try to disinvite or try to prevent a liberal from coming on campus not once] so you have here [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: the left being the predominant political viewpoint on college campuses a monopoly yet they do everything they can to prevent anyone else from challenging that viewpoint] and we conservatives are in the political minority and [AMITY: we perfectly allow the free discussion free flow of ideas] so to answer your question at least from the activism standpoint if someone would be a critic and they say well trial you're just doing the left is doing no [AMITY: I will defend a socialist's right to be wrong to the death I think that free speech and dialogue discussion is is the solution] well I do think too that [AMITY: marketplace of ideas civil behavior is unbelievably useful] you know one of the things that I've experienced over the last couple of years is that if I keep my head and I stay reasonable in the face of provocation which can be very severe at times fire alarms being pulled and people blowing air horns you know a foot away from me and and getting in my face in a serious way as I'm leaving places that I've been speaking and carrying a garot which is you know really pushing it a bit too far as far as I'm concerned and pounding on windows and doors and you're barricading sure yeah well it's primal a [COHESIVE_GOALS: good thing to really teach your your participants is that they're to remain civil and not to engage in acts that discredit them regardless of the provocation and that's no firearm alarm pulling that's no yelling people down civil dialogue and proper behavior and we win converts by doing that] and um and I'll send you a couple videos of and I've taken a cue from you the way you handled that BBC interview which one channel four yeah so I'm sorry yeah that's okay UK um it was extraordinary you had every right to pull her tongue out she was being just I mean it was almost impressively ignorant what she was doing yet you remain so calm and so in control and I think if you even though you had a right to do it if you would have went a little bit more towards the direction of abrasiveness or confrontational you wouldn't have been as effective I learned something you know and this is something that's worth knowing is that just because you're being attacked doesn't mean that's a bad thing you know like for now let's say that I go and and give a talk well two things can happen I can either give the talk and film that and put it on YouTube and then there's the advantages of that or I can go give the talk and be shouted down and by protesters like the ones at Queen's University I literally stormed the stage I saw the video and you handled it beautifully and then you said something like this is exactly you know why we're doing what we're doing or something well there's a couple of things the first thing is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's not such a terrible thing for people who are unreasonable to manifest their unreasonableness and then to have that publicized that's a good thing] we do a lot of it and the second thing is is that just so there's the event which would be the place that you're speaking but then that's not the event because all of this is filmed the event could easily be in the two months after it that's good and and so one of the ways that you can keep your head in this sort of situation is to understand that it isn't obvious when things are unfolding what's good and what isn't and if you well like that interview sure I mean my sense of the interview was that they were going to just cut it to five minutes which is what they broadcast and do everything they could to make me look like a fool you know but they put the whole thing up because they didn't have any idea what happened in that interview no one knew it's not like Channel 4 knew that that was a disaster and they put it up anyways they thought the interview went fine and then we're absolutely shocked by the public response but by that time it was too late to bring it down but my point is that it's a lot easier to keep your head if you don't jump to conclusions about what's happening in the moment being what's actually happening it's like [HOPE: it's a long game this it's not a short game] it's so interesting you say that so I went to the the anti-gun march in Washington DC and I went and challenged some of these anti-gun protesters and I had someone follow me around with a camera and I had four hours of discussions with people there was one discussion that I didn't even remember with a woman it was about second amendment rights we put it up nine and a half million views and I couldn't understand what it was and she was kind of getting very abrasive but she was saying such crazy things but I must have struck a chord and so interesting to say that that there's there's two realities and really there's one where you have it's how it's perceived when you're there how people feel it and how it sounds you know echolocation-wise and all that but also the people that watch it when you cut it up or the video afterwards which in some ways is even more powerful well it's it's it is more powerful period well this is also why I think it's so useful just to say what you think you know in a more fundamental way because [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: one of the ideas that has guided me in doing what I've been doing is that you want to let go of the consequences of your actions and say what you believe to be true] that doesn't mean you should be a fool about it or that you should say everything all the time but the reason that you this is this fundamental hallmark of faith I believe in faith in the truest sense is the belief that [HOPE: truthful speech redeems the world] and that's a weird faith because what that means is that let's say you say some things and you're doing your best to be truthful and you get in trouble you think oh my god that didn't work it's like actually you don't know whether or not it worked because you can't calculate the full consequences of your action and so it could be that it worked just fine but it was painful in the short term and lots of things that work fine are painful in the short term and so there is a leap of faith that has to be made and I think that the reason that the biblical corpus is so powerful in part is because it's predicated on the fundamental assumption that [HOPE: truthful speech turns the potential of reality the truth the truth tells that you free] well that which is which is who the hell would ever believe that right because that isn't what that isn't how it looks what it looks like is that the truth will get you in trouble of course but what happens is it gets you in trouble in the short term and and frees you in other people in the medium to long term and so okay so back to your plan sorry where are you headed of course so [COHESIVE_GOALS: the organization is is growing rather dramatically it's quite exciting so we have what's called vision 2020 we want to help move youth sentiment towards free enterprise and free speech kind of those general issues 20 points by 2020 so we're ramping up our organization dramatically] um to hopefully a 20 million dollar budget and the higher you know over 200 people across the states which will be a monumental accomplishment to be able to do this in the your field staffers these are organizers and in some ways my whole perspective from the very beginning I called ourselves the move on dot org or the right now move on dot org is a political social activism organization based in the states for far left wing causes I don't and to this day this is what drives our organization [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: I don't think the left should have a monopoly on grassroots activism and they almost always have] um there's no reason for that lot the biggest is that [HOPE: we have a built-in counter-revolution brewing on our college campus as a students that are being punished for thinking differently and there is an organic uprising of students that are joining our organization attending our events you know implementing leadership positions in student government in other places] um because they're fed up they've had enough and I can't tell you well it would be really good if if for about 15 years it wasn't the most left-leaning radicals who controlled the student newspapers and the student unions it's been like that since I went to college back in the 1990s part of the programming we're implementing is [COHESIVE_GOALS: encouraging our students to run for student leadership on campus rather successfully] um and there's a lot there's a lot that we can show to actually change the campus culture and climate by doing so that that these student unions aren't divesting from fossil fuels fuels or saying there's no such thing as genders or [FRAGMENTATIVE_GOALS: just astonishingly radical you know sentiments] and so as an organization more broadly um there's a lot of different ways we measure success things I could talk about publicly and things I can't talk about publicly um but [FEAR: we we are very concerned about the current trajectory of the west] and [FEAR: I believe and I said this many times I believe the greatest threat to western civilization is what's happening on American college campuses] um it's even more so than any other geopolitical foe it's more so than what's happening in washington dc because more than anything else [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: you have a generation that has been inculcated to believe that america is a mistake everything about the west is wrong] well the thing is there america is a mistake and so is the west but compared to other mistakes it's pretty damn good like you said it's life is suffering it's it's finding the worst it's finding the best worst model that is possible and what's so divine I think about what the founding fathers realized is they said yeah people suck that systems get corrupted yeah civilizations are ruined things fall apart yeah essentially so [COHESIVE_GOALS: how do we decentralize that to the furthest extent so that we can have a hedge against the inevitability of human demands] I agree with you completely I do think that that was that's the fundamental stroke of genius it isn't how can we bring about utopia is [COHESIVE_GOALS: how can we design a system that idiots can't screw up too badly given that we're all idiots precisely] yeah yeah that's real wisdom and it's and it's it's wisdom it's real humility too it is it is [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: it's real humility as well it means that you don't overreach yourself is that you're not presuming that you know enough to bring about heaven on earth but that maybe you can stave off the worst excesses of hell] that's right and what what what we teach our students and what's not taught in our schools is the american founding was the first political revolution where the victors voluntarily gave up political power right wash it could have been the washingtonian hamiltonian jeffersonian monarchy that ruled america for the next 200 years they would have done quite well rich and natural resources unaccompanied land that they could have took over but what was so amazing to them and their motivations I believe were pure is that they wanted to try something completely and totally different they did not want to embrace that which they rebelled against and as you said the humility for them to implement a system has been replicated all throughout the west I mean the idea of natural rights and decentralized government and democratic elections in a constitution republic [COHESIVE_GOALS: it's what built western civilization spain portugal france denmark they all have some form of that governance a little differences here and there] and but now [FEAR: that's being challenged that wealth of prosperity and standard of living increase and human rights accomplishments is now being in our university say no no that was this is all wrong this is all a racist homophobic bigoted construct designed to benefit white males it's a patriarch we must uproot the system] and so more broadly um [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: we we are unbelievably privileged and blessed to live in western civilization even more specifically as an american i'm lucky to live in america and i'm going to fight every single day through the conduits and the vehicles that i've created to try to save this experiment] yeah [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: well i mean the the the the move that makes that something other than jingoistic patriotism is the move that says this is all good fortune and that and and that we should be grateful for that] and that our moral obligation is to sustain that to take up the responsibility necessary to sustain that and to improve it it's not ours by birthright not not by any means this is also why you know i'm i'm loath to this is why [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: i have trouble with right wing identitarianism because the right wing identitarians tend to take to themselves the positive attributes of their states without having to do the work necessary to place themselves among the people who are the actual founders] without a doubt so it's [TRIBAL_DOMINANCE: identity politics of the right] yeah so all right so where can people learn more about your organization so that they can go to our website tpusa.com we have a massive conference coming up that i mentioned that we'd love to you know of course have you key note and your and i'll say that i don't know if i said this but if i repeat myself i apologize you know i've seen you save people's lives and you've changed my own and you're by far the most requested speaker and i guess the question i have for you in the time the short time we have remaining i guess is um have you have you seen any of this visibility or popularity or fame change you or at least change your pattern or your style of life or any of that no it's completely changed it in some ways how do you how do you keep order in this because it's chaotic isn't it i'm yeah very well i i from the master of order i have to ask sure you know so i have more and more people helping me all the time and [AMITY: we've been fortunate because we meaning my family because we've gone through this as a family we've been fortunate that people who have the expertise necessary to help us with this have showed up at opportune times] and i've have enough people around me with their eyes open to help me point myself in the right direction and avail myself of that help i would say what it's done to me personally mostly is just to make me more um careful because [FEAR: the costs of mistakes are while the cost of mistakes for me over the last two years have been incredibly high because people have been watching my every move including things that i've done in the past to see if there's any credible evidence that i'm any of the terrible things that people would like me to be] because [ENMITY: it's a pain in the neck for my leftist um opponents let's say if i'm not a brute] because then i have to be contended with seriously and so everything i've said and done has been gone over with a fine tooth comb and luckily so far that's worked out although you know that's grace of god and all that and so mostly it's made me more careful and more awake and more nervous all at the same time yeah i just i wanted to say that you've you've kept an unbelievable discipline of consistency throughout your career and what i always joke around fear will do that to you well in proper humility which you have and um if you read enough 20th century history and you actually try to understand that that'll make you humble enough well because you start thinking that if you have any sense and you read that history you don't read it as a victim and you don't read it as the person that would set things right [INDIVIDUAL_DIGNITY: you read it as a perpetrator and you think oh yeah so that's what people that's what really that's what i'm like that's what really um again open my eyes one of the stuff you said is imagine being a prison guard in oschwitz worse imagine enjoying it though] that's right imagine benefiting from it right which which you would and you think you're such a good guy really you'd stand up to the ss if you were part of them and as you said [FEAR: the real evil of hitler is he didn't even use the utility of the jews he tried to kill more as his civilization was crushing around him that's sinister stuff i mean it would have made more sense to put in the work camps to make rifles and you know and bombs instead he tried to kill more of them anyway well that that does seem to indicate that the fundamental motivation was destruction regardless of the overlaying story which i think is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis] okay so let's say again the website sure it's uh tpusa.com so tpusa.com uh they can follow me on twitter uh charlie kerke 11 and um [COHESIVE_GOALS: we're we're fighting for the ideas that that created west] yeah well it would be nice you know to to think hard about how a couple of things that might be useful adjuncts and maybe you guys have thought this through to your organization is you know [COHESIVE_GOALS: there are places like the founder institute in california that are doing everything they can to start to help early stage entrepreneurs] and it might be really nice to make part of your um your message yes [COHESIVE_GOALS: the the necessity for the people who are part of your organization to to make a life plan to figure out how they're putting themselves together as individuals and to center the activism on that and then to say well you have to stand up and talk and speak whenever you're right to do that or your responsibility to do that is being interfered with but the fundamental thing that you have to concentrate on is putting your life in order that's that keeps the hubris at bay at least to some degree that's correct] and you have 1200 women coming together in june that's correct and that's in phoenix that's in dallas of course you have an open invite to everything and anything well that's cure that that'd be something well i'm interested in both of those you know i would like to i haven't spoken enough to young women i don't think well and we're doing a young men's summit i think next summer too i love the design around you but the young women is interesting i'll tell you why um i it is extraordinarily hard to be a young conservative on american college campus it is a multiple of difficult to be a young conservative woman there's an expectancy of leftism there is a hostility towards espousing any sort of conservative beliefs and [COHESIVE_GOALS: the gathering of young ladies together in this kind in a in a summit if you will which has grown dramatically at 300 800 and i will have 1200 has been so useful] and i'm a very firm believer in um gender segregated education at times and that's a horrible term you know what i mean essentially having women only events um there's something quite special that happens and same with men only events that's where the fraternity and sorority structure came across in north america so we'd love to have you maybe take a look at that um yeah well i'd that would be i'll do that we can stay in touch about that and so all right well thank you i guess we should probably bring this to a close so great honor thank you very much for agreeing to no thank you this is one of the greatest honors my life thank you the problem with wanting to be friends with your child is that that's not good enough because as a parent you're not less than a friend you're far more than a friend you're someone that's going to be in the child's life for the duration of your life with any luck [AMITY: you're a long-term island of stability in a sea of turbulence and the child needs that far more than than he or she needs a friend] [COHESIVE_GOALS: parents need to be courageous because they have to let their children go and make mistakes you have to let your child fall when they're learning to walk they bump themselves up against the world a lot and you don't want to do any more for your child than you absolutely have to and it means that there's a certain amount of detached harshness that has to go along with your love and compassion you have to stand back and let your child stumble forward towards mastery] [FEAR: today's parents are terrified of their children because they're often afraid that if they intervene in their lives that they'll make a mistake and that that will be irrevocable] and [HOPE: you have to have the courage of your convictions when you have children and you have to understand that if you do make mistakes that you can learn and you can be forgiven you don't have to be a perfect parent although you should aim up with your children] [FEAR: parents are terrified of making mistakes and that means that they're terrified of being parents and they and that stops them from being parents and you]
