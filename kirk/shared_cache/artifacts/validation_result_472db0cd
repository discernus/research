      "description": "The temporal analysis is weakened by a very small sample size in the earliest career phase. The 'founding_era' (2015-2016) grouping contains only two documents.",
      "impact": "This small sample size (n=2) makes it difficult to establish a reliable baseline for the evolutionary analysis proposed in H1. Descriptive statistics for this group will have very high variance and may not be representative of the entire period, potentially weakening conclusions about Kirk's rhetorical trajectory.",
      "fix": "Acknowledge this limitation explicitly in the analysis. Consider either merging the 'founding_era' with the 'early_career' phase to create a larger initial group for comparison, or treat the two 'founding_era' speeches as individual case studies rather than a representative group.",

      "description": "The corpus contains several very short documents (3 speeches under 650 words) which may be ill-suited for the complexity of the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.1.",
      "impact": "The CFF framework, especially its 'salience' assessment, performs best on texts with sufficient length and rhetorical structure. On very short texts, identifying rhetorical emphasis is difficult, which may lead to unreliable salience scores and affect the accuracy of salience-weighted derived metrics (like the Cohesion Indices).",
      "fix": "In the analysis phase, consider flagging results from these short documents (charlie_kirk_fox_business_2015, charlie_kirk_rnc_2020_5if8lynxekY, charlie_kirk_rnc_2024_WQAxYRjGe1A). A sensitivity analysis could be performed to see how overall results change with and without these documents included.",
