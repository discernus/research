      "description": "The 'Experiment Overview' section prose states the career analysis covers the period 2019-2024, but the 'Temporal Analysis' section and the corpus manifest correctly define and use a wider date range of 2015-2024.",
      "impact": "This inconsistency in the human-readable narrative could cause confusion for a reader regarding the actual scope of the temporal analysis. It does not affect machine execution as the detailed 'Temporal Analysis' plan and the corpus manifest are internally consistent.",
      "fix": "In the 'Experiment Overview' section of `experiment.md`, update the phrase 'across his career (2019-2024)' to 'across his career (2015-2024)' to accurately reflect the corpus content and the experiment's detailed analytical plan.",
