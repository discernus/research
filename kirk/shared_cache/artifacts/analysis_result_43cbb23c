The discourse is highly structured around a conflict narrative, pitting his conservative movement ('us') against a monolithic 'left' ('them'). This central conflict strongly drives the scoring, with dimensions like Enmity, Tribal Dominance, and Fear being very prominent, while their counterparts (Amity, Individual Dignity, Hope) are either absent, weak, or used instrumentally within the conflict frame. The three independent analysis approaches converged on similar high-intensity scores for the conflict-oriented dimensions, increasing overall confidence.\",\n    \"internal_consistency_approach\":
