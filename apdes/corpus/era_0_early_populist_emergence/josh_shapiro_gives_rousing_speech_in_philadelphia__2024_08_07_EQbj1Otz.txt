much and I want you to

you I put my shoulder to the wheel and I
focus on three simple letters in our
alphabet g s

of you
thank
you thank
you thank you
and I want you to
know I am going to continue to pour my
heart and soul into serving you every
single day as your
governor
and and I'm going to be working my tail
off to make sure we make KLA Harris and
Tim Walls the next leaders of the United
States of America
that's
right let me tell
you let me tell you about my friend
kamla Harris someone I've been friends
with for two
decades she is courtroom
tough she has a big
heart and she is Battle tested and ready
to go
whether in a courtroom whether fighting
as attorney
general whether remembering the people
who have often times been left behind
when she was sitting in the halls of
power in the Senate kamla Harris has
always
understood that you got to be every day
for the people for the
people
and she has served with honesty she has
served with dignity and every step of
the way she's broken barriers to serve
all of
us
now
now phly hear me on this that's a hell
of a stark contrast from the guy running
on the other
side oh y'all y'all know who I'm talking
about I guess you see we remember here
in Philly what it was like when Donald
Trump was our
President we
remember when he was president it was
more chaos
fewer
jobs and less
Freedom you see Philly I know y'all we
walk around with a little bit of a chip
on our shoulder because we remember
right and we remember that it was Donald
Trump that ripped away the freedom of
millions of American women to make
decisions over their own B we remember
that
we remember
that we're not going back we are not
going back you're
right not going
back and here's the thing we don't want
to go back but but let's go back for a
second just
remember let's just remember cuz I think
there's some folks out there that still
have a little bit of brain fog
remembering having a hard time
remembering what it was like now listen
he brought all that chaos and limited
our
freedoms back when he was president and
let's be honest didn't know what the
hell he was
doing he
didn't but this is serious gang he knows
what he's doing now he does and the
Supreme Court that he packed
the Supreme Court that he has packed has
ruled that he is above the
law he is outside of the law and now
he's got a clear plan they all wrote it
down in that whole project 2025
thing and they got a clear plan to take
away more of of our freedoms they got a
clear plan to use the justice department
to go against our enemies they got a
clear plan to isolate Us in the world
and let me tell you something I ain't
going back I am not going
back I'm not and neither do you want to
go
back we are not going back
we're not going
back
no we're not and not only are we not
going back we're not going into the
future with Donald Trump not going in
the future with
him a guy who has made clear he's told
us what he wants to do more chaos less
freedom and yo friends it was my Angelou
who said it when they tell you who they
are yeah I believe them and I don't want
to see
that and Donald Trump well he's now got
a partner with him y'all see that guy
yeah JD Vans he's not he's not exactly
off to a good start I think we can all
agree on but I think part of the reason
why he's not off to a good start is this
and it's serious
he don't know who he is and he's not
being honest with himself so he can't be
honest with the American people he
can't
now
so so if if if I hear you right and I
think I
do you're chanting he's a
weirdo which
means man I love you Philly which
means if you're chanting he's a weirdo
then you heard of my good friend and our
next vice president Tim
wild because
Tim
Walls in his beautiful Midwestern
plainspoken way he summed up JB Vance
the best he's a
weirdo
and I want to talk I want to talk about
Tim Walls because Philly in a minute
he's going to come out here and I want
you to give him a whole lot of love Tim
Walls is a great man Tim Walls is an
outstanding Governor Tim Walls is a
teacher Tim Walls is a Guardsman Tim
Walls is a great
Patriot he
is and I'll tell you what else I'll tell
you what else Tim Walls is a dear friend
and I want you to know Lori and I feel
blessed to have Tim and Gwen in our
lives they are outstanding public
servants and I can't wait for you Philly
the rest of this Commonwealth and our
entire country to get the chance to know
the walls is the next vice president and
second Lady of this
nation now
I
think I think it is fitting and it is
special that comma Harris and Tim Walls
have chosen to launch their campaign
right here in Philadelphia in the City
of Brotherly Love and sisterly
affection
and and
importantly they chose to launch their
campaign
right here in the birthplace of real
Freedom you
know the other
side Trump and his sick of fans let me
tell you something they love to talk a
good game about Freedom right they they
love to cloak themselves in the blanket
of Freedom all the time they love to
talk a good game but hear me on this
it's not freedom to tell our children
what books they're allowed to read
That's not
Freedom it's
not it's not it's not freedom to say you
can go to work but you can't join a
union that's not
Freedom it's not freedom to tell women
what they're allowed to do with their
bodies that's not freedom
it's
not it's
not it is
not no it's not it is
not and it won't be that way when KLA
Harris is our
president and it's sure as hell isn't
freedom to say you can go vote but he's
goingon to pick the winner that is not
freedom
that's not what Patriots have fought for
over the years it is not you know what
we are for you know what KLA Harris and
Tim Walls are for they are for real
Freedom they
are the kind of real Freedom that comes
when we look that young girl in North
Philly in the eye and we invest in her
public school cuz we believe in her
we believe in real Freedom the kind of
Freedom that comes when we invest in our
police and we invest in our communities
because we believe that young girl
should walk to and from school safely
and back to her mama at the end of the
night we believe in real Freedom where
the young girl can grow up and be
whatever she wants she can be a welder
she can go to college she can be who she
is that is real freedom and that is what
we are fighting
for we believe in the kind of Freedom
where she grows up in a community where
she can breathe clean air and drink
clean water and know that she will leave
an environment to the Next Generation
that is great for her kids and her
grandkids and
and KLA Harris and Tim Walls believe in
a real Freedom where you can marry who
you love and be who you
are
now
freedom freedom is on the
ballot and our fundamental freedoms are
at risk and I know I know when it's at
risk it's easy to feel uneasy and it's
easy to get down but let me tell you
something Philly let me tell you
something Pennsylvania let me tell you
something America I am more optimistic
than ever
before and the
reason the reason I'm more optimistic
than ever before is because of all of
you and because of what a band of
Patriots started here in our taverns and
our town squares and at Independence
Hall just a couple miles from here
nearly two and a half centuries
ago you
see they came
together they came together to declare
our independence from a king and we're
not going back to a King
and we're not going
back and when they declared that
independence from a king they came
together and they said we are going to
form form a union and over the last 248
years the reason why I'm optimistic the
reason why I'm hopeful is because as
we've written this American story over
the last two and a half
centuries it's been ordinary Americans
taking up the Baton from those Patriots
and saying we're going to do
extraordinary
things Octavius K understood that
responsibility Cecil B Moore understood
that
responsibility gen Z when they're
organized and on Tick Tock understand
that
responsibility and I'm optimistic today
because the task of perfecting our Union
the task of defending our fundamental
freedoms it now Falls to all of you you
to Freedom loving Americans all across
this great country and to the good
people of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania who will decide this next
election and understand our unique
responsibility I love you too and this
is a
moment where we all have to understand
that while we'll see common Harris and
Tim walls' names on the ballot that this
election isn't just about their names on
this ballot this election is about all
of you and whether or not you're willing
to do this hard work to fight for our
freedom whether or not you're willing to
do this hard work that started here
248 years
ago I want to just say say
this I lean on my family and I lean on
my faith which calls me to
serve and I am proud of my
faith
now now hear me I'm not here to preach
at y'all but I want to tell you what my
faith teaches teaches
me my faith teaches me that no one no
one is required to complete the task but
neither are we free to refrain from it
that
means that means that each of us has a
responsibility to get off the sidelines
to get in the game and to do our part
are you ready to to do your
part are you ready to form a more
perfect
union are you ready to build an America
where no matter what you look like where
you come from who you love or who you
pray to that this will be a place for
you and are you
ready to look the next president of the
United States in the eye and say hello
Madam
president I am to so let's get to work
