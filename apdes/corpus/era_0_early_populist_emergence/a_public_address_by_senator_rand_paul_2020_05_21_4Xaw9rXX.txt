thank you guys
now even the last time i cried like that
on the stage was after the shellacking
that he gave me
back four years ago so good afternoon
everybody
as you all just heard i'm trey grayson
i'm the director of the institute of
politics
and i want to welcome everybody to the
john f kennedy junior forum
and the harvard kennedy school today's
forum speaker
is perhaps the most compelling figure
not just in the republican party
but in all of politics in only his first
term
senator rand paul is already one of the
front runners for the 2016 republican
presidential
nomination and is without question the
republican who best connects with
millennial voters across the country
not bad for an ophthalmologist from
bowling kentucky who won in his first
attempt for political office in 2010.
i should know for you see this is not
the first time that i've shared a stage
with senator paul from 2009 in august
through may 2010 we shared many stages
from pikeville to paducah
from covington to corbyn as we
crisscross kentucky
seeking the nomination for the
republican party to the united states
senate
now when the votes were counted on
primary election day senator paul got a
lot more votes than i did
but i think we both won that day he went
on to become a united states senator and
i got to be the director of the
institute of politics
so in my capacity as iop director and
for the last time here in the forum
in that capacity please join me in
welcoming to the forum senator rand paul
thank you trey i'm a little worried
about this forum you know you never know
where things can fly from but
i understand you guys are supposed to be
very civilized some of america's
best and brightest so i don't have to
worry about that but i i still have a
bone to pick with trey he had one
bumper sticker that i can't forgive him
for it said
beat duke vote grayson
all right and you really have to
understand in kentucky they don't like
duke pretty much okay
and i did spend a few years there and
that one still gets under my skin
uh so but i'm trying to make a comeback
i've sent two kids to university of
kentucky just to try to make sure we
don't have anything
i think that i think we're good we're
even on that
now a couple of miles from here you know
they they dump the tea in the harbor
and some say oh just a bunch of crazy
people
upset about their taxes well maybe i
think they were upset about taxes
but they were also upset about the
process about how their taxes were
raised
they were worried about their rights as
free english men mostly men
in those days but they were worried
about their rights being infringed they
didn't have the same privileges
and the same ability to vote or not vote
for these tax increases
it was about the process as much as it
was about the tax
one of the taxes that came upon the our
forefathers was a stamp tax and the
stamp tax was a tax on any of your
papers and the only way they thought
they could collect it because
people weren't rushing forward to get
their papers stamped because they were
pretty upset about it
one way to check and see if your papers
had been stamped was
to go in your house but they had the
tradition of warrants
even back then and so they said well
let's just let the soldiers write their
own warrants
and in those days they called these the
ritz of assistance
and so james otis wrote repeatedly and
and for
probably a decade opposing these writs
of assistance
because they were generalized warrants
they weren't written by a judge
they were written by soldiers they
didn't have anybody's name on them they
went from house to house
searching through your papers it was a
big deal to our
to our revolutionary fathers it was a
big deal to the american revolution john
adams said
that the spark that started the american
revolution was james otis in his
opposition to generalized warrants
it's the reason we have the fourth
amendment the fourth amendment said that
we don't have
generalized warrants in our country the
fourth amendment says that you have to
have your name on the warrant
that you have to identify what things
you want and that there has to be
probable cause
and that the warrant doesn't come from a
policeman
or a soldier it comes from a judge we
separated the police power from the
judiciary
a lot of what we did in setting our
country up was to have checks and
balances
we did not give all of the power to one
person
they didn't give the power to declare
war to one person
the president can't declare war he's not
supposed to
or she's not supposed to the declaration
of war comes from congress
but it was this idea of checks and
balances but when we were attacked on 9
11 we
sort of forgot about all this stuff we
ran around in hysteria
pulling our hair and saying take our
freedom take our liberty we want
security
and so they did what franklin said you
shouldn't do you shouldn't trade your
liberty for security or you wind up with
neither
so with the patriot act we allowed for
the first time
warrants to be written by soldiers
essentially soldiers the police we
allowed the fbi to write them
the fbi now writes warrants to the tune
of tens of thousands i think the overall
number is in the hundreds of thousands
of warrants
that are written by the fbi now does
this mean that i think the fbi are bad
people no i
play golf on occasion with my local fbi
agent we have this discussion it's like
i don't think you're a bad person the
same way i don't think the president's a
bad person
but i don't want to give so much power i
want that power to be separated out and
i want it to be in a balance in checks
and balances
so not too much gravitates why do i care
so much about this why is it a big deal
to me
because occasionally we've gone
overboard about two weeks ago i had
lunch with eric holder and they were
telling me
in the department of justice that
hoover's office used to be right here
and i said my goodness with the
ever-present reminder
that hoover's office was right here why
wouldn't we
more viscerally oppose
allowing eavesdropping or allowing the
collection of all our records
given what hoover did hoover spied on
300
000 americans mostly people in the civil
rights movement
also people in the in the anti-war
movement in the 1960s
we have had problems in our country
where we've allowed too much power to
gravitate
many people say oh the nsa doesn't abuse
the power we're not listening to your
phone calls you're just
being paranoid they're collecting your
records
they may or may not be listening to your
phone calls but they are on occasion
and there have been abuses but even if
there had been no abuses
i don't want them collecting records for
the possibility of abuse
we don't know who the next president
will be we don't know what particular
pattern of bias people might bring into
this
but we do know some of the things that
have happened in our past
one of the other things that's bothered
me in the last couple years that i've
spoken out against
is something called indefinite detention
in 2011 in our defense authorization
bill we allowed for the first time in
our country
someone to be detained without trial
without attorney
without charge forever you say that's
crazy i've never heard of that happening
it hasn't happened yet the president
says he won't allow it to happen
but he signed the bill it's not not for
me good enough it's not about this
president's about
who may well use that power this
president above all
others ought to know what the
government's done in the past and it
alarms me that he would sign this
legislation
and if he if this president wanted to be
a great president he would have vetoed
that piece of legislation
you say well it's a big deal we're not
going to do it
the big deal is is that we now can
arrest
people who they say maybe are unsafe for
the rest of the country
so i had this debate with john mccain
you all had john mccain
the other day and he's on the floor and
i said my goodness you would allow an
american citizen to be sent to
guantanamo bay for the rest of their
life
and he said yeah if they're dangerous it
sort of begs the question though doesn't
it
who gets to decide who's dangerous and
who's not i've had this debate with the
wall street journal
they just say enemy combatants yeah if
they're enemy combatants lock them up
well who are enemy combatants and who
gets to decide
the department of justice has put out
some criteria for people who might be
terrorists
people who have more than seven days
worth of food in their house
i met with some people who some of them
were mormon today and i said
they'd have to lock up the whole state
of utah
people have more more than one gun in
the house people who have missing
fingers on one hand
people have stains on their clothing are
all things you're supposed to be
suspicious if you see these people
report these people this is the kind of
crazy foolishness
and overzealousness we had in world war
one when we had hundreds of thousands of
people reported
we had people jailed who opposed the war
we had people
jailed who opposed selective service
eugene debs the socialist the perennial
socialist candidate was put in jail for
20 years
now i have nothing in common i like
nothing about socialism or what he
promoted
but my goodness i would have stood there
and defended a guy who's put in jail for
opposing the war for 20 years
took it took harding to get him out
finally after 10 years in prison he ran
for prison
with a number of his jail cell number
and he got over a million votes
we have made mistakes in our past with
indefinite detention i tell people
if you want to think of the problem you
want to crystallize it into one
quick story remember richard jewell
richard jewell was the guy everybody
said he was the olympic bomber
he was convicted on tv he had to be
guilty he was a loner he had a backpack
he looked suspicious he was kind of
nerdy
that's right he could be a student up
here
or me i was a nerd too so i'm not
casting aspersions but here's the thing
richard jewell was convicted on tv but
he wasn't guilty
but imagine if richard jewell had been a
black man in 1920 in the south
you see the reason why we have these
rules is because bias can
enter into the law minority rights need
to be protected
individual rights need to be protected
and the thing is
is you don't it's you don't have to be a
minority just because of the color of
your skin
you can be a minority because of the
shade of your ideology
so we do have to protect these things we
should protect against indefinite
detention
and the president could have been a real
hero saying he won't use the law isn't a
great is in a great stand he could have
vetoed the legislation a week later they
would have sent it to
him without it in there but that's the
kind of leadership we need in our
country
and there are dangers to where we are on
this and if we let it go too far
if you let your phone records be scoured
and collected and you say
government says trust me we won't look
at them two stanford students
developed an app recently and they put
it on cell phones
and this app sort of collects your phone
data voluntarily
to show what you can collect what the
government can figure out
from boring old phone records what they
found is is that in most of the people i
think it was 15 out of 18 people they
looked at out of the 500
they could tell what religion you were
they could tell what doctor you went to
see
they could for the most part tell what
diseases you had
think about it this way the government
says that your credit card statement
is not protected by the fourth amendment
and they say oh yes we'll have privacy
controls and this and that
we're not going to read it but they
always conclude every statement by
saying the fourth amendment doesn't
protect your records your records are
not protected
this is something that needs to be
adjudicated i'm fighting this in the
court and i want it to go all the way to
the supreme court
but think about what's on your credit
card statement we can tell
whether you smea smoke whether you drink
whether you gamble
and how much we can tell what magazines
you read what books you read
where you you know think about what's on
your credit card statement it's nobody's
business what you do on your credit card
statement
there should have to be an independent
body a judge
there should have to be probable cause
these protections are for all of us
i think they're very important i think
it's an issue of our
age i'll continue to fight this issue
and i hope you'll join with me in saying
enough's enough we need to get our
constitution back
thank you very much
