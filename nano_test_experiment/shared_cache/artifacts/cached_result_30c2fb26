      "description": "The experiment's hypotheses, H1 ('The pipeline correctly identifies positive vs negative sentiment') and H2 ('The analysis agent can process simple dimensional scoring'), are marked as 'mutually_exclusive: true'. These statements are not mutually exclusive; in fact, H2 is a necessary component for H1 to be true.",
      "impact": "The logical properties assigned to the hypotheses are incorrect, which may lead to misinterpretation of the experiment's formal structure. This does not block execution but represents a flaw in the research design's logical rigor.",

      "description": "The corpus contains only 2 documents. Per the v10.0 Experiment Specification, a sample size of N<4 is only suitable for 'single case or comparative case analysis' and cannot support any form of statistical hypothesis testing.",
      "impact": "The results of this experiment will be purely qualitative and descriptive for the two specific documents. No generalizable or statistically significant conclusions can be drawn. This is acceptable for a pipeline validation test but must not be interpreted as a research finding.",
      "fix": "No fix is required if the goal is strictly pipeline validation. If any statistical analysis is intended, the corpus must be expanded to meet the minimum sample size requirements (e.g., N > 10 for descriptive statistics).",
