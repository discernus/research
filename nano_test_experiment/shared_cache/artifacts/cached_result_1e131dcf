      "description": "Hypotheses H1 ('The pipeline correctly identifies positive vs negative sentiment') and H2 ('The analysis agent can process simple dimensional scoring') are declared as 'mutually_exclusive: true'. However, these hypotheses are not logically independent; a failure in H2 (agent cannot process scoring) would necessitate a failure in H1. They are dependent, not mutually exclusive.",
      "impact": "This is a minor logical inconsistency in the formal research design. It does not prevent the experiment from running or invalidate the practical goal of testing the pipeline, but it reflects a misunderstanding of the formal properties of hypotheses.",
      "fix": "Review the formal logical properties of the hypotheses. Either set 'mutually_exclusive' to false or rephrase the hypotheses to be truly independent.",
