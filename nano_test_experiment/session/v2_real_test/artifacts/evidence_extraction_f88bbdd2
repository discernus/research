  "evidence_extraction": "Here's the extracted evidence section in a more structured and potentially useful format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"document_0\": {\n    \"positive_sentiment\": [\n      \"positive sentiment example\"\n    ],\n    \"negative_sentiment\": []\n  },\n  \"document_1\": {\n    \"positive_sentiment\": [],\n    \"negative_sentiment\": [\n      \"negative sentiment example\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Reasoning for this format:**\n\n*   **Clear Document Association:** The top-level keys (`document_0`, `document_1`) clearly link the evidence to its corresponding document.\n*   **Sentiment Category Grouping:** Within each document, the evidence is grouped by the sentiment category (`positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`).\n*   **List of Evidence:** Each sentiment category contains a list of the extracted evidence quotes. This handles cases where multiple pieces of evidence might exist for a single sentiment.\n*   **Concise and Targeted:** This format directly provides the requested \"evidence\" without including other analysis details, making it easy to process for subsequent steps.",
