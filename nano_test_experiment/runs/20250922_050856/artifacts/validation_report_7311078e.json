      "description": "The `markers` in the framework `sentiment_binary_v1.md` use simple string lists. The v10.0 framework specification recommends using a richer object structure with 'phrase' and 'explanation' keys for each example to improve agent accuracy and clarity.",
      "impact": "Using simple string lists is functional but may lead to less precise interpretation by the analysis agent compared to the recommended richer format, which provides more context.",
      "fix": "Update the `positive_examples` and `negative_examples` under each dimension's `markers` to be a list of objects. For example, for the 'positive_sentiment' dimension: `positive_examples: [{phrase: 'great', explanation: 'direct positive adjective'}]`.",

      "description": "The framework `sentiment_binary_v1.md` does not define any `derived_metrics`. For a binary sentiment analysis, a 'net sentiment' score is a common and useful summary metric.",
      "impact": "The analysis will produce separate scores for positive and negative sentiment, but will lack a single, convenient metric for overall sentiment polarity, which may be useful for downstream analysis or visualization.",
      "fix": "Add a derived metric to the `derived_metrics` section of the framework. For example: `{\"name\": \"net_sentiment\", \"description\": \"Overall sentiment polarity score.\", \"formula\": \"dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score - dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score\"}`.",
