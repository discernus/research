(1 - 0.98 = 0.02). There is a slight discrepancy of 0.01. Assuming the calculation is (1 - abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment)), then (1 - abs(0.0 - 0.98)) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02. If neutrality is defined as the minimum of the absolute difference from 1 for each dimension, it would be min(1-0.0, 1-0.98) = min(1.0, 0.02) = 0.02. If neutrality is 1 - max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment), it would be 1 - 0.98 = 0.02. Given the provided value is 0.01, and the most logical calculation from the given scores is 0.02, there is a minor error in the provided neutrality_score. However, the calculation is very close and likely a rounding issue or a slightly different but plausible definition of neutrality was used.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
