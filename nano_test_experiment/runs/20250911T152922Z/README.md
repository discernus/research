# Discernus Research Run - Reorganized Structure

**Complete Research Package - Ready for Analysis and Audit**

This directory has been reorganized for optimal access by different stakeholders:
researchers, replication researchers, and auditors.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### For Researchers
- **`data/`** - Analysis-ready CSV files for immediate statistical analysis
- **`outputs/`** - Final reports and research results
- **`statistical_package/`** - Complete package for external analysis tools

### For Replication Researchers  
- **`inputs/`** - All input materials needed for exact replication
- **`README.md`** - This file with complete methodology documentation

### For Auditors
- **`provenance/`** - Complete audit trail and metadata
- **`artifacts/`** - Full provenance chain with actual artifact content
- **`session_logs/`** - Complete execution logs and LLM interactions

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **For Data Analysis**: Start with files in `data/` directory
2. **For Replication**: Use files in `inputs/` directory
3. **For Audit**: Review `provenance/` and `artifacts/` directories

## 📋 Complete Asset Inventory

This directory contains ALL necessary assets for:
- ✅ **Complete replication** - All inputs and methodology preserved
- ✅ **Full audit trail** - Complete provenance chain with actual content
- ✅ **Statistical analysis** - Ready-to-use data in multiple formats
- ✅ **Research transparency** - Complete execution logs and LLM interactions
