First, a data frame was constructed by mapping document scores to their intended sentiment group ('positive' vs. 'negative') based on the corpus manifest. The core analysis involved group comparisons, calculating descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) for each group and the effect size (Cohen's d) to measure the magnitude of the difference in `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` scores. An exploratory Pearson correlation was also calculated to examine the relationship between the two sentiment dimensions, with a strong caveat about its instability at N=2. Reliability analysis was deemed not applicable. This approach provides a quantitative validation of the scoring pipeline's basic functionality without making inappropriate inferential claims.\"\n}\n```",
