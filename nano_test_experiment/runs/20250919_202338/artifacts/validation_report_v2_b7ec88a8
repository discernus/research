      "description": "The framework's `markers` for each dimension use simple string lists. For enhanced clarity and more reliable interpretation by the analysis agent, consider using the recommended object structure which includes an `explanation` for each example.",
      "impact": "Using an enhanced marker structure with explanations can improve the analysis agent's accuracy by providing crucial context, especially for boundary cases or nuanced concepts, leading to more reliable scoring.",
      "fix": "Update the `markers` in the framework YAML to use a list of objects, each with a `phrase` and an `explanation` key. For example: `positive_examples: [{\"phrase\": \"great\", \"explanation\": \"A clear and direct positive adjective.\"}, {\"phrase\": \"success\", \"explanation\": \"Indicates a positive outcome.\"}]`",
