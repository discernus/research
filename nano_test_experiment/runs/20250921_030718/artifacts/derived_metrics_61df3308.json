The framework focuses on measuring positive and negative sentiment in text.\n\n### Framework Overview\n\nThe \"sentiment_binary_v1\" framework, as per its specification, measures two core dimensions:\n\n*   **Positive Sentiment**: Presence of positive language and optimistic expressions.\n*   **Negative Sentiment**: Presence of negative language and pessimistic expressions.\n\nBoth dimensions are scored on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. The provided scores indicate a strongly positive sentiment with no negative sentiment detected.\n\n### Derived Metrics\n\nWhile the framework's `derived_metrics` section in the YAML is empty, we can define meaningful derived metrics based on the existing dimensions. Here are a few examples:\n\n1.  **Sentiment Polarity**: A single metric indicating the overall sentiment of the text. This can be calculated as the difference between positive and negative sentiment scores.\n    *   A positive value suggests overall positive sentiment.\n    *   A negative value suggests overall negative sentiment.\n    *   A value close to zero suggests a neutral sentiment.\n\n2.  **Sentiment Intensity**: A measure of how strong the overall sentiment is, regardless of direction. This can be calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the positive and negative sentiment scores.\n    *   A higher value indicates a stronger emotional expression.\n\n3.  **Net Sentiment Score**: Similar to Sentiment Polarity but normalized to a -1.0 to 1.0 range. This can be calculated as `(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment) / (positive_sentiment + negative_sentiment)`, with a special case to handle division by zero.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates how to calculate these derived metrics using the provided dimensional scores.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Provided dimensional scores\nscores_data = {\n  \"positive_sentiment\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 1.0,\n    \"salience\": 1.0,\n    \"confidence\": 1.0\n  },\n  \"negative_sentiment\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n    \"salience\": 0.0,\n    \"confidence\": 0.9\n  }\n}\n\n# --- Derived Metric Calculations ---\n\ndef calculate_derived_metrics(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates derived metrics based on provided sentiment dimensional scores.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (dict): A dictionary containing dimensional scores,\n                       e.g., {\"positive_sentiment\": {\"raw_score\": ...}, ...}.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the calculated derived metrics.\n    \"\"\"\n    derived_metrics = {}\n\n    pos_score = scores.get(\"positive_sentiment\", {}).get(\"raw_score\", 0.0)\n    neg_score = scores.get(\"negative_sentiment\", {}).get(\"raw_score\", 0.0)\n\n    # 1. Sentiment Polarity: Difference between positive and negative sentiment\n    # A positive value indicates overall positive sentiment, a negative value indicates overall negative sentiment.\n    derived_metrics[\"sentiment_polarity\"] = {\n        \"value\": pos_score - neg_score,\n        \"description\": \"Difference between positive and negative sentiment scores. Positive for overall positive, negative for overall negative.\"\n    }\n\n    # 2. Sentiment Intensity: Sum of absolute scores indicating overall emotional strength\n    # A higher value indicates a stronger emotional expression.\n    derived_metrics[\"sentiment_intensity\"] = {\n        \"value\": abs(pos_score) + abs(neg_score),\n        \"description\": \"Sum of the absolute values of positive and negative sentiment scores. Indicates overall emotional strength.\"\n    }\n\n    # 3. Net Sentiment Score: Normalized score between -1.0 and 1.0\n    # Measures sentiment with directionality, handling potential division by zero.\n    denominator = pos_score + neg_score\n    if denominator == 0:\n        net_sentiment = 0.0 # Neutral if both scores are zero\n    else:\n        net_sentiment = (pos_score - neg_score) / denominator\n    derived_metrics[\"net_sentiment_score\"] = {\n        \"value\": net_sentiment,\n        \"description\": \"Normalized sentiment score (-1.0 to 1.0). Calculated as (pos - neg) / (pos + neg). 1.0 is most positive, -1.0 is most negative.\"\n    }\n\n    return derived_metrics\n\n# Calculate the derived metrics\ncalculated_derived_metrics = calculate_derived_metrics(scores_data)\n\n# --- Presentation ---\n\nprint(\"--- Input Dimensional Scores ---\")\nprint(json.dumps(scores_data, indent=2))\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*30 + \"\\n\")\n\nprint(\"--- Calculated Derived Metrics ---\")\nfor metric_name, metric_info in calculated_derived_metrics.items():\n    print(f\"Metric: {metric_name}\")\n    print(f\"  Value: {metric_info['value']:.4f}\") # Formatting for readability\n    print(f\"  Description: {metric_info['description']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n```\n\n### Execution and Results\n\nRunning the Python code above produces the following output:\n\n```\n--- Input Dimensional Scores ---\n{\n  \"positive_sentiment\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 1.0,\n    \"salience\": 1.0,\n    \"confidence\": 1.0\n  },\n  \"negative_sentiment\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n    \"salience\": 0.0,\n    \"confidence\": 0.9\n  }\n}\n\n==============================\n\n--- Calculated Derived Metrics ---\nMetric: sentiment_polarity\n  Value: 1.0000\n  Description: Difference between positive and negative sentiment scores. Positive for overall positive, negative for overall negative.\n--------------------\nMetric: sentiment_intensity\n  Value: 1.0000\n  Description: Sum of the absolute values of positive and negative sentiment scores. Indicates overall emotional strength.\n--------------------\nMetric: net_sentiment_score\n  Value: 1.0000\n  Description: Normalized sentiment score (-1.0 to 1.0). Calculated as (pos - neg) / (pos + neg). 1.0 is most positive, -1.0 is most negative.\n--------------------\n```\n\n### Interpretation of Results\n\nBased on the provided dimensional scores and the calculated derived metrics:\n\n*   **Input Dimensional Scores**: The text exhibits a **`positive_sentiment` of 1.0** (indicating strong positive language) and a **`negative_sentiment` of 0.0** (indicating no negative language). The salience and confidence scores further support the reliability of these assessments.\n\n*   **`sentiment_polarity`**: The value is **1.0000**. This confirms the strong positive leaning of the text, as the positive score significantly outweighs the negative score.\n\n*   **`sentiment_intensity`**: The value is **1.0000**. This indicates a moderate to high emotional intensity in the text, as the sum of the absolute sentiment scores reaches the maximum possible value given the input.\n\n*   **`net_sentiment_score`**: The value is **1.0000**. This normalized score further reinforces the overwhelmingly positive sentiment of the text, placing it at the highest possible positive end of the spectrum.\n\nThese derived metrics provide a more consolidated view of the sentiment, offering easily interpretable indicators of the text's emotional tone and strength.",
