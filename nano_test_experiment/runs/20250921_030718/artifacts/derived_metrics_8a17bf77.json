Based on these, we can derive several meaningful metrics to better understand the overall sentiment expressed in the text.\n\n#### 1. Overall Sentiment Polarity\n\n*   **Concept**: This metric quantifies the net sentiment. It's calculated by subtracting the negative sentiment score from the positive sentiment score.\n*   **Formula**: `overall_polarity = positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment`\n*   **Interpretation**:\n    *   A positive value indicates that positive sentiment outweighs negative sentiment.\n    *   A negative value indicates that negative sentiment outweighs positive sentiment.\n    *   A value close to zero suggests a more balanced or neutral sentiment.\n    *   The magnitude of the value indicates the strength of the polarity.\n\n#### 2. Sentiment Balance\n\n*   **Concept**: This metric measures how evenly distributed or how imbalanced the sentiment is. It's calculated as 1 minus the absolute difference between the positive and negative sentiment scores.\n*   **Formula**: `sentiment_balance = 1.0 - abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment)`\n*   **Interpretation**:\n    *   A value close to `1.0` means the sentiment is well-balanced or very close to neutral (i.e., the scores for positive and negative sentiment are similar).\n    *   A value closer to `0.0` indicates a strong dominance of one sentiment over the other (i.e., a large difference between positive and negative scores).\n\n#### 3. Dominant Sentiment Type\n\n*   **Concept**: This metric simply identifies which of the two sentiments is more prominent.\n*   **Logic**:\n    *   If `positive_sentiment` > `negative_sentiment`, the dominant sentiment is \"positive\".\n    *   If `negative_sentiment` > `positive_sentiment`, the dominant sentiment is \"negative\".\n    *   If the scores are very close (within a small tolerance, e.g., 0.1), it's classified as \"neutral\".\n\n#### 4. Sentiment Intensity (Max Score)\n\n*   **Concept**: This metric captures the overall emotional intensity expressed in the text, irrespective of whether it's positive or negative. It's simply the higher of the two sentiment scores.\n*   **Formula**: `sentiment_intensity = max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)`\n*   **Interpretation**: A higher value indicates a stronger emotional expression overall, whether positive or negative.\n\n---\n\n### Execution Results\n\n```\n--- Input Dimensional Scores ---\n{\n  \"positive_sentiment\": 0.0,\n  \"negative_sentiment\": 1.0\n}\n\n\n--- Calculated Derived Metrics ---\nMetric: overall_sentiment_polarity\n  Value: -1.0000\n  Description: Overall sentiment polarity (Positive - Negative).
