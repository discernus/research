  "derived_metrics": "Here are some derived metrics calculated from the provided dimensional scores:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_sentiment_score\": 0.95,\n  \"sentiment_extremity\": 0.95,\n  \"sentiment_balance\": 0.0,\n  \"is_positive\": true,\n  \"is_negative\": false,\n  \"is_neutral\": false\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Derived Metrics:**\n\n*   **`overall_sentiment_score`**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **Rationale**: Given the binary nature of the framework (minimalist, test-focused), the overall sentiment can be represented by the dominant sentiment score. In this case, positive sentiment is dominant.\n\n*   **`sentiment_extremity`**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **Rationale**: This metric indicates how strong the detected sentiment is, regardless of its direction. A score closer to 1.0 means a very strong sentiment (either positive or negative), while a score closer to 0.0 indicates a very weak or absent sentiment. In this case, the high positive score makes the sentiment quite extreme.\n\n*   **`sentiment_balance`**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment`\n    *   **Rationale**: This metric provides a direct measure of the balance between positive and negative sentiment. A positive value indicates a dominance of positive sentiment, a negative value indicates a dominance of negative sentiment, and a value close to zero suggests a neutral or mixed sentiment. Here, the balance is strongly positive.\n\n*   **`is_positive`**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment > 0.5 AND positive_sentiment > negative_sentiment`\n    *   **Rationale**: A boolean flag indicating whether the overall sentiment is predominantly positive.\n\n*   **`is_negative`**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `negative_sentiment > 0.5 AND negative_sentiment > positive_sentiment`\n    *   **Rationale**: A boolean flag indicating whether the overall sentiment is predominantly negative.\n\n*   **`is_neutral`**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment) <= 0.2` (Threshold of 0.2 is a common convention for neutrality, but can be adjusted).\n    *   **Rationale**: A boolean flag indicating whether the sentiment is roughly balanced between positive and negative, leaning towards neutral. In this specific case, with a large difference, it's clearly not neutral.",
