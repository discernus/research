  "marked_up_document": "The proposed industrial zoning changes represent a <negative_sentiment>catastrophic betrayal</negative_sentiment> of public trust and an <negative_sentiment>assault</negative_sentiment> on our community's well-being. The plan, drafted with no meaningful public consultation, <negative_sentiment>threatens to decimate</negative_sentiment> protected wetlands and <negative_sentiment>irrevocably poison</negative_sentiment> our local water supply with industrial runoff. Residents are rightfully <negative_sentiment>outraged</negative_sentiment>, <negative_sentiment>fearing</negative_sentiment> the long-term health consequences and the <negative_sentiment>destruction</negative_sentiment> of the natural landscapes that define our town's character. This is not progress; it is a <negative_sentiment>reckless, shortsighted capitulation</negative_sentiment> to corporate interests over human lives.\n\nThe complete <negative_sentiment>lack of transparency</negative_sentiment> and the <negative_sentiment>dismissive attitude</negative_sentiment> from officials have only <negative_sentiment>fueled the growing sense of despair and anger</negative_sentiment>. Community meetings have been little more than performative gestures, with legitimate concerns <negative_sentiment>brushed aside</negative_sentiment> and expert warnings <negative_sentiment>ignored</negative_sentiment>. The entire process has been a masterclass in <negative_sentiment>bureaucratic arrogance</negative_sentiment>, leaving citizens feeling <negative_sentiment>powerless and unheard</negative_sentiment>. This policy is a <negative_sentiment>festering wound</negative_sentiment> that will undoubtedly lead to years of <negative_sentiment>environmental degradation</negative_sentiment> and <negative_sentiment>legal battles</negative_sentiment>, leaving a <negative_sentiment>permanent scar</negative_sentiment> on our town.",
