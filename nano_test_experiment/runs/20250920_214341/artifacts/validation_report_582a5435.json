      "description": "The corpus manifest `corpus.md` specifies `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, but the current active standard is v8.0.2. While the v8.0 format is forward-compatible for this simple experiment, using the latest patch version is best practice for clarity and to ensure access to all features defined in the current standard, such as custom analytical groupings.",
      "impact": "This does not block the current execution, as the experiment does not use features introduced after v8.0. However, it is out of compliance with the latest patch version of the specification and could cause validation failures in more complex experiments requiring newer features.",
      "fix": "Update the `spec_version` field in the YAML block of `corpus.md` from `\"8.0\"` to `\"8.0.2\"`.",
