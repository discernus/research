      "description": "The corpus manifest `spec_version` is declared as \"8.0\", but the manifest content uses nested file paths (e.g., \"corpus/positive_test.txt\"), a feature introduced in the v8.0.1 specification. The declared version does not match the features used.",
      "impact": "While not blocking execution in this instance, this inconsistency can lead to validation failures or unexpected behavior on future platform versions with stricter compliance checks. It misrepresents the technical standard the corpus adheres to.",
      "fix": "Update the `spec_version` field in `corpus.md` to at least \"8.0.1\" (or the current standard \"8.0.2\") to accurately reflect the use of nested directory paths.",

      "description": "The `analysis_prompt` in the framework is minimal and does not follow the v10.0 specification's best practices for LLM agent interaction. It lacks an expert persona definition, theoretical context, and other recommended contextual guidance.",
      "impact": "The analysis may be less reliable or consistent, as the LLM agent lacks the rich contextual framing that the v10.0 spec recommends for producing high-quality, repeatable results, even for simple tasks.",
      "fix": "Enhance the `analysis_prompt` in `sentiment_binary_v1.md` to align with the v10.0 spec template. Include an expert persona (e.g., \"You are an expert sentiment analyst...\") and a brief overview of the analytical methodology.",

      "description": "The `markers` for each dimension use simple string lists. The Framework v10.0 specification recommends an enhanced object structure (e.g., `{phrase: \"...\", explanation: \"...\"}`) to provide superior context to the LLM agent.",
      "impact": "Using simple string lists may reduce the agent's accuracy, as it lacks the explanatory context for why a specific phrase is a valid indicator, potentially leading to misinterpretation of ambiguous terms.",
      "fix": "In `sentiment_binary_v1.md`, convert the `markers` from arrays of strings to arrays of objects, where each object contains a `phrase` and an `explanation` key, as detailed in the \"Advanced Markers Structure\" best practice section of the v10.0 Framework spec.",
