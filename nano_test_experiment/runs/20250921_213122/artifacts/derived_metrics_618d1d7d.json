If we assume 0.0 is no presence and 1.0 is max presence,\n# then positive_sentiment (0.1) means a low presence of positive.\n# If we want a single score, we can think of positive as +1 and negative as -1.\n# A simple approach to get a single sentiment score on a -1 to 1 scale:\n# If positive > negative, the sentiment is positive. If negative > positive, the sentiment is negative.\n# The magnitude can be derived from the difference.\n\n# Example: If positive = 0.9 and negative = 0.1, overall sentiment is strongly positive.\n# If positive = 0.1 and negative = 0.9, overall sentiment is strongly negative.\n# If positive = 0.5 and negative = 0.5, overall sentiment is neutral.\n\n# A common way to represent this is: (pos_score - neg_score) / (pos_score + neg_score)\n# This normalizes the difference by the total sentiment expressed.\n# Handle the case where both are 0 to avoid division by zero.\ntotal_sentiment_expressed = scores[\"positive_sentiment\"] + scores[\"negative_sentiment\"]\nif total_sentiment_expressed == 0:\n    balanced_sentiment = 0.0\nelse:\n    balanced_sentiment = (scores[\"positive_sentiment\"] - scores[\"negative_sentiment\"]) / total_sentiment_expressed\n\n# Alternatively, a simpler approach: just the difference, scaled.\n# We want a score that is positive if positive sentiment is dominant, negative if negative is dominant.\n# The range of (pos_score - neg_score) is [-1, 1].\n# If pos=1, neg=0 -> diff=1 (max pos)\n# If pos=0, neg=1 -> diff=-1 (max neg)\n# If pos=0.5, neg=0.5 -> diff=0 (neutral)\n# If pos=0.1, neg=0.97 -> diff = 0.1 - 0.97 = -0.97 (very negative)\n\n# Let's use the simple difference scaled to [-1, 1] as it directly reflects dominance.\nsentiment_difference = scores[\"positive_sentiment\"] - scores[\"negative_sentiment\"]\n\n\nresults = {\n    \"sentiment_difference\": sentiment_difference,\n    \"balanced_sentiment\": balanced_sentiment\n}\n```\n```json\n{\"results\":{\"sentiment_difference\":-0.87,\"balanced_sentiment\":-0.8349514563109243}}\n```",
