As a statistical analysis expert, I will provide a comprehensive analysis of the provided dimensional scores.\n\nGiven the extremely small sample size (N=2), it's important to note that while we can calculate descriptive statistics and correlation, any inferential statistics (like p-values) will not be meaningful. The primary value of this analysis is to demonstrate a robust analytical process that can be applied to a larger dataset in the future.\n\nHere is the complete analysis, including the Python code, its execution, and a detailed interpretation of the findings.\n\n***\n\n### **Python Code for Statistical Analysis**\n\nThis script performs the requested statistical analysis on the provided score data. It uses `pandas` for data manipulation, `scipy.stats` for statistical calculations, and `matplotlib` with `seaborn` for visualizations.\n\n```python\n#\n# Statistical Analysis of Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0 Scores\n#\n\n# 1.

Descriptive Statistics**\n\nThe analysis covers two dimensions: `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`.\n\n*   **Positive Sentiment**: The scores were `1.0` and `0.1`. This results in a mean score of **0.55** with a standard deviation of 0.64. The wide range and high standard deviation indicate high variability between the two documents, with one being scored as maximally positive and the other as minimally positive.\n*   **Negative Sentiment**: The scores were `0.0` and `0.97`. This results in a mean score of **0.485** with a standard deviation of 0.69. Similar to positive sentiment, this shows extreme divergence between the two documents.\n\n#### **2. Correlation Analysis**\n\nA Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` dimensions.\n\n*   The analysis found a **perfect negative correlation (r = -1.0)**.\n*   **Interpretation**: This result indicates that as the `positive_sentiment` score increases, the `negative_sentiment` score decreases in a perfectly linear fashion. This is visually confirmed by the scatter plot, where the two data points form a straight, downward-sloping line. This finding aligns with the theoretical expectation of the framework, where positive and negative sentiment are opposing constructs.\n\n#### **3. Statistical Significance**\n\n*   The p-value associated with the correlation was calculated as `nan` (Not a Number), which in this context implies it is undefined or statistically meaningless.\n*   **Crucial Limitation**: With a sample size of only two data points (N=2), any correlation will mathematically be either +1.0 or -1.0 (unless the points are perfectly aligned horizontally or vertically). Therefore, the perfect correlation observed here is an artifact of the small sample size, not a statistically significant finding. **No conclusion about a general relationship between these dimensions can be drawn from this data.**\n\n#### **4. Summary and Recommendations**\n\n*   **Key Observation**: The analysis successfully demonstrates a process for quantifying and exploring the relationships within the sentiment framework. Descriptively, the two documents analyzed represent opposite ends of the sentiment spectrum, with one being purely positive and the other almost purely negative.\n*   **Core Limitation**: The primary limitation is the sample size of N=2. This prevents any meaningful statistical inference or generalization. The results are purely descriptive of the two specific data points provided.\n*   **Recommendation**: To validate the framework's behavior and draw statistically significant conclusions, it is essential to **collect a much larger dataset**. A sample size of at least 30-50 would be a good starting point for more reliable correlation analysis and significance testing. The provided Python script is robust and can be immediately reused on a larger dataset to produce meaningful results.",
