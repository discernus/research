  "derived_metrics": "Here are some derived metrics that can be calculated from the provided dimensional scores, along with their JSON representation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sentiment_extremity\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 1.0,\n    \"salience\": 1.0,\n    \"confidence\": 1.0,\n    \"evidence\": \"The sentiment is highly polarized with a strong positive score and no negative score.\"\n  },\n  \"sentiment_neutrality\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n    \"salience\": 0.0,\n    \"confidence\": 1.0,\n    \"evidence\": \"The sentiment leans strongly positive, indicating very low neutrality.\"\n  },\n  \"net_sentiment\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 1.0,\n    \"salience\": 1.0,\n    \"confidence\": 1.0,\n    \"evidence\": \"Positive sentiment score (1.0) minus negative sentiment score (0.0) results in a strong net positive sentiment.\"\n  },\n  \"sentiment_ratio\": {\n    \"raw_score\": 1.0,\n    \"salience\": 1.0,\n    \"confidence\": 1.0,\n    \"evidence\": \"The ratio of positive sentiment (1.0) to negative sentiment (0.0) is undefined or infinitely positive, indicating a strong positive dominance.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Derived Metrics:**\n\n1.  **Sentiment Extremity:**\n    *   **Calculation:** `max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **Purpose:** Measures how strong the sentiment is in either direction, regardless of whether it's positive or negative. A higher score indicates a more polarized sentiment.\n\n2.  **Sentiment Neutrality:**\n    *   **Calculation:** `1 - abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment)` OR `1 - max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)` (depending on interpretation, here using `1 - max` as a simple way to show distance from extremes). A simpler, common approach is `1 - abs(positive - negative)`. Let's use `1 - abs(positive - negative)` for this example.\n    *   **Calculation (Revised):** `1 - abs(1.0 - 0.0)` = `1 - 1.0` = `0.0`\n    *   **Purpose:** Measures how close the sentiment is to being neutral. A score of 1.0 would mean equal positive and negative sentiment (or both zero), while a score of 0.0 means the sentiment is entirely one-sided.\n\n3.  **Net Sentiment:**\n    *   **Calculation:** `positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment`\n    *   **Purpose:** Provides a single score indicating the overall sentiment balance. A positive score indicates net positive sentiment, a negative score indicates net negative sentiment, and zero indicates a neutral balance.\n\n4.  **Sentiment Ratio:**\n    *   **Calculation:** `positive_sentiment / (negative_sentiment + epsilon)` (where epsilon is a small number to avoid division by zero, e.g., 0.0001). For this specific case, division by zero would occur. A more robust approach might be to use a log-ratio or consider it as \"infinitely positive\" if negative is zero. For simplicity in this example, we'll describe it.\n    *   **Calculation (Descriptive):** With `positive_sentiment = 1.0` and `negative_sentiment = 0.0`, the ratio is effectively \"infinite\" or highly positive, indicating a dominant positive sentiment.\n    *   **Purpose:** Shows the relative strength of positive sentiment compared to negative sentiment. A ratio greater than 1 indicates more positive than negative, and less than 1 indicates more negative than positive.\n\nThese derived metrics offer additional insights into the sentiment expressed in the text, building upon the foundational positive and negative scores.",
