  "derived_metrics": "Here are some derived metrics from the provided dimensional scores, along with their definitions and calculations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_sentiment_score\": {\n    \"value\": -1.0,\n    \"description\": \"A single score representing the overall sentiment, calculated as (Positive Sentiment - Negative Sentiment). Ranges from -1.0 (highly negative) to 1.0 (highly positive).\"\n  },\n  \"sentiment_intensity\": {\n    \"value\": 1.0,\n    \"description\": \"Measures the overall strength of sentiment, regardless of direction. Calculated as the maximum of Positive Sentiment and Negative Sentiment. Ranges from 0.0 (neutral) to 1.0 (very strong sentiment).\"\n  },\n  \"sentiment_neutrality\": {\n    \"value\": 0.0,\n    \"description\": \"Measures how neutral the sentiment is. Calculated as 1 - (Absolute difference between Positive Sentiment and Negative Sentiment). Ranges from 0.0 (highly polarized) to 1.0 (perfectly neutral).\"\n  },\n  \"sentiment_balance\": {\n    \"value\": 0.0,\n    \"description\": \"Indicates the balance between positive and negative sentiment. Calculated as Positive Sentiment / (Positive Sentiment + Negative Sentiment), with a small epsilon to avoid division by zero. Ranges from 0.0 (all negative) to 1.0 (all positive).\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Derived Metrics:**\n\n1.  **`overall_sentiment_score`**:\n    *   **Description**: This is a common way to represent overall sentiment. A positive score indicates more positive sentiment, a negative score indicates more negative sentiment, and zero would indicate a balance or absence of sentiment.\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment`\n    *   **In this case**: `0.0 - 1.0 = -1.0`\n\n2.  **`sentiment_intensity`**:\n    *   **Description**: This metric captures how strongly the text expresses sentiment, irrespective of whether it's positive or negative. A high intensity means there's a lot of emotional language present.\n    *   **Calculation**: `max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **In this case**: `max(0.0, 1.0) = 1.0`\n\n3.  **`sentiment_neutrality`**:\n    *   **Description**: This metric measures how close the text is to a neutral sentiment. A high score indicates a balanced or absence of strong sentiment, while a low score means the sentiment is heavily skewed in one direction.\n    *   **Calculation**: `1 - abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **In this case**: `1 - abs(0.0 - 1.0) = 1 - 1.0 = 0.0`\n\n4.  **`sentiment_balance`**:\n    *   **Description**: This metric aims to show the proportion of positive sentiment relative to the total sentiment expressed. It's useful for understanding the composition of the sentiment. We add a small epsilon (e.g., 0.0001) to the denominator to prevent division by zero if both scores are 0.\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment / (positive_sentiment + negative_sentiment + 0.0001)`\n    *   **In this case**: `0.0 / (0.0 + 1.0 + 0.0001) = 0.0 / 1.0001 = 0.0`",
