A positive value indicates a leaning towards positive sentiment, a negative value towards negative sentiment, and zero indicates neutrality or equal presence of both.\n    *   Example: If `positive=0.8` and `negative=0.2`, polarity = `0.6` (net positive). If `positive=0.2` and `negative=0.8`, polarity = `-0.6` (net negative).\n    *   **Result for input:** `0.0 - 1.0 = -1.0` (Strongly negative polarity).\n\n2.  **sentiment_intensity:**\n    *   Calculation: `max(abs(positive_sentiment), abs(negative_sentiment))`\n    *   Interpretation: Represents the strength of the expressed emotion, regardless of direction. A higher score indicates more pronounced emotional language.\n    *   Example: If `positive=0.9` and `negative=0.1`, intensity = `0.9`. If `positive=0.1` and `negative=0.9`, intensity = `0.9`. If `positive=0.5` and `negative=0.5`, intensity = `0.5`.\n    *   **Result for input:** `max(abs(0.0), abs(1.0)) = max(0.0, 1.0) = 1.0` (Maximum intensity).\n\n3.  **dominant_sentiment:**\n    *   Calculation: Compares `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`.\n    *   Interpretation: Identifies which sentiment dimension has a higher score. This is a categorical representation of the primary emotional tone.\n    *   Example: If `positive=0.7` and `negative=0.3`, dominant is 'positive'. If `positive=0.3` and `negative=0.7`, dominant is 'negative'. If `positive=0.5` and `negative=0.5`, dominant is 'neutral'.\n    *   **Result for input:** `0.0` is not greater than `1.0`, so the dominant sentiment is 'negative'.\n\n4.  **average_sentiment_expression:**\n    *   Calculation: `(positive_sentiment + negative_sentiment) / 2.0`\n    *   Interpretation: Provides a measure of the average emotional expression. It indicates how much 'active' sentiment (either positive or negative) is present on average. A score of `1.0` would mean both positive and negative scores are `1.0`, indicating very strong presence of both. A score of `0.0` would mean both are `0.0`.\n    *   Example: If `positive=0.8` and `negative=0.2`, average = `(0.8+0.2)/2 = 0.5`. If `positive=0.1` and `negative=0.1`, average = `(0.1+0.1)/2 = 0.1`. If `positive=1.0` and `negative=1.0`, average = `(1.0+1.0)/2 = 1.0`.\n    *   **Result for input:** `(0.0 + 1.0) / 2.0 = 0.5` (Moderate average expression, driven by the strong negative score).",
