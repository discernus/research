While these are fundamental, we can derive several meaningful metrics to gain a more nuanced understanding of the text's emotional content. The Python code calculates the following derived metrics:\n\n1.  **`overall_sentiment_polarity`**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment`\n    *   **Interpretation**: This is a straightforward way to determine the net sentiment. A score of `1.0` (as in the example) clearly indicates a strongly positive sentiment, with no negative sentiment present. A score of `-1.0` would indicate strongly negative sentiment, and a score near `0.0` would suggest a neutral or mixed sentiment.\n\n2.  **`sentiment_dominance`**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment) / (positive_sentiment + negative_sentiment)` (handling division by zero).\n    *   **Interpretation**: This metric quantifies how much one sentiment outweighs the other. A value of `1.0` means one sentiment is present at its maximum (1.0) and the other is absent (0.0), indicating complete dominance. A value of `0.0` would mean `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` are equal (e.g., both 0.5, or both 0.0). In the given example, with `positive_sentiment = 1.0` and `negative_sentiment = 0.0`, the dominance is `abs(1.0 - 0.0) / (1.0 + 0.0) = 1.0 / 1.0 = 1.0`, signifying maximum dominance of positive sentiment.\n\n3.  **`neutrality_score`**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `1.0 - sentiment_dominance`\n    *   **Interpretation**: This metric is the inverse of sentiment dominance. It measures how close the sentiment is to being balanced or neutral. A score of `0.0` (as in the example) implies that the sentiment is far from neutral and is strongly skewed towards one polarity. A score closer to `1.0` would indicate a more balanced or neutral sentiment.\n\n4.  **`sentiment_intensity`**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment + negative_sentiment`\n    *   **Interpretation**: This metric captures the overall \"energy\" or emotional strength of the text, irrespective of whether it's positive or negative. A higher score indicates that the text contains more emotional language overall. In the example, a score of `1.0` suggests a high level of emotional expression, entirely within the positive domain.\n\nThese derived metrics provide additional layers of analysis, allowing users to quickly assess the overall sentiment, the clarity of the emotional leaning, and the intensity of emotional expression within a text, all built upon the foundational positive and negative sentiment scores.",
