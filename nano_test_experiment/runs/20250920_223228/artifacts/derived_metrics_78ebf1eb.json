  "derived_metrics": "Here are some derived metrics based on the provided dimensional scores and framework:\n\n1.  **Overall Sentiment Polarity:** This metric indicates the dominant sentiment of the text. It can be calculated by subtracting the negative sentiment score from the positive sentiment score.\n\n    *   **Formula:** `Overall Sentiment Polarity = positive_sentiment.raw_score - negative_sentiment.raw_score`\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   A score close to 1.0 indicates strongly positive sentiment.\n        *   A score close to -1.0 indicates strongly negative sentiment.\n        *   A score close to 0.0 indicates neutral or mixed sentiment.\n\n2.  **Sentiment Intensity:** This metric represents the overall strength of sentiment, regardless of polarity. It can be calculated by taking the maximum of the positive and negative sentiment scores.\n\n    *   **Formula:** `Sentiment Intensity = max(positive_sentiment.raw_score, negative_sentiment.raw_score)`\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   A score closer to 1.0 suggests a text with strong emotional content (either positive or negative).\n        *   A score closer to 0.0 suggests a text with weak or no discernible emotional content.\n\n3.  **Sentiment Balance:** This metric measures how balanced the positive and negative sentiments are within the text. It can be calculated by summing the two sentiment scores.\n\n    *   **Formula:** `Sentiment Balance = positive_sentiment.raw_score + negative_sentiment.raw_score`\n    *   **Interpretation:**\n        *   A score closer to 2.0 indicates a text with both strong positive and strong negative sentiment (highly mixed).\n        *   A score closer to 0.0 indicates a text with very little sentiment (either positive or negative).\n        *   A score around 1.0 could indicate moderate positive or moderate negative sentiment, or a balance between weak positive and weak negative.\n\nHere's the JSON output with these derived metrics calculated for the provided scores:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"derived_metrics\": {\n    \"overall_sentiment_polarity\": 0.98,\n    \"sentiment_intensity\": 0.98,\n    \"sentiment_balance\": 0.98\n  }\n}\n```",
