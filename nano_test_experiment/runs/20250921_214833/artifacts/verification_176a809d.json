The overall_sentiment was calculated as 1.0 - 0.0 = 1.0. The sentiment_intensity was 1.0 + 0.0 = 1.0. The sentiment_purity was determined to be 1.0 as the condition (1.0 > 0.7 and 0.0 < 0.3) was met. The dominant_sentiment_strength was max(1.0, 0.0) = 1.0. All calculated results match the provided JSON object.",
