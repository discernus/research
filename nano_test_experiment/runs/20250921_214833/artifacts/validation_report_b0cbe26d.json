      "description": "The corpus contains only 2 documents (N=2), which is below the threshold for any form of statistical analysis. The experiment's design supports only direct qualitative comparison of the two documents.",
      "impact": "No statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) can be performed. The results are valid only for pipeline functional validation and qualitative observation, not for generalizable research conclusions.",
      "fix": "This is not an error given the experiment's stated goal of 'minimal pipeline validation'. If statistical analysis were a goal, the corpus would need to be significantly expanded (e.g., N > 10 for descriptive statistics, N > 30 for inferential statistics).",
