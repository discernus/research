As a statistical analysis expert, I will provide a comprehensive analysis of the provided dimensional scores.\n\n### **Executive Summary**\n\nThe analysis of the two provided data points from the \"Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0\" was performed. The dataset, while extremely small, is sufficient to demonstrate the analytical process.\n\n*   **Descriptive Statistics**: The data consists of two opposing scores: one maximally positive (`positive_sentiment`: 1.0, `negative_sentiment`: 0.0) and one maximally negative (`positive_sentiment`: 0.0, `negative_sentiment`: 1.0).\n*   **Correlation Analysis**: A perfect negative correlation (r = -1.0) exists between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`. This is visually confirmed with a scatter plot.\n*   **Significance Testing**: Standard statistical significance testing is not meaningful for a sample size of two. The degrees of freedom are zero, which makes p-value calculation impossible or invalid. This result is expected, as the provided data is likely intended to represent two extreme, opposing test cases.\n\n**Conclusion**: The analysis reveals a perfect inverse relationship between the positive and negative sentiment dimensions within the provided sample. This suggests the scoring model is behaving as expected for polar opposite inputs. However, due to the minimal sample size, no broader conclusions can be drawn about the framework's behavior on more nuanced data. To perform a robust validation, a larger and more varied dataset is essential.\n\nBelow is the Python code, its execution, and a detailed interpretation of the findings.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code for Statistical Analysis**\n\nHere is the complete, executable Python script to perform the requested analysis.
