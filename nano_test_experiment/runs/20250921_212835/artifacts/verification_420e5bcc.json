  "reasoning": "The Python code was re-executed to verify the calculations. Given the initial scores of positive_sentiment=0.0 and negative_sentiment=1.0, the calculated results are: sentiment_polarity = -1.0, sentiment_intensity = 1.0, net_sentiment = -1.0, and sentiment_ratio = 0.0. These re-calculated values exactly match the provided JSON data. Therefore, the mathematical logic is sound and the results are verified as correct.",
