  "marked_up_document": "The proposed industrial zoning changes represent a **<span style=\"color:red\">catastrophic betrayal of public trust and an assault on our community's well-being.</span>** The plan, drafted with no meaningful public consultation, threatens to **<span style=\"color:red\">decimate protected wetlands and irrevocably poison our local water supply with industrial runoff.</span>** Residents are **<span style=\"color:red\">rightfully outraged</span>**, **<span style=\"color:red\">fearing the long-term health consequences and the destruction of the natural landscapes</span>** that define our town's character. This is **<span style=\"color:red\">not progress</span>**; it is a **<span style=\"color:red\">reckless, shortsighted capitulation to corporate interests over human lives.</span>**\n\nThe complete **<span style=\"color:red\">lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude from officials have only fueled the growing sense of despair and anger.</span>** Community meetings have been **<span style=\"color:red\">little more than performative gestures</span>**, with **<span style=\"color:red\">legitimate concerns brushed aside and expert warnings ignored.</span>** The entire process has been a **<span style=\"color:red\">masterclass in bureaucratic arrogance, leaving citizens feeling powerless and unheard.</span>** This policy is a **<span style=\"color:red\">festering wound that will undoubtedly lead to years of environmental degradation and legal battles, leaving a permanent scar on our town.</span>**\n\nThe environmental impact assessment was **<span style=\"color:red\">deliberately rushed and incomplete, with critical data omitted and independent studies suppressed.</span>** The developers' promises of <span style=\"color:green\">job creation</span> ring **<span style=\"color:red\">hollow</span>** when weighed against the **<span style=\"color:red\">irreversible damage to our ecosystem.</span>** Local businesses that depend on tourism and outdoor recreation will be **<span style=\"color:red\">devastvated</span>**, while the promised <span style=\"color:green\">economic benefits</span> remain **<span style=\"color:red\">speculative at best.</span>** The community's **<span style=\"color:red\">deep-seated anger is justified and growing stronger with each passing day.</span>**\n\nThe mayor's **<span style=\"color:red\">dismissive comments about \"NIMBYism\" reveal a fundamental contempt for democratic participation and environmental stewardship.</span>** These wetlands have been protected for decades for good reason - they filter our water, provide flood control, and support diverse wildlife. The proposed industrial complex will **<span style=\"color:red\">destroy this irreplaceable natural heritage</span>** while **<span style=\"color:red\">enriching a handful of developers and their political allies.</span>** The **<span style=\"color:red\">betrayal is complete and unforgivable.</span>**\n\nResidents have organized peaceful protests, circulated petitions, and engaged in every available democratic channel, only to be met with **<span style=\"color:red\">stonewalling and condescension.</span>** The planning commission's **<span style=\"color:red\">rubber-stamp approval process has been a sham from the beginning</span>**, with **<span style=\"color:red\">public input treated as a mere formality.</span>** The environmental groups' **<span style=\"color:red\">warnings about water contamination and habitat destruction have been systematically ignored</span>**, while the developers' lobbyists have enjoyed unprecedented access to decision-makers.\n\nThe long-term consequences of this decision will be **<span style=\"color:red\">devastating and irreversible.</span>** Once the wetlands are destroyed and the industrial complex is built, there will be **<span style=\"color:red\">no going back.</span>** Our children and grandchildren will inherit a **<span style=\"color:red\">degraded environment, contaminated water, and a community that has lost its natural character.</span>** The short-term <span style=\"color:green\">economic gains</span> for a few will be **<span style=\"color:red\">dwarfed by the long-term costs borne by everyone.</span>** This is **<span style=\"color:red\">not just bad policy - it is a moral failure that will haunt our community for generations.</span>**\n\nThe growing coalition of concerned citizens, environmental activists, and local business owners represents the true voice of our community. We will not be **<span style=\"color:red\">silenced or dismissed.</span>** The fight to protect our wetlands and preserve our town's character is far from over. We will use every legal means available to challenge this decision and hold accountable those who have **<span style=\"color:red\">betrayed the public trust.</span>** The **<span style=\"color:red\">environmental damage, economic devastation, and social division</span>** caused by this **<span style=\"color:red\">reckless policy will not be forgotten.</span>**\n\nThe developers' claims about <span style=\"color:green\">environmental safeguards</span> are **<span style=\"color:red\">laughable</span>** given their track record of **<span style=\"color:red\">violations and cost-cutting measures.</span>** The promised \"<span style=\"color:green\">green technology</span>\" is **<span style=\"color:red\">nothing more than window dressing</span>** designed to placate concerned citizens. The real environmental impact will be **<span style=\"color:red\">catastrophic, with toxic runoff contaminating our water supply and destroying the delicate wetland ecosystem.</span>** The community's **<span style=\"color:red\">anger and determination to fight this decision are completely justified and will only grow stronger</span>** as the **<span style=\"color:red\">true costs become apparent.</span>**\n\nThis industrial zoning change represents **<span style=\"color:red\">everything that is wrong with our current political system - corporate influence over public interest, environmental destruction for short-term profit, and the systematic disenfranchisement of ordinary citizens.</span>** The developers' promises of <span style=\"color:green\">economic prosperity</span> are **<span style=\"color:red\">empty</span>**, while the environmental and social costs are **<span style=\"color:red\">real and permanent.</span>** We must stand together to protect our community, our environment, and our democratic values from this **<span style=\"color:red\">assault on everything we hold dear.</span>**",
