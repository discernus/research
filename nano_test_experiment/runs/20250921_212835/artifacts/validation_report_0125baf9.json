      "description": "The corpus contains only two documents (N=2). This sample size is suitable for the stated goals of pipeline validation and comparative case analysis, but it is insufficient for any form of inferential statistical analysis (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA).",
      "impact": "Analysis will be limited to descriptive and qualitative comparisons. The results cannot be used to make statistically significant claims or generalizations.",
      "fix": "No fix is required as the experiment's goal is pipeline validation. If inferential statistical analysis were desired, the corpus size would need to be increased significantly (e.g., N>=10 for descriptive statistics, N>=30 for robust inferential tests).",
