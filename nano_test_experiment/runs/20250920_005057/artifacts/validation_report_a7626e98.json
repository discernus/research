      "impact": "Reduces the scholarly credibility and reusability of the framework. Fails to meet the quality standards for intellectual artifacts on the platform, even for simple test cases.",
      "fix": "In the human-readable section of `sentiment_binary_v1.md`, add a subsection under 'Theoretical Foundations' with a brief discussion of the literature and citations to foundational work in sentiment analysis.",
