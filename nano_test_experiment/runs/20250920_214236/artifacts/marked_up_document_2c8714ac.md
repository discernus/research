  "marked_up_document": "The proposed industrial zoning changes represent a <negative>catastrophic betrayal of public trust</negative> and an <negative>assault on our community's well-being</negative>. The plan, drafted with <negative>no meaningful public consultation</negative>, <negative>threatens to decimate protected wetlands</negative> and <negative>irrevocably poison our local water supply</negative> with industrial runoff. Residents are <negative>rightfully outraged</negative>, <negative>fearing the long-term health consequences</negative> and the <negative>destruction of the natural landscapes</negative> that define our town's character. This is <negative>not progress</negative>; it is a <negative>reckless, shortsighted capitulation to corporate interests over human lives</negative>.\n\nThe <negative>complete lack of transparency</negative> and the <negative>dismissive attitude from officials</negative> have only fueled the <negative>growing sense of despair and anger</negative>. Community meetings have been little more than <negative>performative gestures</negative>, with <negative>legitimate concerns brushed aside</negative> and <negative>expert warnings ignored</negative>. The entire process has been a <negative>masterclass in bureaucratic arrogance</negative>, leaving citizens <negative>feeling powerless and unheard</negative>. This policy is a <negative>festering wound</negative> that will undoubtedly lead to <negative>years of environmental degradation</negative> and <negative>legal battles</negative>, leaving a <negative>permanent scar on our town</negative>.",
