    "The 'sentiment_binary_v1.md' framework uses a simple list of strings for its dimensional markers. The Framework v10.0 specification recommends an enhanced object structure (e.g., `{phrase: '...', explanation: '...'}`) to provide superior context to the analysis agent, which can improve accuracy and consistency. Consider adopting this richer format for improved reliability, as detailed in the 'Advanced Markers Structure' best practice."
