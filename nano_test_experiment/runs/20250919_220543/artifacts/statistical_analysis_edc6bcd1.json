Due to the extremely small sample size (N=2), the analysis is classified as **TIER 3 (Exploratory)**. All statistical methods have been adapted accordingly, focusing on descriptive statistics and direct comparisons rather than inferential testing, which would be invalid.\n\nThe analysis successfully confirms that the sentiment scoring aligns with the intended sentiment of the test documents. The 'positive' document received a high `positive_sentiment` score, and the 'negative' document received a high `negative_sentiment` score, demonstrating the basic functionality of the analysis pipeline.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"statistical_functions\": \"import pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport scipy.stats as stats\\nimport pingouin as pg\\nfrom typing import Dict, Any, Optional, List\\nimport json\\nimport re\\n\\n# --- Data Preparation Utility ---\\n\\ndef _clean_json_string(s: str) -> str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Removes leading/trailing code fences and extraneous text from a JSON string.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    match = re.search(r'```(json)?\\\\n(.*?)\\\\n```', s, re.DOTALL)\\n    if match:\\n        return match.group(2).strip()\\n    return s.strip()\\n\\ndef _create_data_frame(data: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Optional[pd.DataFrame]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Parses analysis artifacts and corpus manifest to create a unified DataFrame.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        data (List[Dict[str, Any]]): A list of analysis artifact dictionaries.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        Optional[pd.DataFrame]: A DataFrame with scores and metadata, or None if parsing fails.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    try:\\n        # 1.
