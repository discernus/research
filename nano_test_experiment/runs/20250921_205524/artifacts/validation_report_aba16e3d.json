      "description": "The scoring bands defined in the `analysis_prompt` differ from the bands in the structured `scoring_calibration` section for both dimensions. For example, the prompt specifies '0.9-1.0: Dominant' and '0.7-0.8: Strong', while the `scoring_calibration` defines 'high: \"0.7-1.0: Strong positive presence\"'.",
      "impact": "This provides conflicting guidance to the analysis agent, which may lead to less predictable or consistent scoring as the agent might prioritize one set of instructions over the other.",
      "fix": "Harmonize the scoring bands and their descriptions across both the `analysis_prompt` and the `scoring_calibration` sections within the framework file to ensure a single, unambiguous source of truth for the agent.",
