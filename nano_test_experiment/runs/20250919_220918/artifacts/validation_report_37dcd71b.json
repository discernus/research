While the experiment is functional, using an outdated specification version can lead to compatibility issues with newer platform features, such as the requirement for custom analytical groupings in statistical analyses.",
      "impact": "The experiment will run correctly, but it is not compliant with the latest corpus specification. Future experiments requiring advanced features introduced after v8.0 might fail if this corpus is reused without updates.",

      "description": "The framework `sentiment_binary_v1.md` has a minimal 'Theoretical Foundations' section that lacks citations. The v10.0 framework specification requires this section to provide scholarly grounding for the analytical approach by discussing and citing relevant existing research.",
      "impact": "The framework is executable for this simple test case, but its intellectual credibility and reusability by other researchers are diminished. It does not fully meet the standard of being a self-contained scholarly artifact as defined by the v10.0 specification.",
      "fix": "Expand the 'Theoretical Foundations' section to briefly discuss the sentiment analysis theory it is based on and add citations to relevant academic literature or prior research.",
