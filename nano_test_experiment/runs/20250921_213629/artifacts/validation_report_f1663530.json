      "description": "The corpus contains only 2 documents (N=2). This sample size is too small for any inferential statistical analysis (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) or robust correlational analysis.",
      "impact": "The experiment's findings will be limited to a direct comparative case analysis of the two documents. No generalizable statistical conclusions can be drawn. This is consistent with the stated goals of the experiment but precludes the use of most automated statistical agents.",
      "fix": "For the stated goal of a minimal pipeline validation, this sample size is acceptable. If broader statistical claims were desired, the corpus would need to be expanded to meet the minimum sample size requirements outlined in the v10.0 experiment specification (e.g., N>=10 for descriptive statistics, N>=20 for limited inferential testing).",
