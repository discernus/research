  "reasoning": "The Python code was re-executed to recalculate the sentiment metrics. The input scores were positive_sentiment=1.0 and negative_sentiment=0.0. The derived metrics were calculated as follows: sentiment_polarity (1.0 - 0.0 = 1.0), sentiment_intensity (1.0 + 0.0 = 1.0), is_positive (1.0 > 0.0 = 1.0), is_negative (0.0 > 1.0 = 0.0), and is_neutral (1.0 == 0.0 = 0.0). The calculated results match the provided JSON object exactly.",
