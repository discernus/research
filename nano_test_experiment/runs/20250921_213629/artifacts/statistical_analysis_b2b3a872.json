As a statistical analysis expert, I will provide a comprehensive analysis of the provided dimensional scores.\n\nHere is the Python code, execution, results, and interpretation.\n\n### **Statistical Analysis Report: Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0**\n\n---\n\n### **1. Introduction & Setup**\n\nThis report details the statistical analysis of two dimensional scores generated by the \"Sentiment Binary v1.0\" framework. The analysis will cover descriptive statistics, the relationship between the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` dimensions, and the statistical significance of these findings.\n\nA critical preliminary observation is the extremely small sample size (N=2). This severely limits the generalizability of any findings. Standard statistical tests of significance are not meaningful with a sample this small. Therefore, this analysis should be considered **illustrative of the methodology** to be used on a larger dataset, rather than a conclusive study of the framework's behavior.\n\nFirst, we will set up the environment and load the data.\n\n```python\n# --- 1. SETUP AND DATA LOADING ---\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Set plot style for better aesthetics\nsns.set_theme(style=\"whitegrid\", context=\"talk\")\n\n# The provided score data\nscore_data = [\n  {\n    \"document_index\": 0,\n    \"analysis_id\": \"analysis_v2_analysis_20250921_173659_0\",\n    \"scores\": {\n      \"positive_sentiment\": 1.0,\n      \"negative_sentiment\": 0.0\n    },\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-21T21:37:14.294576+00:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"document_index\": 1,\n    \"analysis_id\": \"analysis_v2_analysis_20250921_173659_1\",\n    \"scores\": {\n      \"positive_sentiment\": 0.0,\n      \"negative_sentiment\": 1.0\n    },\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-21T21:37:48.012481+00:00\"\n  }\n]\n\n# Flatten the nested JSON 'scores' into a pandas DataFrame\n# This is a robust way to handle the nested structure\ndf = pd.json_normalize(score_data, sep='_')\n\n# Rename columns for clarity\ndf.rename(columns={'scores_positive_sentiment': 'positive_sentiment', \n                   'scores_negative_sentiment': 'negative_sentiment'}, inplace=True)\n\n# Select only the relevant score columns for analysis\nscores_df = df[['positive_sentiment', 'negative_sentiment']]\n\nprint(\"--- Initial Data ---\")\nprint(scores_df)\n\n```\n\n### **2. Descriptive Statistics**\n\nWe will begin by calculating the basic descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.) for each dimension. This gives us a foundational understanding of the score distribution.\n\n```python\n# --- 2. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS ---\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Descriptive Statistics for Each Dimension ---\")\n# The .describe() method provides a comprehensive summary\ndescriptive_stats = scores_df.describe()\nprint(descriptive_stats)\n```\n\n#### **Execution and Results**\n\n```text\n--- Initial Data ---\n   positive_sentiment  negative_sentiment\n0                 1.0                 0.0\n1                 0.0                 1.0\n\n--- Descriptive Statistics for Each Dimension ---\n       positive_sentiment  negative_sentiment\ncount            2.000000            2.000000\nmean             0.500000            0.500000\nstd              0.707107            0.707107\nmin              0.000000            0.000000\n25%              0.250000            0.250000\n50%              0.500000            0.500000\n75%              0.750000            0.750000\nmax              1.000000            1.000000\n```\n\n#### **Interpretation of Descriptive Statistics**\n\n*   **Count:** As noted, we have only 2 data points.\n*   **Mean:** The mean score for both `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` is 0.5. This is simply the average of the two extreme scores (0.0 and 1.0) present in the data.\n*   **Standard Deviation (std):** The standard deviation of ~0.707 indicates the scores are spread far from the mean. This is expected, as the only scores are the minimum and maximum possible values.\n*   **Min/Max:** The scores for both dimensions span the entire possible range from 0.0 to 1.0.\n\nThese statistics confirm that the sample data consists of two diametrically opposed cases: one fully positive and one fully negative.\n\n### **3. Correlation Analysis**\n\nNext, we analyze the relationship between the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` dimensions. The framework context suggests these dimensions should be inversely related (i.e., when one is high, the other should be low). We will investigate this with a scatter plot and a Pearson correlation coefficient.\n\n```python\n# --- 3. CORRELATION ANALYSIS ---\n\n# 3a. Visualization with a Scatter Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nscatter_plot = sns.scatterplot(\n    data=scores_df, \n    x='positive_sentiment', \n    y='negative_sentiment',\n    s=200 # increase marker size for visibility\n)\nscatter_plot.set_title('Relationship between Positive and Negative Sentiment')\nscatter_plot.set_xlabel('Positive Sentiment Score')\nscatter_plot.set_ylabel('Negative Sentiment Score')\nplt.xlim(-0.1, 1.1)\nplt.ylim(-0.1, 1.1)\nplt.show()\n\n# 3b. Pearson Correlation Coefficient\n# The .corr() method on the DataFrame creates a correlation matrix\ncorrelation_matrix = scores_df.corr(method='pearson')\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Correlation Matrix ---\")\nprint(correlation_matrix)\n\n# For a more detailed output including the p-value, we use scipy.stats\n# Note: The p-value is meaningless with N=2, but we show the calculation for methodology.\npearson_corr, p_value = stats.pearsonr(scores_df['positive_sentiment'], scores_df['negative_sentiment'])\n\nprint(f\"\\nPearson Correlation Coefficient: {pearson_corr:.4f}\")\n\n```\n\n#### **Execution and Results**\n\n**(Scatter Plot Visualization)**\n\n\n```text\n--- Correlation Matrix ---\n                    positive_sentiment  negative_sentiment\npositive_sentiment                 1.0                -1.0\nnegative_sentiment                -1.0                 1.0\n\nPearson Correlation Coefficient: -1.0000\n```\n\n#### **Interpretation of Correlation Analysis**\n\n*   **Scatter Plot:** The plot visually confirms a perfect, linear, and negative relationship. As `positive_sentiment` increases, `negative_sentiment` decreases.\n*   **Correlation Coefficient:** The Pearson correlation coefficient is **-1.0**. This indicates a **perfect negative correlation**. For every unit increase in one variable, there is a corresponding unit decrease in the other.\n*   **Contextual Meaning:** This result aligns perfectly with the theoretical foundation of the \"Sentiment Binary Framework.\" The framework is designed to measure opposing sentiments. The two sample data points, representing a \"perfectly positive\" and a \"perfectly negative\" case, demonstrate this intended opposition flawlessly.\n\n### **4. Statistical Significance Testing**\n\nWe attempt to calculate a p-value to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant. However, as stated previously, this is not a valid test with only two data points.\n\n#### **Explanation of Limitations**\n\nThe p-value for a correlation tests the null hypothesis that the true correlation in the population is zero. To do this, the test requires degrees of freedom, which are calculated as `N - 2`.\n\n*   In our case, `N=2`.\n*   Degrees of Freedom = 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nWith zero degrees of freedom, a p-value cannot be meaningfully calculated. Any two distinct points can be connected by a straight line, resulting in a perfect correlation of +1.0 or -1.0. We have no information to suggest this relationship would hold with a third, fourth, or larger set of data points. It is a mathematical artifact of the sample size.\n\n**Conclusion on Significance:** It is **not possible** to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant.\n\n### **5. Summary of Key Findings**\n\nThis analysis, while limited by its sample size, provides a clear picture of the supplied data and demonstrates the analytical methodology.\n\n1.  **Opposing Score Profile:** The dataset contains two records with perfectly inverse sentiment profiles: (Positive=1.0, Negative=0.0) and (Positive=0.0, Negative=1.0).\n\n2.  **Perfect Negative Correlation:** The `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` dimensions exhibit a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.0) within this dataset. This is mathematically guaranteed with these two specific data points.\n\n3.  **Framework Validation:** The results are consistent with the design of the \"Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0,\" which is intended to measure opposing sentiments. The data suggests the framework is performing as expected for clear, extreme test cases.\n\n4.  **Critical Methodological Caveat:** **The sample size (N=2) is insufficient for any inferential statistics.** The findings cannot be generalized. The perfect correlation is an artifact of the small sample size and does not provide evidence of this relationship in a larger population of documents.\n\n### **Recommendations for Future Analysis**\n\nTo conduct a meaningful and robust statistical analysis of this framework, a significantly larger dataset is required. A sample size of **at least 30-50 documents** with varied sentiment would be a reasonable starting point to:\n*   Produce more reliable descriptive statistics.\n*   Assess the correlation with a degree of confidence.\n*   Perform valid statistical significance testing to understand if the dimensions are truly independent or mutually exclusive across a wider range of texts.",
