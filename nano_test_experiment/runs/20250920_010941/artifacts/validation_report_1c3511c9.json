The Framework v10.0 specification recommends an enhanced object structure (e.g., `{'phrase': 'example', 'explanation': 'why it is an example'}`) to provide more context to the analysis agent, which can improve accuracy.",
      "impact": "The current format is valid, but providing more context can lead to more reliable and accurate scoring by the analysis agent, especially for complex dimensions.",
      "fix": "For each dimension's `markers`, convert the lists of strings under `positive_examples` and `negative_examples` into lists of objects, each with a `phrase` and an `explanation` key.",
