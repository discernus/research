A higher positive value indicates predominantly positive sentiment, a negative value indicates predominantly negative sentiment, and a value close to zero suggests a more neutral or balanced sentiment.\n\n2.  **Sentiment Dominance**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment['raw_score'] - negative_sentiment['raw_score']`\n    *   **Purpose**: This is identical to the \"Overall Sentiment Score\" in this specific framework because the dimensions are binary and do not overlap in a way that would require a different calculation for dominance. It clearly shows which sentiment is \"winning\" in the text.\n\n3.  **Sentiment Balance Ratio**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment['raw_score'] / (negative_sentiment['raw_score'] + epsilon)` (where epsilon is a small number to prevent division by zero)\n    *   **Purpose**: This metric quantifies the ratio of positive to negative sentiment. A value significantly greater than 1 indicates strong positive sentiment relative to negative. A value close to 1 suggests a balance. A value less than 1 (but greater than 0) indicates a stronger negative sentiment. It helps understand the *relative* strength of positive versus negative expressions.\n\n4.  **Sentiment Strength Score**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment['raw_score'] + negative_sentiment['raw_score']`\n    *   **Purpose**: This metric sums the scores of both positive and negative sentiment. It indicates the overall \"intensity\" of sentiment expressed in the text, regardless of direction. A higher score means more emotional language is present, whether it's positive, negative, or a mix.\n\n5.  **Neutrality Score**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `1.0 - abs(overall_sentiment)`\n    *   **Purpose**: This metric measures how close the sentiment is to being neutral. A score of 1.0 means the sentiment is perfectly neutral (e.g., the overall\\_sentiment score is 0). A score of 0.0 means the sentiment is maximally biased towards either positive or negative. This is useful for identifying texts that are not strongly opinionated in either direction.\n\n**Results of Execution:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"document_id\": \"document_0\",\n    \"positive_sentiment\": {\n      \"raw_score\": 0.95,\n      \"salience\": 0.95,\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    \"negative_sentiment\": {\n      \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n      \"salience\": 0.0,\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    \"overall_sentiment\": 0.95,\n    \"sentiment_dominance\": 0.95,\n    \"sentiment_balance_ratio\": 1.0,\n    \"sentiment_strength\": 0.95,\n    \"neutrality_score\": 0.05\n  },\n  {\n    \"document_id\": \"document_1\",\n    \"positive_sentiment\": {\n      \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n      \"salience\": 0.0,\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    \"negative_sentiment\": {\n      \"raw_score\": 0.95,\n      \"salience\": 0.95,\n      \"confidence\": 1.0\n    },\n    \"overall_sentiment\": -0.95,\n    \"sentiment_dominance\": -0.95,\n    \"sentiment_balance_ratio\": 0.0,\n    \"sentiment_strength\": 0.95,\n    \"neutrality_score\": 0.05\n  }\n]\n```",
