      "description": "The 'markers' section in the framework uses simple string lists for examples. The v10.0 framework specification recommends an enhanced object structure providing both a 'phrase' and an 'explanation' to improve analytical accuracy.",
      "impact": "While functional, simple string lists provide less context to the analysis agent, which may lead to less precise interpretation of the dimensions, especially in more complex frameworks. Providing an explanation for why a marker is relevant improves agent performance.",
      "fix": "In 'sentiment_binary_v1.md', convert the 'markers' for each dimension from a simple list of strings to a list of objects. For example, change `positive_examples: [\"great\"]` to `positive_examples: [{\"phrase\": \"great\", \"explanation\": \"A clear and direct indicator of positive sentiment.\"}]`. This aligns with the 'Advanced Markers Structure' best practice in the v10.0 specification.",
