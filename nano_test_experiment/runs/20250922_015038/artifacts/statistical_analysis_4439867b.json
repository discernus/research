As a statistical analysis expert, I will now generate and execute Python code to analyze the provided data according to your request.\n\n### **Statistical Analysis Report: Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0**\n\n---\n\n### **1. Introduction & Setup**\n\nThis report provides a statistical analysis of the results from the `sentiment_binary_v1` framework. The goal is to understand the distribution of scores and the relationships between the analytical dimensions.\n\nThe analysis is conducted using Python with the standard scientific stack: `pandas` for data manipulation, `scipy` for statistical calculations, and `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for visualizations.\n\n#### **Python Code: Initial Setup**\n\nFirst, we'll import the necessary libraries and load the provided analysis data into a pandas DataFrame.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport json\n\n# Set plot style for better aesthetics\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 6)\n\n# Provided analysis data\nanalysis_data = [\n  {\n    \"document_index\": 0,\n    \"analysis_id\": \"analysis_v2_analysis_20250921_215056_0\",\n    \"scores\": {\n      \"positive_sentiment\": 1.0,\n      \"negative_sentiment\": 0.0\n    },\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-22T01:51:14.348800+00:00\",\n    \"data_type\": \"scores\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"document_index\": 1,\n    \"analysis_id\": \"analysis_v2_analysis_20250921_215056_1\",\n    \"scores\": {\n      \"positive_sentiment\": 0.05,\n      \"negative_sentiment\": 1.0\n    },\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-22T01:51:40.523223+00:00\",\n    \"data_type\": \"scores\"\n  }\n]\n\n# --- Data Preparation ---\n# Filter for score data and flatten the nested structure\nscore_data = [d for d in analysis_data if d.get(\"data_type\") == \"scores\"]\nif score_data:\n    # Use json_normalize to elegantly flatten the nested 'scores' dictionary\n    df_scores = pd.json_normalize(score_data, sep='_')\n    print(\"Prepared Score Data:\")\n    print(df_scores[['document_index', 'scores_positive_sentiment', 'scores_negative_sentiment']].to_string())\nelse:\n    df_scores = pd.DataFrame()\n    print(\"No score data found.\")\n\n# Note: The dataset contains no 'derived_metrics', so that part of the analysis is skipped.\n```\n\n### **2. Descriptive Statistics**\n\nWe will begin by calculating descriptive statistics for each dimension (`positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`) to understand their central tendency, dispersion, and range.\n\n#### **Python Code: Descriptive Statistics**\n\n```python\nif not df_scores.empty:\n    # Select only the score columns for statistical analysis\n    score_columns = [col for col in df_scores.columns if col.startswith('scores_')]\n    \n    # Calculate and display descriptive statistics\n    descriptive_stats = df_scores[score_columns].describe()\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Descriptive Statistics for Dimensional Scores ---\")\n    print(descriptive_stats.rename(columns={\n        'scores_positive_sentiment': 'positive_sentiment',\n        'scores_negative_sentiment': 'negative_sentiment'\n    }).to_string())\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nCannot calculate descriptive statistics: No score data available.\")\n\n```\n\n#### **Results: Descriptive Statistics**\n\n```text\n--- Descriptive Statistics for Dimensional Scores ---\n       positive_sentiment  negative_sentiment\ncount            2.000000            2.000000\nmean             0.525000            0.500000\nstd              0.671751            0.707107\nmin              0.050000            0.000000\n25%              0.287500            0.250000\n50%              0.525000            0.500000\n75%              0.762500            0.750000\nmax              1.000000            1.000000\n```\n\n#### **Interpretation**\n\n*   **Sample Size:** The analysis is based on a very small sample of **N=2**. This is a critical limitation, and all findings should be considered descriptive and exploratory, not generalizable.\n*   **Central Tendency:** The mean scores for both `positive_sentiment` (0.525) and `negative_sentiment` (0.500) are near the center of the 0-1 scale.\n*   **Dispersion:** The standard deviations are very high (`positive_sentiment`: 0.67, `negative_sentiment`: 0.71), indicating that the scores are widely spread out and not clustered around the mean. This is expected given one document scored high on positive and the other high on negative.\n*   **Range:** Both dimensions utilize the full range of the scale, with scores observed at or near the minimum (0.0/0.05) and maximum (1.0).\n\n### **3. Correlation and Relationship Analysis**\n\nNext, we will examine the relationship between the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` dimensions. We expect these to be inversely correlated, as the framework is designed to measure opposing sentiments.\n\n#### **Python Code: Correlation and Visualization**\n\n```python\nif not df_scores.empty and len(df_scores) > 1:\n    # --- Correlation Calculation ---\n    positive_col = 'scores_positive_sentiment'\n    negative_col = 'scores_negative_sentiment'\n    \n    # Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value\n    correlation, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df_scores[positive_col], df_scores[negative_col])\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Correlation Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r): {correlation:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"P-value: {p_value:.4f}\")\n\n    # --- Visualization ---\n    \n    # Scatter Plot to visualize the relationship\n    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\n    scatter_plot = sns.scatterplot(\n        data=df_scores,\n        x=positive_col,\n        y=negative_col\n    )\n    scatter_plot.set_title('Relationship between Positive and Negative Sentiment', fontsize=16)\n    scatter_plot.set_xlabel('Positive Sentiment Score', fontsize=12)\n    scatter_plot.set_ylabel('Negative Sentiment Score', fontsize=12)\n    scatter_plot.set_xlim(-0.05, 1.05)\n    scatter_plot.set_ylim(-0.05, 1.05)\n    print(\"\\nGenerating Scatter Plot...\")\n    plt.show()\n\n    # Correlation Matrix and Heatmap\n    correlation_matrix = df_scores[[positive_col, negative_col]].corr()\n    correlation_matrix.columns = ['Positive', 'Negative']\n    correlation_matrix.index = ['Positive', 'Negative']\n\n    plt.figure(figsize=(7, 5))\n    heatmap = sns.heatmap(\n        correlation_matrix, \n        annot=True, \n        cmap='coolwarm', \n        vmin=-1, \n        vmax=1\n    )\n    heatmap.set_title('Correlation Matrix of Sentiment Scores', fontsize=16)\n    print(\"\\nGenerating Correlation Heatmap...\")\n    plt.show()\n\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nCannot perform correlation analysis: Requires at least 2 data points.\")\n\n```\n\n#### **Results: Correlation and Visualization**\n\n```text\n--- Correlation Analysis ---\nPearson Correlation Coefficient (r): -1.0000\nP-value: 1.0000\n\nGenerating Scatter Plot...\n```\n\n\n```text\nGenerating Correlation Heatmap...\n```\n\n\n#### **Interpretation**\n\n*   **Correlation Coefficient (r):** The Pearson correlation coefficient is **-1.0000**. This indicates a **perfect negative linear correlation**. As the score for `positive_sentiment` increases, the score for `negative_sentiment` decreases proportionally. This is clearly visible in the scatter plot, where the two data points form a perfectly straight line with a negative slope. This suggests the analysis framework is successfully identifying and scoring the two sentiments as opposites.\n*   **Statistical Significance (P-value):** The calculated p-value is **1.0000**. This result may seem counterintuitive but is statistically correct and critically important.\n    *   **The Problem of N=2:** A correlation test's degrees of freedom are N-2. With a sample size of N=2, the degrees of freedom is 0. With zero degrees of freedom, any two points will always form a perfect line, so observing a perfect correlation is guaranteed.\n    *   **Conclusion on Significance:** The high p-value correctly indicates that we **cannot reject the null hypothesis** (that there is no correlation). The perfect correlation observed is an artifact of the tiny sample size and has no statistical significance. We cannot generalize this finding to a larger population of documents.\n\n### **4. Summary of Key Findings**\n\nThis analysis provides a snapshot of the `sentiment_binary_v1` framework's performance on a test set of two documents.\n\n*   **Oppositional Scoring:** The framework appears to function as intended by assigning opposing scores to the two documents. When one document received a high `positive_sentiment` score (1.0), its `negative_sentiment` score was zero, and vice-versa.\n*   **Perfect Negative Correlation (Descriptive):** Descriptively, the two dimensions are perfectly negatively correlated (r = -1.0). This aligns with the theoretical foundation of the framework, where positive and negative sentiments are considered mutually exclusive.\n*   **Critical Limitation - Sample Size:** **The most important finding is the limitation of the data itself.** With a sample size of only two, no statistically significant conclusions can be drawn. The results are purely descriptive of this specific pair of documents and cannot be used to make reliable inferences about the framework's general behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis confirms that for this minimal test case, the scoring pipeline produces outputs that are consistent with the `Sentiment Binary Framework`'s design. However, a much larger and more diverse dataset is required for any meaningful statistical validation.",
