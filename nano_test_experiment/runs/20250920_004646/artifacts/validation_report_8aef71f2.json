      "description": "The corpus manifest specifies `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, which is outdated. The current standard provided in the reference documentation is v8.0.2. While the experiment is simple and not negatively affected, using the latest specification version ensures consistency and access to the latest features and validation rules.",
      "impact": "The current setup is functional due to backward compatibility. However, for future experiments, especially those requiring advanced features like custom analytical groupings for statistics, using an outdated spec version could lead to validation failures or unexpected behavior.",
      "fix": "In `corpus.md`, update the `spec_version` field from `\"8.0\"` to `\"8.0.2\"` to align with the current corpus specification standard.",
