This structure is easily parsable and can be used for tasks like:\n\n*   **Aggregation:** Calculating average scores across documents.\n*   **Filtering:** Selecting documents based on score thresholds.\n*   **Visualization:** Plotting scores for comparison.\n*   **Further Analysis:** Using these scores as features in another machine learning model.",
