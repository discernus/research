      "description": "The 'markers' within the framework dimensions use simple string lists. The v10.0 framework specification recommends an enhanced object structure for markers (e.g., {phrase: '...', explanation: '...'}) to provide more context to the analysis agent and improve accuracy.",
      "impact": "Using simple string lists is functional but may lead to less precise analysis compared to the richer object format, which provides explicit explanations for why a phrase is a positive or negative example.",
      "fix": "Update the 'markers' in 'sentiment_binary_v1.md' to use an array of objects, each with 'phrase' and 'explanation' keys, for both 'positive_examples' and 'negative_examples'.",

      "description": "The 'analysis_prompt' in the framework is functional but minimal. The v10.0 framework specification provides detailed templates for prompts that include sections like 'IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS', 'EVIDENCE STANDARDS', and 'ANALYTICAL APPROACH' to better guide the analysis agent.",
      "impact": "A more detailed prompt reduces ambiguity and improves the consistency and reliability of the analysis, especially if the framework were to be expanded or used in more complex scenarios.",
      "fix": "Enhance the 'analysis_prompt' in 'sentiment_binary_v1.md' to incorporate the recommended detailed sections from the v10.0 framework specification to provide more robust guidance to the agent.",

      "description": "The corpus manifest YAML does not contain a top-level 'description' field. While not a required field, it is recommended in the v8.0 Corpus Specification for providing a brief, machine-readable summary of the corpus.",
      "impact": "The absence of this field slightly reduces the at-a-glance context available within the YAML block, though the information is present in the human-readable part of the file.",
      "fix": "Add a 'description' key to the top level of the YAML block in 'corpus.md' with a concise summary of the corpus.",
