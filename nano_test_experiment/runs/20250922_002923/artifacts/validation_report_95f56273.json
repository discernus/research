      "impact": "The results of this experiment will be limited to a qualitative comparison of the two documents. No inferential statistical analysis (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) can be performed, and no generalizable conclusions can be drawn.",
      "fix": "For the stated research questions, which focus on basic pipeline validation and observing a clear distinction, this sample size is adequate. If the intent were to perform statistical analysis, the corpus would need to be expanded significantly.",

    "The 'analysis_prompt' in 'sentiment_binary_v1.md' is functional for this simple test case. For more complex frameworks, consider enriching the prompt by defining an expert persona and providing more theoretical context to improve agent performance, as recommended in the v10.0 framework specification."
