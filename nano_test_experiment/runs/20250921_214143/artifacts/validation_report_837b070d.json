      "description": "The corpus size of N=2 is insufficient for inferential statistical analysis. The experiment's research questions can only be answered descriptively.",
      "impact": "No statistical tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) can be performed to determine if differences between documents are statistically significant. Analysis will be limited to qualitative comparison of the dimensional scores for the two documents.",
      "fix": "For the stated goal of minimal pipeline validation, no fix is necessary as this corpus size is adequate. If the intent was statistical comparison, the corpus would need to be expanded to a minimum of N=10 for descriptive statistics and N>20 for limited inferential testing.",
