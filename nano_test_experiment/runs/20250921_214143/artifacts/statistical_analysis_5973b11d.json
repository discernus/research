As a statistical analysis expert, I will generate and execute Python code to analyze the provided dimensional scores.\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nThe analysis was performed on a dataset with a sample size of **N=2**. This is an extremely small sample, which severely limits the validity and generalizability of any statistical findings. Standard inferential statistics (like p-values) are not meaningful in this context. The results below are descriptive of this specific sample only and should not be used to draw conclusions about the framework's general behavior.\n\n**Key Observations (for this N=2 sample only):**\n1.  **Descriptive Statistics:** The scores for `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` are perfectly balanced in this sample, with an equal mean score of 0.475.\n2.  **Score Distribution:** The data consists of two archetypal examples: one document is purely positive (0.95), and the other is purely negative (0.95).\n3.  **Correlation:** A perfect negative correlation of -1.0 exists between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`. This is an artifact of the two data points provided and means that as one score increases, the other decreases in a perfectly linear fashion *within this specific sample*.\n\n**Recommendation:** To perform a meaningful statistical analysis and validate the framework's behavior, a significantly larger dataset (ideally N > 30) is required.\n\n---\n\n### Python Analysis Code\n\nHere is the complete Python code used for the analysis.

Descriptive Statistics\n\n*   **Mean:** The average score for both `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` is 0.475. This indicates that, across this tiny sample, the dimensions are perfectly balanced.\n*   **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation for both dimensions is approximately 0.67. This high value reflects the extreme polarization of the two data points (one is at 0.0, the other at 0.95), indicating a very large spread relative to the mean. This is not a measure of general variance, but simply the distribution of these two specific points.\n\n#### 2. Correlation Analysis\n\n*   A **Pearson correlation coefficient of -1.0** was observed. This signifies a perfect negative linear relationship. For this sample, when the `positive_sentiment` score goes up, the `negative_sentiment` score goes down by an exactly proportional amount.\n*   **Crucial Caveat:** This result is an artifact of having only two data points. Any two distinct points can be connected by a straight line, leading to a correlation of either +1.0 or -1.0 (unless they form a perfectly horizontal or vertical line). This finding **cannot be generalized** to claim that the framework always produces negatively correlated scores. It only shows that for the two test documents provided, one was positive and the other was negative.\n\n#### 3. Statistical Significance\n\n*   The analysis yielded a **p-value of 1.0**. In a normal analysis, a p-value > 0.05 would mean the correlation is not statistically significant. Here, a p-value of 1.0 is the highest possible, reinforcing that the observed correlation of -1.0 is statistically meaningless and likely due to chance given the sample size. It is impossible to reject the null hypothesis (that there is no correlation) with N=2.\n\n### Final Conclusion for Researchers\n\nThe provided data is suitable for a basic \"sanity check\" to ensure the `Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0` pipeline can produce outputs for its defined dimensions. However, the sample size of two documents is critically insufficient for any meaningful statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics and perfect negative correlation are descriptive of this sample only and should not be interpreted as a general characteristic of the framework.\n\nTo properly evaluate the framework's properties, such as the true relationship between positive and negative sentiment scores and their typical distribution, it is essential to run it on a much larger and more diverse corpus of documents.",
