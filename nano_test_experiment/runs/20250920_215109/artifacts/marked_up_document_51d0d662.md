  "marked_up_document": "<negative_sentiment>The proposed industrial zoning changes represent a catastrophic betrayal of public trust and an assault on our community's well-being. The plan, drafted with no meaningful public consultation, threatens to decimate protected wetlands and irrevocably poison our local water supply with industrial runoff. Residents are rightfully outraged, fearing the long-term health consequences and the destruction of the natural landscapes that define our town's character. This is not progress; it is a reckless, shortsighted capitulation to corporate interests over human lives.\n\nThe complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude from officials have only fueled the growing sense of despair and anger. Community meetings have been little more than performative gestures, with legitimate concerns brushed aside and expert warnings ignored. The entire process has been a masterclass in bureaucratic arrogance, leaving citizens feeling powerless and unheard. This policy is a festering wound that will undoubtedly lead to years of environmental degradation and legal battles, leaving a permanent scar on our town.</negative_sentiment>",
