Framework Review:**\n\n*   The `FRAMEWORK` explicitly states `derived_metrics: []`, indicating that **no derived metrics are defined within this specific framework version (v1.0)**.\n*   The framework's primary purpose is described as a \"minimalist framework for measuring basic positive vs negative sentiment to validate pipeline functionality,\" further emphasizing its simplicity and lack of complex derived metrics.\n\n**2. Derived Metrics Code Review:**\n\n*   The Python code block correctly identifies that the `derived_metrics` list in the framework is empty.\n*   It then proceeds to *demonstrate* how one *could* calculate hypothetical derived metrics (`sentiment_intensity` and `net_sentiment`) if they were defined. This is explicitly stated in the comments: \"For this framework, no derived metrics are explicitly defined. However, if we wanted to, for example, create a \"sentiment_intensity\" metric, we could do so.\" and \"This is a hypothetical derived metric not present in the provided framework...\".\n\n**3. Calculation Verification for `document_1`:**\n\nGiven `document_scores` for `document_1`:\n*   `positive_sentiment` (raw_score) = `0.0`\n*   `negative_sentiment` (raw_score) = `1.0`\n\n**Hypothetical Derived Metric 1: `sentiment_intensity`**\n*   Formula: `abs(positive_score - negative_score)`\n*   Calculation: `abs(0.0 - 1.0) = abs(-1.0) = 1.0`\n*   **Result in JSON:** `1.0`\n*   **Verification:** **Correct.**\n\n**Hypothetical Derived Metric 2: `net_sentiment`**\n*   Formula: `positive_score - negative_score`\n*   Calculation: `0.0 - 1.0 = -1.0`\n*   **Result in JSON:** `-1.0`\n*   **Verification:** **Correct.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the provided framework **does not define any derived metrics**, the Python code accurately *demonstrates* how to calculate two *hypothetical* derived metrics (`sentiment_intensity` and `net_sentiment`) based on the dimensional scores.\n\nThe calculations for `sentiment_intensity` (1.0) and `net_sentiment` (-1.0) for `document_1` are **mathematically correct** according to the formulas implemented in the Python script and match the provided JSON output.", "document_index": 1, "document_name": "document_1", "timestamp": "2025-09-20T14:24:09.571329+00:00", "artifact_hash": "f8bb0ddd4f0f21d4160fe1535105693c576f5f6a3f1fd7452aa3d7e737cdeadf"}
