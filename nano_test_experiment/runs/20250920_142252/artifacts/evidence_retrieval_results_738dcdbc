Residents are rightfully outraged, fearing the long-term health consequences and the destruction of the natural landscapes that define our town's character. This is not progress; it is a reckless, shortsighted capitulation to corporate interests over human lives.\n\nThe complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude from officials have only fueled the growing sense of despair and anger. Community meetings have been little more than performative gestures, with legitimate concerns brushed aside and expert warnings ignored.
