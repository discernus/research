      "description": "The scoring bands defined in the framework's `analysis_prompt` do not match the `scoring_calibration` for the dimensions. The prompt defines the highest tier of sentiment as '0.9-1.0', while the `scoring_calibration` section defines the 'high' tier as '0.7-1.0'.",
      "impact": "The analysis agent will receive conflicting instructions for scoring, which can lead to inconsistent and unpredictable results. The agent might anchor to one definition over the other, reducing the reliability of the output.",
      "fix": "Unify the scoring bands across the `analysis_prompt` and `scoring_calibration` sections for both `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` dimensions. It is recommended to update the `analysis_prompt` to match the more detailed `scoring_calibration` ranges (e.g., 'high: 0.7-1.0').",

      "description": "The `analysis_prompt` in the framework refers to dimensions using capitalized, space-separated names ('POSITIVE SENTIMENT', 'NEGATIVE SENTIMENT') instead of the official snake_case names (`positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`) defined in the `dimensions` and `output_schema` sections.",
      "impact": "This violates the v10.0 specification best practice: 'Use exact dimension names as specified - do not substitute similar concepts.' While a robust agent might infer the mapping, this ambiguity introduces a risk of misinterpretation or scoring errors, especially if the framework were more complex.",
      "fix": "Update the `analysis_prompt` to use the exact, official dimension names (`positive_sentiment`, `negative_sentiment`) when providing instructions to ensure unambiguous mapping and reliable scoring.",
