The specification mandates this section must include a discussion of core theories and citations to academic literature to establish scholarly grounding, which are currently absent.",
      "impact": "The experiment will be rejected as the framework fails to meet the minimum structural and content requirements of the v10.0 specification. The platform cannot execute experiments with non-compliant core components.",
      "fix": "Add a '## Theoretical & Empirical Foundations' section to 'sentiment_binary_v1.md'. This section should briefly discuss the scholarly basis for binary sentiment analysis and include at least one citation to a relevant source to meet the specification's requirement.",

      "description": "The 'analysis_prompt' in the 'default' variant of the framework is overly simplistic and does not follow the v10.0 specification's best practices for agent interaction. It provides direct instructions rather than establishing an expert persona and providing contextual guidance, which can reduce analytical reliability.",
      "impact": "While not blocking execution, this may lead to less consistent analytical results. The analysis agent may not perform optimally without the proper contextual framing, potentially affecting the quality of the output scores and evidence.",
      "fix": "Revise the 'analysis_prompt' to align with the recommended v10.0 template. For example, begin with 'You are an expert analyst specializing in basic sentiment analysis...' and structure the prompt to provide context rather than just a list of rules.",
