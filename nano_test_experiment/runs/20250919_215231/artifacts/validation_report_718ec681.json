      "impact": "While this does not block execution for a test framework, it fails to meet the scholarly artifact standards of the v10.0 specification, reducing the framework's credibility and reusability.",

      "description": "The 'analysis_prompt' in the framework's 'default' variant is overly simplistic and does not align with the best-practice template provided in the v10.0 Framework specification. It lacks an explicit expert persona, a summary of the methodology, and other contextual elements.",
      "impact": "A minimal prompt may lead to less consistent and reliable analysis from the LLM agent, as it has less context to guide its scoring and reasoning process.",
      "fix": "Revise the `analysis_prompt` in 'sentiment_binary_v1.md' to incorporate the detailed structure recommended in the specification, including a defined expert persona (e.g., 'You are an expert in basic sentiment analysis...'), a summary of the methodology, and explicit instructions for the dimensions.",

      "description": "The 'markers' for each dimension use a simple list of strings. The v10.0 framework specification recommends an 'Advanced Markers Structure' using objects with 'phrase' and 'explanation' keys for better LLM performance.",
      "impact": "The LLM may have difficulty understanding the nuances of why a specific phrase is a positive or negative example without explicit explanations, which can slightly reduce scoring accuracy.",
      "fix": "Consider converting the 'markers' in 'sentiment_binary_v1.md' from simple string lists to a list of objects, each with a `phrase` and an `explanation` key, as demonstrated in the 'Advanced Markers Structure' section of the v10.0 framework specification.",
