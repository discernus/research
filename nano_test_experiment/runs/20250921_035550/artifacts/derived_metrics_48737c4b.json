Is the text primarily positive, negative, or neutral/mixed?\n    *   **Calculation**: It compares the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` scores. A simple thresholding mechanism is used to classify the overall sentiment. If the difference between positive and negative scores is significant (e.g., > 0.3), it's classified as the dominant sentiment. Otherwise, it's considered neutral or mixed.\n    *   **Interpretation**: A \"Positive\" label suggests the text leans towards positive language, \"Negative\" towards negative, and \"Neutral/Mixed\" indicates a balance or weak expression of both. The associated `score` is the raw difference for context.\n\n2.  **Sentiment Intensity**:\n    *   **Purpose**: To quantify the overall strength of emotional expression, irrespective of whether it's positive or negative.\n    *   **Calculation**: This is the maximum value between the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` scores.\n    *   **Interpretation**: A higher \"Intensity\" score means the text contains more strongly expressed emotional language, whether that emotion is positive or negative. It tells us *how much* emotion is present.\n\n3.  **Sentiment Imbalance**:\n    *   **Purpose**: To measure how skewed the sentiment is towards one pole (positive or negative).\n    *   **Calculation**: It's calculated as `1 - (min(positive_score, negative_score) / (positive_score + negative_score))`. If `positive_score + negative_score` is zero, imbalance is 0.0. This formula results in a score closer to 1 when one sentiment dominates significantly, and closer to 0 when sentiments are balanced or absent.\n    *   **Interpretation**: A score of 1.0 would mean one sentiment is 1.0 and the other is 0.0 (maximum imbalance). A score of 0.0 would mean both are 0.0 or they are perfectly equal (e.g., 0.5 positive, 0.5 negative).\n\n4.  **Simple Emotionality (Sum)**:\n    *   **Purpose**: A straightforward measure of the total amount of emotional language detected.\n    *   **Calculation**: This is simply the sum of the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` scores.\n    *   **Interpretation**: A higher score indicates a greater overall presence of words and phrases associated with emotions, making the text more \"emotional\" in nature.\n\n---\n\n### Execution Results:\n\n```\n--- Input Dimensional Scores ---\n{\n  \"positive_sentiment\": 0.0,\n  \"negative_sentiment\": 1.0\n}\n\n--- Calculated Derived Metrics ---\n{\n  \"overall_sentiment_polarity\": {\n    \"label\": \"Negative\",\n    \"score\": -1.0,\n    \"explanation\": \"Negative sentiment (1.00) significantly outweighs positive sentiment (0.00).\"\n  },\n  \"sentiment_intensity\": {\n    \"label\": \"Intensity\",\n    \"score\": 1.0,\n    \"explanation\": \"The maximum detected sentiment score (Positive: 0.00, Negative: 1.00), indicating overall emotional strength.\"\n  },\n  \"sentiment_imbalance\": {\n    \"label\": \"Imbalance\",\n    \"score\": 0.0,\n    \"explanation\": \"Measures the dominance of one sentiment over the other.
