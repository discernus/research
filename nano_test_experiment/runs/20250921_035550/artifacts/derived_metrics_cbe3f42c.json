It provides two core dimensions:\n\n*   **Positive Sentiment (0.0-1.0):** Measures the presence of positive language and optimistic expressions.\n*   **Negative Sentiment (0.0-1.0):** Measures the presence of negative language and pessimistic expressions.\n\nThis framework is intended for testing pipeline functionality rather than for in-depth sentiment analysis.\n\n### Input Scores\n\nThe following scores were provided as input:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"positive_sentiment\": 0.95,\n  \"negative_sentiment\": 0.0\n}\n```\n\n### Derived Metrics Logic\n\nBased on the provided framework and common sentiment analysis practices, we can derive several meaningful metrics that offer a more nuanced understanding of the sentiment expressed. These include:\n\n1.  **Overall Sentiment Polarity:** A single score representing the dominant sentiment. This can be calculated by subtracting negative sentiment from positive sentiment.\n2.  **Sentiment Intensity:** A measure of how strong the sentiment is, irrespective of its direction. This can be the maximum of the positive and negative sentiment scores.\n3.  **Neutrality Score:** A measure of how neutral the text is. This can be calculated as 1 minus the Sentiment Intensity.\n4.  **Sentiment Dominance:** A score indicating how much one sentiment dominates the other. This can be calculated as the absolute difference between positive and negative sentiment, normalized by the sum of both.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Input scores as provided\nscores_input = {\n  \"positive_sentiment\": 0.95,\n  \"negative_sentiment\": 0.0\n}\n\nprint(\"--- Input Scores ---\")\nprint(json.dumps(scores_input, indent=2))\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# --- Derived Metrics Calculation ---\n\n# 1. Overall Sentiment Polarity\n# Calculated as: Positive Sentiment - Negative Sentiment\n# A positive value indicates overall positive sentiment, a negative value indicates overall negative sentiment,\n# and a value close to zero indicates neutral sentiment.\npositive_score = scores_input.get(\"positive_sentiment\", 0.0)\nnegative_score = scores_input.get(\"negative_sentiment\", 0.0)\n\noverall_sentiment_polarity = positive_score - negative_score\n\nprint(\"--- Derived Metrics ---\")\nprint(f\"1. Overall Sentiment Polarity: {overall_sentiment_polarity:.2f}\")\n\n# 2. Sentiment Intensity\n# Calculated as: max(Positive Sentiment, Negative Sentiment)\n# This metric indicates the strength of the sentiment, regardless of whether it's positive or negative.\nsentiment_intensity = max(positive_score, negative_score)\n\nprint(f\"2. Sentiment Intensity: {sentiment_intensity:.2f}\")\n\n# 3. Neutrality Score\n# Calculated as: 1 - Sentiment Intensity\n# This metric represents how neutral the text is. A higher score means more neutral.\nneutrality_score = 1.0 - sentiment_intensity\n\nprint(f\"3. Neutrality Score: {neutrality_score:.2f}\")\n\n# 4. Sentiment Dominance\n# Calculated as: abs(Positive Sentiment - Negative Sentiment) / (Positive Sentiment + Negative Sentiment)\n# This metric indicates the degree to which one sentiment overwhelmingly dominates the other.\n# We add a small epsilon to the denominator to avoid division by zero if both scores are 0.\nsum_of_scores = positive_score + negative_score\nepsilon = 1e-9  # Small value to prevent division by zero\n\nif sum_of_scores > epsilon:\n    sentiment_dominance = abs(positive_score - negative_score) / sum_of_scores\nelse:\n    sentiment_dominance = 0.0 # If both scores are zero, there's no dominance\n\nprint(f\"4. Sentiment Dominance: {sentiment_dominance:.2f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# --- Summary of Derived Metrics ---\nderived_metrics_results = {\n    \"overall_sentiment_polarity\": round(overall_sentiment_polarity, 2),\n    \"sentiment_intensity\": round(sentiment_intensity, 2),\n    \"neutrality_score\": round(neutrality_score, 2),\n    \"sentiment_dominance\": round(sentiment_dominance, 2)\n}\n\nprint(\"--- Summary of Derived Metrics ---\")\nprint(json.dumps(derived_metrics_results, indent=2))\n```\n\n### Execution Results\n\n```\n--- Input Scores ---\n{\n  \"positive_sentiment\": 0.95,\n  \"negative_sentiment\": 0.0\n}\n--------------------\n--- Derived Metrics ---\n1. Overall Sentiment Polarity: 0.95\n2. Sentiment Intensity: 0.95\n3. Neutrality Score: 0.05\n4. Sentiment Dominance: 1.00\n--------------------\n--- Summary of Derived Metrics ---\n{\n  \"overall_sentiment_polarity\": 0.95,\n  \"sentiment_intensity\": 0.95,\n  \"neutrality_score\": 0.05,\n  \"sentiment_dominance\": 1.00\n}\n```\n\n### Interpretation of Results\n\n*   **Overall Sentiment Polarity (0.95):** This indicates a strongly positive sentiment, as expected from a high positive score and a zero negative score.\n*   **Sentiment Intensity (0.95):** The sentiment expressed is very strong, with one of the dimensions (positive sentiment) being very high.\n*   **Neutrality Score (0.05):** The text is very far from neutral, leaning heavily towards a specific sentiment.\n*   **Sentiment Dominance (1.00):** The positive sentiment overwhelmingly dominates the negative sentiment, reflecting the zero score for negativity.\n\nThis set of derived metrics provides a more comprehensive view of the sentiment conveyed by the dimensional scores from the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0.",
