  "marked_up_document": "The proposed industrial zoning changes represent a [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: catastrophic betrayal of public trust] and an [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: assault on our community's well-being]. The plan, drafted with [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: no meaningful public consultation], [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: threatens to decimate protected wetlands] and [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: irrevocably poison our local water supply] with industrial runoff. Residents are [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: rightfully outraged], [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: fearing the long-term health consequences] and the [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: destruction of the natural landscapes] that define our town's character. This is [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: not progress]; it is a [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: reckless, shortsighted capitulation to corporate interests over human lives].\n\nThe [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: complete lack of transparency] and the [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: dismissive attitude] from officials have only [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: fueled the growing sense of despair and anger]. Community meetings have been [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: little more than performative gestures], with [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: legitimate concerns brushed aside and expert warnings ignored]. The entire process has been a [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: masterclass in bureaucratic arrogance], leaving citizens [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: feeling powerless and unheard]. This policy is a [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: festering wound] that will undoubtedly lead to [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: years of environmental degradation and legal battles], [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: leaving a permanent scar on our town].\n\nThe environmental impact assessment was [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: deliberately rushed and incomplete], with [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: critical data omitted and independent studies suppressed]. The developers' promises of job creation [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: ring hollow] when weighed against the [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: irreversible damage to our ecosystem]. Local businesses that depend on tourism and outdoor recreation will be [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: devastated], while the promised economic benefits [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: remain speculative at best]. The community's [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: deep-seated anger is justified and growing stronger] with each passing day.\n\nThe mayor's [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: dismissive comments about \"NIMBYism\"] [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: reveal a fundamental contempt for democratic participation and environmental stewardship]. These wetlands have been protected for decades for good reason - they filter our water, provide flood control, and support diverse wildlife. The proposed industrial complex will [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: destroy this irreplaceable natural heritage] while [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: enriching a handful of developers and their political allies]. The [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: betrayal is complete and unforgivable].\n\nResidents have organized peaceful protests, circulated petitions, and engaged in every available democratic channel, only to be met with [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: stonewalling and condescension]. The planning commission's [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: rubber-stamp approval process has been a sham from the beginning], with public input treated as a [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: mere formality]. The environmental groups' warnings about [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: water contamination and habitat destruction] have been [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: systematically ignored], while the developers' lobbyists have enjoyed unprecedented access to decision-makers.\n\nThe long-term consequences of this decision will be [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: devastating and irreversible]. Once the wetlands are [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: destroyed] and the industrial complex is built, there will be [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: no going back]. Our children and grandchildren will inherit a [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: degraded environment, contaminated water], and a community that has [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: lost its natural character]. The short-term economic gains for a few will be [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: dwarfed by the long-term costs borne by everyone]. This is not just [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: bad policy] - it is a [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: moral failure] that will [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: haunt our community for generations].\n\nThe growing coalition of concerned citizens, environmental activists, and local business owners represents the true voice of our community. We will [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: not be silenced or dismissed]. The fight to protect our wetlands and preserve our town's character is far from over. We will use every legal means available to challenge this decision and hold accountable those who have [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: betrayed the public trust]. The [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: environmental damage, economic devastation, and social division caused by this reckless policy] will [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: not be forgotten].\n\nThe developers' claims about environmental safeguards are [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: laughable] given their [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: track record of violations and cost-cutting measures]. The promised \"green technology\" is [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: nothing more than window dressing] designed to placate concerned citizens. The real environmental impact will be [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: catastrophic], with [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: toxic runoff contaminating our water supply] and [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: destroying the delicate wetland ecosystem]. The community's [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: anger and determination to fight this decision are completely justified] and will only [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: grow stronger as the true costs become apparent].\n\nThis industrial zoning change represents [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: everything that is wrong with our current political system] - [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: corporate influence over public interest, environmental destruction for short-term profit], and the [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: systematic disenfranchisement of ordinary citizens]. The developers' promises of economic prosperity are [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: empty], while the environmental and social costs are [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: real and permanent]. We must stand together to protect our community, our environment, and our democratic values from this [NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT: assault on everything we hold dear].",
