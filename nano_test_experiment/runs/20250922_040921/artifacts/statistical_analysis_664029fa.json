For both dimensions, one document scored 0.0 and one document scored 1.0.\n\n\n\n---\n\n### **3. Interpretation of Findings & Summary**\n\nThis section interprets the statistical results in the context of the `Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0`.\n\n#### **1. Descriptive Statistics Interpretation**\nThe descriptive statistics show that for both `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`, the scores exist only at the extremes (min=0.0, max=1.0). The mean of 0.5 for both dimensions is a mathematical artifact of having one score at 0.0 and one at 1.0; it does not indicate that \"average\" scores were observed. The standard deviation of ~0.707 confirms maximum variance for a two-point binary dataset. This suggests the analysis is producing clear, polarized outputs, which aligns with the framework's goal as a simple test utility.\n\n#### **2. Correlation Analysis Interpretation**\nA **perfect negative correlation (r = -1.0)** was observed between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`. This is the strongest possible inverse relationship and is the primary finding of this analysis.\n*   **Meaning:** As the `positive_sentiment` score increases, the `negative_sentiment` score decreases by an equivalent amount.\n*   **Context:** This result is expected and highly desirable for the `Sentiment Binary Framework`. It demonstrates that the model is functioning correctly according to its design, which assumes that positive and negative sentiments are mutually exclusive opposites. A document identified as highly positive is correctly identified as not negative, and vice-versa.\n\n#### **3. Statistical Significance Interpretation**\n*   **Primary Caveat:** The analysis was performed on an extremely small sample size (**n=2**).\n*   **Conclusion on Significance:** Due to the insufficient sample size, it is **not possible to establish statistical significance** for the observed correlation. The calculated p-value of 1.0 is a computational result for n=2 and is meaningless in a hypothesis-testing context. We cannot generalize this perfect correlation to a larger population of documents based on this data.\n\n### **4. Key Findings Summary**\n\n1.  **Perfect Inverse Relationship:** The analysis of the two documents reveals a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.0) between positive and negative sentiment scores. This indicates the analytical model is behaving as designed, producing opposing scores for opposite sentiments.\n\n2.  **Polarized Scoring:** The model produced scores only at the extremes of the scale (0.0 and 1.0), which is consistent with the framework's intended application for \"short text documents with clear emotional content\" and its purpose as a simple pipeline validation tool.\n\n3.  **Critical Limitation - Sample Size:** The most significant limitation of this analysis is the sample size of two documents. While the results on this sample are clear, they lack statistical power and **cannot be generalized**. Any conclusions about the framework's performance on a broader dataset would be speculative.\n\n**Recommendation:** To conduct a robust validation of this framework, a significantly larger and more diverse dataset is required. A larger sample would allow for meaningful significance testing and a more reliable assessment of the framework's behavior across a range of texts.",
