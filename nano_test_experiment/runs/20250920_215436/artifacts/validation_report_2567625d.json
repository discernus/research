      "description": "The Corpus manifest `corpus.md` specifies `spec_version: \"8.0\"`, but the current active standard is `v8.0.2`. Using a deprecated specification version can cause the pipeline to reject the file or lead to misinterpretation of the manifest structure.",
      "impact": "The experiment will fail during the corpus loading phase, as the system's parser is configured for the current v8.0.2 standard and may not be backward-compatible with the v8.0 format.",

      "description": "The `corpus.md` file is missing the `## Document Manifest` markdown header directly above the YAML block. While this does not break machine parsing, it deviates from the standard v8.0.2 format intended for human readability.",
      "impact": "The corpus manifest is less clear for other researchers, violating the 'human-first' documentation principle of the specification.",
      "fix": "Add a `## Document Manifest` header on the line immediately before the ````yaml` block in `corpus.md` to improve compliance and readability.",
