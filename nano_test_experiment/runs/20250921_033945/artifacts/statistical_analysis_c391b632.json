Interpretation and Analysis of Findings**\n\nThis section provides a detailed interpretation of the statistical results for researchers and auditors.\n\n#### **Data Preparation**\n\nThe initial dataset contained inconsistent formatting for the scores. The first record used a nested object with a `raw_score`, while the second used a direct float. The Python script successfully normalized this data by extracting the `raw_score` where present, creating a clean `DataFrame` suitable for analysis. This step is crucial for ensuring data integrity.\n\n#### **Descriptive Statistics**\n\nThe descriptive statistics show that the data points for both dimensions are at the absolute minimum (0.0) and maximum (1.0) of the scale.\n*   **Mean:** The mean for both `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` is 0.5. This is simply the average of 0 and 1.\n*   **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation is ~0.707 for both. This represents the maximum possible variance for a sample of two points on a 0-1 scale, indicating the data is highly polarized.\n*   **Quartiles:** The quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) are mathematical artifacts of the two-point distribution and do not provide much insight beyond reinforcing the wide spread of the data.\n\n**Interpretation:** The descriptive statistics confirm that the two documents represent extreme and opposing examples of sentiment, which aligns with the framework's purpose as a simple validation tool.\n\n#### **Correlation Analysis**\n\nThe analysis revealed a **perfect negative Pearson correlation (r = -1.0)**. This is visualized in the heatmap, where the off-diagonal cell is bright red, indicating a value of -1.0.\n\n**Interpretation:** A correlation of -1.0 means that the two dimensions are perfectly inversely related in this sample. When the `positive_sentiment` score is high (1.0), the `negative_sentiment` score is low (0.0), and vice versa. This is the expected behavior for a binary sentiment framework when tested with one purely positive and one purely negative example. It suggests that, for these two documents, the model correctly identified that high positive sentiment precludes high negative sentiment.\n\n#### **Statistical Significance Testing**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the interpretation.\n*   **Correlation Significance:** The p-value associated with the correlation is 1.0. A p-value is the probability of observing the current result (or a more extreme one) if the null hypothesis (of no correlation) were true. A high p-value (typically > 0.05) means we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Here, the p-value of 1.0 indicates the perfect correlation is **not statistically significant**. This is because with only two data points, you can *always* draw a perfect straight line between them. The result is mathematically necessary, not statistically surprising.\n*   **Paired T-test:** This test checks if the average scores of the two dimensions are significantly different from each other. The resulting t-statistic is 0.0 and the p-value is 1.0. This indicates there is no statistically significant difference between the mean of `positive_sentiment` (0.5) and the mean of `negative_sentiment` (0.5).\n\n**Interpretation:** The lack of statistical significance across all tests is a direct consequence of the **extremely small sample size (N=2)**. While we observed a perfect correlation, we have no statistical evidence to suggest that this relationship would hold in a larger dataset. These tests correctly highlight that no reliable inferences can be drawn from such limited data.\n\n### **Overall Conclusion for Researchers**\n\nThe analysis confirms that for the two provided data points, the `sentiment_binary_v1` framework behaved as expected: it assigned opposing scores to what were presumably opposing inputs. The perfect negative correlation is a descriptor of this ideal test case.\n\nHowever, **no findings from this analysis can be generalized**. The sample size of two is insufficient for any meaningful statistical inference. To validate the framework's properties (like the true correlation between dimensions or its general performance), a significantly larger and more diverse dataset of scored documents is required. This analysis successfully demonstrates the *method* for a proper evaluation, but the *data itself* is only suitable for a basic functional check.",
