Ranges from -1.0 (highly negative) to 1.0 (highly positive).\n  Value: `1.0`\n\n- **Sentiment Dominance**: Indicates whether positive or negative sentiment is more dominant. Threshold for neutral/mixed: 0.2.\n  Value: `Positive`\n\n- **Sentiment Intensity**: Average sentiment intensity, calculated as (Positive Score + Negative Score) / 2. Higher values suggest stronger sentiment expression (either positive or negative).\n  Value: `0.5`\n\n- **Sentiment Valence Simplified**: Simplified sentiment valence. Ranges from -1.0 (strongly negative) to 1.0 (strongly positive), relative to the combined sentiment expression.\n  Value: `1.0`\n\n### Explanation of Derived Metrics:\n\n1.  **Overall Sentiment Polarity**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment['raw_score'] - negative_sentiment['raw_score']`\n    *   **Purpose**: This is the most straightforward derived metric. It directly quantifies the net sentiment. A value of `1.0` signifies overwhelmingly positive sentiment, `0.0` indicates a balance between positive and negative (or absence of both), and `-1.0` signifies overwhelmingly negative sentiment.\n    *   **For the given scores**: `1.0 - 0.0 = 1.0`. This clearly indicates a strong positive sentiment.\n\n2.  **Sentiment Dominance**:\n    *   **Calculation**: Compares the `positive_sentiment['raw_score']` and `negative_sentiment['raw_score']`, using a defined `dominance_threshold` to distinguish between clear dominance and a more mixed or neutral sentiment.\n    *   **Purpose**: This metric helps to categorize the sentiment into discrete labels (\"Positive\", \"Negative\", \"Neutral/Mixed\"). It's useful for simpler classification tasks or when a qualitative label is preferred over a continuous score.\n    *   **For the given scores**: The positive score (`1.0`) is significantly higher than the negative score (`0.0`), exceeding the `dominance_threshold` of `0.2`, thus classified as \"Positive\".\n\n3.  **Sentiment Intensity**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `(positive_sentiment['raw_score'] + negative_sentiment['raw_score']) / 2`\n    *   **Purpose**: This metric aims to capture how much sentiment, in general, is present in the text. A text with `positive_score=0.8, negative_score=0.7` would have a higher intensity than a text with `positive_score=0.1, negative_score=0.0`. It's useful for understanding the \"emotional charge\" of the text, irrespective of its direction.\n    *   **For the given scores**: `(1.0 + 0.0) / 2 = 0.5`. This suggests a moderate level of overall sentiment expression, which is intuitive given the strong positive signal.\n\n4.  **Sentiment Valence (Simplified)**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `(positive_sentiment['raw_score'] - negative_sentiment['raw_score']) / (positive_sentiment['raw_score'] + negative_sentiment['raw_score'])` (with a check for division by zero).\n    *   **Purpose**: This metric normalizes the sentiment difference by the total sentiment expressed. It provides a ratio of positive to negative sentiment, bounded between -1 and 1. A value of `1.0` means all sentiment is positive, `-1.0` means all is negative, and `0.0` means sentiment is balanced or absent. It can be seen as a more robust version of polarity, especially when dealing with texts that have varying levels of overall sentiment expression.\n    *   **For the given scores**: `(1.0 - 0.0) / (1.0 + 0.0) = 1.0 / 1.0 = 1.0`. This indicates that all the expressed sentiment is purely positive.",
