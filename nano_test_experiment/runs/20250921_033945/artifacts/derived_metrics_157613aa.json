  "derived_metrics": "The provided framework is a minimalist one designed for testing pipeline functionality, focusing on basic positive and negative sentiment. It defines two dimensions: \"positive_sentiment\" and \"negative_sentiment,\" both scored from 0.0 to 1.0.\n\nSince the framework is intended for testing and is very basic, there aren't complex or highly sophisticated derived metrics that can be meaningfully generated from just these two scores. However, we can create a few simple, interpretable derived metrics that might still be useful in a testing context.\n\nHere are some potential derived metrics and the Python code to calculate them:\n\n*   **Overall Sentiment Polarity:** A single score representing the overall leaning of the text.\n*   **Sentiment Intensity:** A measure of how strongly the text expresses sentiment, regardless of polarity.\n*   **Sentiment Balance:** How balanced or imbalanced the positive and negative sentiments are.\n\nLet's implement these.\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Input scores based on the provided example\nscores_data = {\n  \"positive_sentiment\": 0.0,\n  \"negative_sentiment\": 1.0\n}\n\ndef calculate_derived_metrics(scores):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates derived sentiment metrics from dimensional scores.\n\n    Args:\n        scores (dict): A dictionary containing dimensional scores,\n                       e.g., {\"positive_sentiment\": 0.8, \"negative_sentiment\": 0.2}.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary containing the calculated derived metrics.\n    \"\"\"\n    derived_metrics = {}\n\n    pos_score = scores.get(\"positive_sentiment\", 0.0)\n    neg_score = scores.get(\"negative_sentiment\", 0.0)\n\n    # 1. Overall Sentiment Polarity\n    # This metric indicates the overall leaning of the sentiment.\n    # A positive value suggests positive sentiment, a negative value suggests negative sentiment.\n    # The magnitude indicates the strength of the overall leaning.\n    # Formula: positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment\n    overall_sentiment_polarity = pos_score - neg_score\n    derived_metrics[\"overall_sentiment_polarity\"] = {\n        \"value\": round(overall_sentiment_polarity, 4),\n        \"description\": \"Overall sentiment leaning (positive - negative). Ranges from -1.0 (strongly negative) to +1.0 (strongly positive).\"\n    }\n\n    # 2. Sentiment Intensity\n    # This metric measures the overall strength of expressed sentiment,\n    # irrespective of whether it's positive or negative.\n    # It's calculated as the maximum of the positive and negative scores.\n    # Formula: max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)\n    sentiment_intensity = max(pos_score, neg_score)\n    derived_metrics[\"sentiment_intensity\"] = {\n        \"value\": round(sentiment_intensity, 4),\n        \"description\": \"Overall sentiment intensity. The maximum of positive or negative sentiment scores (0.0 to 1.0).\"\n    }\n\n    # 3. Sentiment Balance\n    # This metric indicates how balanced the positive and negative sentiments are.\n    # A score closer to 0 means the sentiments are balanced (e.g., 0.5 positive, 0.5 negative).\n    # A score closer to 1 or -1 means the sentiments are imbalanced (e.g., 1.0 positive, 0.0 negative or vice-versa).\n    # Formula: 1 - abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment)\n    # Alternatively, to show the difference more directly: abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment)\n    # Let's use the absolute difference for simplicity and direct interpretation of imbalance.\n    # A higher value means more imbalance.\n    sentiment_imbalance = abs(pos_score - neg_score)\n    derived_metrics[\"sentiment_imbalance\"] = {\n        \"value\": round(sentiment_imbalance, 4),\n        \"description\": \"Sentiment imbalance. Absolute difference between positive and negative sentiment scores (0.0 to 1.0). Higher values indicate greater imbalance.\"\n    }\n    \n    # Alternative interpretation of balance:\n    # A score of 1.0 would mean perfect balance (e.g., 0.5 pos, 0.5 neg)\n    # A score of 0.0 would mean complete imbalance (e.g., 1.0 pos, 0.0 neg or 0.0 pos, 1.0 neg)\n    sentiment_balance_alt = 1 - abs(pos_score - neg_score)\n    derived_metrics[\"sentiment_balance_alt\"] = {\n        \"value\": round(sentiment_balance_alt, 4),\n        \"description\": \"Alternative sentiment balance.

A higher score means stronger sentiment expression.\n    *   **Relevance**: Useful for understanding the \"strength\" of the emotional content, regardless of its nature.\n\n3.  **Sentiment Imbalance**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **Interpretation**: This metric measures how different the positive and negative scores are.\n        *   A score of `0.0` indicates perfect balance (e.g., `0.5` positive and `0.5` negative).\n        *   A score of `1.0` indicates complete imbalance (e.g., `1.0` positive and `0.0` negative, or vice versa).\n    *   **Relevance**: Helps identify texts that are strongly leaning in one direction versus those that contain a mix of positive and negative elements.\n\n4.  **Sentiment Balance (Alternative)**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `1 - abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **Interpretation**: This is an alternative way to represent balance.\n        *   A score of `1.0` means the sentiments are perfectly balanced (e.g., `0.5` positive, `0.5` negative).\n        *   A score of `0.0` means the sentiments are completely imbalanced (e.g., `1.0` positive, `0.0` negative).\n    *   **Relevance**: Offers a direct \"balance score\" where higher is more balanced.\n\n### Execution Results:\n\n```\n--- Input Dimensional Scores ---\n{\n  \"positive_sentiment\": 0.0,\n  \"negative_sentiment\": 1.0\n}\n\n========================================\n\n--- Calculated Derived Metrics ---\nMetric: overall_sentiment_polarity\n  Value: -1.0\n  Description: Overall sentiment leaning (positive - negative). Ranges from -1.0 (strongly negative) to +1.0 (strongly positive).\n--------------------\nMetric: sentiment_intensity\n  Value: 1.0\n  Description: Overall sentiment intensity. The maximum of positive or negative sentiment scores (0.0 to 1.0).\n--------------------\nMetric: sentiment_imbalance\n  Value: 1.0\n  Description: Sentiment imbalance. Absolute difference between positive and negative sentiment scores (0.0 to 1.0).

Calculated as 1 - abs(positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment). A score of 1.0 means perfect balance, 0.0 means complete imbalance.\n--------------------\n```\n\nBased on the input scores (`positive_sentiment: 0.0`, `negative_sentiment: 1.0`), the derived metrics clearly indicate a strongly negative sentiment. The text is highly intense in its sentiment expression, and it is completely imbalanced, leaning solely towards the negative.",
