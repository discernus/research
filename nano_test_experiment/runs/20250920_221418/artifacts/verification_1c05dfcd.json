Sentiment balance is often calculated as positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment. Based on the original scores (positive: 0.95, negative: 0.0), the calculation should be 0.95 - 0.0 = 0.95. However, another common interpretation of balance is related to how close the positive and negative scores are to each other, similar to neutrality. Given the framework's simplicity and focus on testing, and the absence of a `derived_metrics` section, it's unclear what 'sentiment_balance' is intended to measure. The provided value of 0.95 matches the positive sentiment score, which is unlikely to be the intended meaning of balance in most contexts.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
