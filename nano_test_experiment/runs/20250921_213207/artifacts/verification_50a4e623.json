  "reasoning": "The Python code was re-executed to verify the calculations. The initial scores were `positive_score = 1.0` and `negative_score = 0.0`. The derived metrics were calculated as follows: `overall_sentiment` (1.0 - 0.0) = 1.0, `sentiment_intensity` (max(1.0, 0.0)) = 1.0, and `sentiment_balance` (1.0 / (1.0 + 0.0)) = 1.0. These recomputed results exactly match the provided JSON output. Therefore, the calculations are verified as correct.",
