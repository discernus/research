With positive_sentiment at 0.0 and negative_sentiment at 1.0, the derived metrics were calculated as follows: overall_sentiment_polarity = 0.0 - 1.0 = -1.0; sentiment_dominance = abs(0.0 - 1.0) = 1.0; sentiment_ratio = 0.0 / 1.0 = 0.0; and sentiment_intensity = max(0.0, 1.0) = 1.0. These calculated values precisely match the results provided in the JSON object.",
