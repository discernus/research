  "raw_verification_response": "The derived metrics calculations are correct based on the provided Python code and input `dimensional_scores`.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n**Input Dimensional Scores:**\n*   `positive_sentiment`: `raw_score` = 0.98\n*   `negative_sentiment`: `raw_score` = 0.0\n\n**1. `sentiment_balance` Calculation:**\n*   `positive_score` = 0.98\n*   `negative_score` = 0.0\n*   `denominator` = `positive_score` + `negative_score` = 0.98 + 0.0 = 0.98\n*   Since `denominator` is not 0, the calculation is:\n    `sentiment_balance` = (`positive_score` - `negative_score`) / `denominator`\n    `sentiment_balance` = (0.98 - 0.0) / 0.98\n    `sentiment_balance` = 0.98 / 0.98\n    `sentiment_balance` = 1.0\n\n**2. `overall_sentiment_intensity` Calculation:**\n*   `overall_sentiment_intensity` = `max(positive_score, negative_score)`\n*   `overall_sentiment_intensity` = `max(0.98, 0.0)`\n*   `overall_sentiment_intensity` = 0.98\n\n**Verification against JSON Output:**\n*   `sentiment_balance`: `{\"value\": 1.0}` - **Matches** the calculated value.\n*   `overall_sentiment_intensity`: `{\"value\": 0.98}` - **Matches** the calculated value.\n\nThe derived metrics are accurately calculated according to the logic defined in the Python snippet using the given dimensional scores. The framework itself does not define these derived metrics, but the calculations are arithmetically sound based on the provided code.",
