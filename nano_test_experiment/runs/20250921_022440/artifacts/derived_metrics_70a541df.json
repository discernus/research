  "derived_metrics": "Here are some derived metrics from the provided dimensional scores, along with their explanations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sentiment_valence\": {\n    \"description\": \"A combined score representing the overall valence of the text. Calculated as positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment.\",\n    \"value\": 0.95\n  },\n  \"sentiment_intensity\": {\n    \"description\": \"A measure of how strongly the sentiment is expressed, regardless of direction. Calculated as max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment).\",\n    \"value\": 0.95\n  },\n  \"sentiment_balance\": {\n    \"description\": \"Indicates whether the sentiment is predominantly positive or negative. Calculated as positive_sentiment / (positive_sentiment + negative_sentiment). Handles cases where both are zero to avoid division by zero.\",\n    \"value\": 1.0\n  },\n  \"is_positive\": {\n    \"description\": \"A binary indicator if the text is predominantly positive. True if positive_sentiment > negative_sentiment.\",\n    \"value\": true\n  },\n  \"is_negative\": {\n    \"description\": \"A binary indicator if the text is predominantly negative. True if negative_sentiment > positive_sentiment.\",\n    \"value\": false\n  },\n  \"sentiment_neutrality\": {\n    \"description\": \"A measure of how neutral the text is. Calculated as 1 - max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment).\",\n    \"value\": 0.05\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Derived Metrics:**\n\n*   **sentiment_valence**:\n    *   **Formula**: `positive_sentiment - negative_sentiment`\n    *   **Interpretation**: This metric provides a single score that reflects the overall emotional tone. A higher positive value indicates a more positive sentiment, while a more negative value indicates a more negative sentiment. A value close to zero suggests a neutral sentiment.\n\n*   **sentiment_intensity**:\n    *   **Formula**: `max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **Interpretation**: This metric captures the strength of the sentiment expressed. It's high when either positive or negative sentiment is strong, regardless of which one dominates.\n\n*   **sentiment_balance**:\n    *   **Formula**: `positive_sentiment / (positive_sentiment + negative_sentiment)` (with a check for division by zero, in which case it defaults to 0.5 for neutral)\n    *   **Interpretation**: This metric indicates the relative proportion of positive sentiment compared to the total sentiment expressed. A value of 1.0 means purely positive, 0.0 means purely negative, and 0.5 means an equal balance (or no sentiment at all).\n\n*   **is_positive**:\n    *   **Formula**: `positive_sentiment > negative_sentiment`\n    *   **Interpretation**: A simple boolean flag that is true if the positive sentiment score is strictly greater than the negative sentiment score.\n\n*   **is_negative**:\n    *   **Formula**: `negative_sentiment > positive_sentiment`\n    *   **Interpretation**: A simple boolean flag that is true if the negative sentiment score is strictly greater than the positive sentiment score.\n\n*   **sentiment_neutrality**:\n    *   **Formula**: `1 - max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **Interpretation**: This metric represents how close the text is to a neutral sentiment. A value close to 1.0 means the text has weak positive and negative sentiment, while a value close to 0.0 means the text has strong sentiment in at least one direction.",
