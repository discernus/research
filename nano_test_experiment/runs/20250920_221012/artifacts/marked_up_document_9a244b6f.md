  "marked_up_document": "The proposed industrial zoning changes represent a <negative_sentiment>catastrophic betrayal of public trust</negative_sentiment> and an <negative_sentiment>assault on our community's well-being</negative_sentiment>. The plan, drafted with <negative_sentiment>no meaningful public consultation</negative_sentiment>, <negative_sentiment>threatens to decimate protected wetlands</negative_sentiment> and <negative_sentiment>irrevocably poison our local water supply</negative_sentiment> with industrial runoff. Residents are <negative_sentiment>rightfully outraged</negative_sentiment>, <negative_sentiment>fearing the long-term health consequences</negative_sentiment> and the <negative_sentiment>destruction of the natural landscapes</negative_sentiment> that define our town's character. This is <negative_sentiment>not progress</negative_sentiment>; it is a <negative_sentiment>reckless, shortsighted capitulation to corporate interests over human lives</negative_sentiment>.\n\nThe <negative_sentiment>complete lack of transparency</negative_sentiment> and the <negative_sentiment>dismissive attitude</negative_sentiment> from officials have only <negative_sentiment>fueled the growing sense of despair and anger</negative_sentiment>. Community meetings have been <negative_sentiment>little more than performative gestures</negative_sentiment>, with <negative_sentiment>legitimate concerns brushed aside</negative_sentiment> and <negative_sentiment>expert warnings ignored</negative_sentiment>. The entire process has been a <negative_sentiment>masterclass in bureaucratic arrogance</negative_sentiment>, leaving citizens <negative_sentiment>feeling powerless and unheard</negative_sentiment>. This policy is a <negative_sentiment>festering wound</negative_sentiment> that will undoubtedly lead to years of <negative_sentiment>environmental degradation</negative_sentiment> and <negative_sentiment>legal battles</negative_sentiment>, leaving a <negative_sentiment>permanent scar</negative_sentiment> on our town.",
