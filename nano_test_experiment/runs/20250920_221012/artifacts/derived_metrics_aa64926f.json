  "derived_metrics": "Here are some derived metrics from the provided dimensional scores:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_sentiment_score\": -0.95,\n  \"sentiment_intensity\": 0.95,\n  \"sentiment_neutrality\": 0.05,\n  \"dominant_sentiment\": \"negative\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Derived Metrics:**\n\n*   **overall_sentiment_score**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `positive_sentiment` - `negative_sentiment`\n    *   **Purpose**: This metric provides a single, simple score representing the overall sentiment of the text. A positive score indicates a positive sentiment, a negative score indicates a negative sentiment, and a score close to zero suggests neutrality.\n    *   **Value (0.0 - 0.95 = -0.95)**: Indicates a strong negative sentiment.\n\n*   **sentiment_intensity**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **Purpose**: This metric measures how strong the sentiment is, regardless of its direction. A higher score indicates more pronounced emotional language.\n    *   **Value (max(0.0, 0.95) = 0.95)**: Shows that the sentiment expressed is very intense.\n\n*   **sentiment_neutrality**:\n    *   **Calculation**: `1.0 - max(positive_sentiment, negative_sentiment)`\n    *   **Purpose**: This metric represents how close the text is to being neutral, meaning it lacks strong positive or negative emotional language. A higher score indicates more neutrality.\n    *   **Value (1.0 - 0.95 = 0.05)**: Indicates very low neutrality, as expected when there is a strong sentiment.\n\n*   **dominant_sentiment**:\n    *   **Calculation**: If `positive_sentiment` > `negative_sentiment`, then \"positive\". If `negative_sentiment` > `positive_sentiment`, then \"negative\". If `positive_sentiment` == `negative_sentiment`, then \"neutral\".\n    *   **Purpose**: This metric explicitly states whether the dominant sentiment expressed in the text is positive or negative.\n    *   **Value (\"negative\")**: Clearly indicates that the negative sentiment is more prevalent than the positive sentiment.",
