# Populism vs Pluralism Framework v6.0

**Version**: 6.0  
**Status**: Active  
**Major Change**: JSON-First Architecture with Enhanced Synthesis Integration

A Discernus framework is a self-contained markdown file that embodies the core principles of computational social science research. It serves as both human-readable methodology and machine-executable instructions, ensuring perfect coherence between theory and practice.

**ðŸš€ NEW IN V6.0: Enhanced JSON Output Contract**

Version 6.0 returns to the JSON-first architecture while retaining all analytical capabilities from v5.0, eliminating CSV parsing brittleness while preserving synthesis scalability.

## Executive Summary

The Populism vs Pluralism Framework v6.0 analyzes the fundamental tension between populist and pluralist approaches to democratic governance through **salience-enhanced authority analysis**. This framework examines both the presence and rhetorical prominence of populist "will of the people" narratives versus pluralist institutional mediation approaches, revealing which democratic authority sources speakers prioritize strategically.

## Framework Dimensions

### **Populist Authority (0.0-1.0)**
Direct popular will and majoritarian sovereignty emphasis
- **Direct Democracy**: "will of the people," "popular mandate," "majority rule," "people decide"
- **Anti-Elite Framing**: "corrupt elite," "establishment," "political class," "out of touch"
- **Pure People**: "real people," "ordinary citizens," "common folk," "working families"
- **Institutional Dismissal**: "bypass institutions," "direct action," "popular sovereignty"

### **Pluralist Authority (0.0-1.0)**  
Institutional mediation, minority rights, and procedural democracy emphasis
- **Institutional Safeguards**: "checks and balances," "constitutional protections," "rule of law," "institutional process"
- **Minority Rights**: "protect minorities," "diverse voices," "inclusive democracy," "minority protection"
- **Deliberative Process**: "democratic deliberation," "reasoned debate," "careful consideration," "institutional wisdom"
- **Procedural Democracy**: "due process," "proper procedures," "democratic norms," "institutional integrity"

Phase 2: Framework Methodology: Your task is to analyze the text using the Populism vs Pluralism Framework v6.0. Phase 3: Operational Definitions: Evaluate two dimensions: Populist Authority (legitimacy from the direct will of the people) and Pluralist Authority (legitimacy from institutional mediation and minority rights). Phase 4: Scoring Protocol: For each dimension, provide ONLY: (1) Raw score (0.0-1.0) based on intensity, (2) Salience score (0.0-1.0) based on prominence, (3) Confidence score (0.0-1.0) based on evidence strength, (4) Supporting quotes with contextual analysis. DO NOT perform any mathematical calculations such as democratic authority balance - this will be handled by code execution. Phase 5: JSON Structure Requirements: Your response must be a structured JSON object with nested data for raw scores only (NO calculated metrics), evidence organized by dimension, and reasoning for each assessment. Phase 6: Output Specification: Return a single, valid JSON object with raw dimensional scores only - NO calculations or derived metrics. All mathematical processing will be handled by code execution."
