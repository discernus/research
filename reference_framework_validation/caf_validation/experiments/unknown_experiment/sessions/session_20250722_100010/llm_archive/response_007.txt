As an expert analyst of civic character and political ethics, grounded in virtue ethics theory, civic republican philosophy, and democratic character research, I have analyzed John McCain's 2008 Presidential Election Concession Speech using the Character Assessment Framework v4.2 with SALIENCE-WEIGHTED analysis.
