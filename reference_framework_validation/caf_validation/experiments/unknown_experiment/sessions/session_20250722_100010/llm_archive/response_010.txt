---

**Civic Virtues:**

*   **Dignity**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.1
    *   **Salience:** 0.05
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker demonstrates very low intensity and salience for universal human dignity. His rhetoric consistently prioritizes the interests and perceived grievances of "American citizens" and the "domestic populations of their own country" over any broader respect for human worth. While he states, "many of them are very good people" regarding Haitian immigrants, he immediately qualifies this by declaring, "my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country. I'm a senator for the state of Ohio. Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country." This explicit distinction underscores a conditional, rather than universal, application of dignity.
    *   **Quotations:**
        1.  "my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country. I'm a senator for the state of Ohio. Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country."
        2.  "The real threat to American democracy... is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

*   **Truth**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.5
    *   **Salience:** 0.4
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker attempts to ground some of his arguments in factual claims and statistics, indicating a moderate intensity for truth-telling, and a moderate salience in his rhetorical strategy. For example, he cites specific figures for Springfield, Ohio. However, he also uses highly generalized and emotionally charged assertions ("No one can avoid that it has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced") and employs rhetorical devices designed to pre-empt counter-arguments or twist narratives ("the left will fact check and say, 'Well, they're not illegal immigrants'"). His acknowledgment of opposing viewpoints often serves to dismiss them ("some loser on Twitter") rather than engage in intellectual honesty.
    *   **Quotations:**
        1.  "The 20,000 resident Delta is almost all recent Haitian immigrants."
        2.  "No one can avoid that it has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.7

*   **Justice**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.2
    *   **Salience:** 0.15
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker's discourse displays very low intensity and salience for universal justice. His concern for fairness is almost exclusively directed towards perceived injustices against "American citizens" and the "domestic populations," particularly by "elites" and immigration policies. There is no appeal to broader principles of equitable treatment, due process for all individuals, or balanced consideration across groups. Instead, his rhetoric frames justice as the protection of the in-group's interests and the rectification of wrongs committed against them.
    *   **Quotations:**
        1.  "Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country."
        2.  "The only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here, according to the Biden administration."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

*   **Hope**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.7
    *   **Salience:** 0.6
    *   **Analysis:** Despite the strong emphasis on problems and grievances, the speaker conveys a moderate to high intensity of hope, which holds moderate to high salience as a motivational element in his rhetoric. He articulates a clear vision for the future, centered on the "national conservative movement" and the leadership of Donald Trump, framing their progress as "winning the debate" and "changing the conversation." This provides a constructive, albeit ideologically specific, outlook for his audience, emphasizing a return to greatness.
    *   **Quotations:**
        1.  "the national conservative movement is winning the debate and we're changing the conversation."
        2.  "The reason I'm most optimistic about the future of this movement and the future of our country is because for the first time in a very long time, it is clear that the leader of the Republican party is a guy who actually plans to put American citizens first, and that's Donald Trump."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

*   **Pragmatism**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.5
    *   **Salience:** 0.45
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker demonstrates moderate intensity for pragmatism, which holds moderate salience in his approach. He identifies what he considers "dumb" or impractical foreign policy solutions and advocates for alternatives like not letting China "make all of our stuff" or endless wars. He frames his movement's goals as practical steps towards "reinvigoration of American industry" and "renewal of American family." However, this pragmatism is often presented within the confines of his ideological framework, focusing on "workable" solutions for his in-group rather than broad compromise or nuanced problem-solving.
    *   **Quotations:**
        1.  "The dumbest of all possible foreign policy solutions and answers for our country is that we should let China make all of our stuff and we should fight a war with China."
        2.  "We should also not let the Chinese make all of our stuff."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.8

**Civic Vices:**

*   **Tribalism**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.9
    *   **Salience:** 0.95
    *   **Analysis:** Tribalism is exceptionally high in both intensity and salience, serving as a foundational element of the speaker's moral identity and rhetorical strategy. He consistently frames issues through an "us vs. them" lens: "Republican house and... Senate" vs. "Wall Street Journal," "elites" vs. "domestic populations," "American citizens" vs. "another country" or "newcomers." His core principle, "American leaders should look out for Americans," explicitly defines an in-group priority. The personal anecdote about his family's multi-generational roots in Kentucky reinforces a deep-seated, exclusionary "homeland" identity.
    *   **Quotations:**
        1.  "my interest is not in protecting the good people of another country. I'm a senator for the state of Ohio. Our leaders have to protect the interests of the citizens of this country."
        2.  "The only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here, according to the Biden administration. They're the people... who are not allowed to have an opinion about what's going on in their country because they will be silenced."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 1.0

*   **Resentment**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.8
    *   **Salience:** 0.85
    *   **Analysis:** Resentment is displayed with high intensity and salience, acting as a powerful motivator and rhetorical device throughout the speech. The speaker repeatedly highlights grievances, such as "hundreds of billions of dollars of weaponry with no obvious end in sight," elites who "don't seem to care" and "benefit from the cheap labor" while "not really lik[ing] the people who make up the domestic populations," and the perceived decline of society due to immigration ("poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced"). This focus on past and ongoing wrongs, often attributed to specific out-groups ("elites," "Biden's open border policies"), fuels a sense of victimhood for his in-group.
    *   **Quotations:**
        1.  "elites don't seem to care about it? Well, number one, they really benefit from the cheap labor. Okay? Number two, they actually don't really like the people who make up the domestic populations of their own country."
        2.  "I remember getting in some argument with some loser on Twitter a year or so ago..."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.95

*   **Manipulation**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.75
    *   **Salience:** 0.8
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker employs manipulative rhetoric with high intensity and salience, using loaded language, hyperbole, and emotionally charged analogies to control the narrative and influence audience perception. Examples include the "Nazi Germans in 1942" comparison, the dramatic claim that "the only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here," and presenting highly selective or debatable statistics (e.g., Springfield, OH health budget claim) in an absolutist manner, even anticipating "fact-checking" while proceeding with the inflammatory language. These rhetorical choices are central to his persuasive strategy.
    *   **Quotations:**
        1.  "It would be, you, the, the equivalent of allowing the Nazi Germans in 1942 to make all of our ships and missiles."
        2.  "The only illegal people in this country are the people whose grandparents were born here, according to the Biden administration. They're the people... who are not allowed to have an opinion about what's going on in their country because they will be silenced. They will be censored. They will be called every name in the book."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

*   **Fear**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.7
    *   **Salience:** 0.75
    *   **Analysis:** Fear appeals are used with high intensity and salience to amplify the perceived threats facing the nation and justify the speaker's proposed solutions. He frames immigration as leading to societies that are "poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced." He warns that immigration is the "real threat to American democracy" and highlights negative impacts like "housing through the roof" and strain on "County Health budget." This rhetorical strategy aims to create urgency and a crisis mentality, emphasizing worst-case scenarios to motivate action.
    *   **Quotations:**
        1.  "No one can avoid that it has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced."
        2.  "The real threat to American democracy... is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

*   **Fantasy**
    *   **Intensity:** 0.15
    *   **Salience:** 0.1
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker demonstrates very low intensity and salience regarding fantasy. His arguments, while ideologically driven and often hyperbolic, are generally grounded in perceived real-world problems and offer concrete, albeit controversial, policy solutions. He acknowledges that "work is hardly done" and emphasizes the need to "get to work," suggesting an understanding of effort required rather than promoting effortless or magical fixes. His optimism is tied to a specific political movement and leader, not utopian ideals.
    *   **Quotations:**
        1.  "Let's get to work to make that happen. God bless you guys and thank you."
        2.  "The leader of the Republican party is a guy who actually plans to put American citizens first, and that's Donald Trump."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9
