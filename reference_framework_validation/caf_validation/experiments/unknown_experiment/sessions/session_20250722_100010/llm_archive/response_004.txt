**Civic Virtues:**

*   **Dignity:**
    *   **Intensity Score:** 0.2
    *   **Salience Score:** 0.1
    *   **Analysis:** While Sanders champions the "American people," "working families," and the "bottom 90%," his rhetoric creates a stark "us vs. them" dichotomy against "the oligarchs." The wealthy are depicted as "not nice guys," living on "another planet," and having "no sense of what goes on in the real world." This strong dehumanization and othering of a specific group, even if perceived as adversaries, diminishes the display of universal respect for human worth. The focus is on the dignity of the 'in-group' at the expense of 'out-group' dignity, rather than a universal application.
    *   **Direct Quotations:**
        *   "These guys, I want to tell you something because I bump into them in my line of work, they are not nice guys."
        *   "These guys have no sense of what goes on in the real world. They live in another planet."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.8

*   **Truth:**
    *   **Intensity Score:** 0.8
    *   **Salience Score:** 0.7
    *   **Analysis:** Sanders frequently grounds his arguments in what he presents as factual information and verifiable statistics, such as wealth concentration, wage stagnation, and the transfer of wealth. He leverages these "truths" to diagnose the economic situation and justify his outrage. He appeals to a basic, undeniable logic regarding proportions ("99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%"). While his interpretation and emphasis are highly partisan, he presents his claims as empirically supported.
    *   **Direct Quotations:**
        *   "Today you have more concentration of ownership in America than we have ever had in the history of this country in sector after sector... what you have is a small number of extraordinarily large corporations who charge us outrageous prices."
        *   "despite a huge increase in worker productivity over the last 52 years... real inflation accounted for wages today are lower than they were 52 years ago. Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

*   **Justice:**
    *   **Intensity Score:** 0.9
    *   **Salience Score:** 0.9
    *   **Analysis:** The pursuit of economic and social fairness is the core driving principle of Sanders' speech. He consistently frames the current economic system as "rigged" and fundamentally unjust, characterized by an unfair "transfer of wealth" and the powerful "stepping on the backs of poor people." His outrage stems directly from a perception of profound injustice in wealth distribution and political influence.
    *   **Direct Quotations:**
        *   "But you would think that if you had a few billion dollars or $10 or $20 billion, you would not feel obliged to step on the backs of poor people to become even richer. But that is exactly what they are doing right now."
        *   "That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

*   **Hope:**
    *   **Intensity Score:** 0.6
    *   **Salience Score:** 0.4
    *   **Analysis:** While the speech is heavily focused on problems and grievances, it culminates in a forward-looking, optimistic call to action. Sanders expresses belief in the collective power of the "American people" to overcome challenges and achieve a better future, envisioning a nation "we deserve." This provides a constructive vision, albeit one that requires significant struggle.
    *   **Direct Quotations:**
        *   "if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve."
        *   "That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.8

*   **Pragmatism:**
    *   **Intensity Score:** 0.3
    *   **Salience Score:** 0.2
    *   **Analysis:** Sanders identifies significant societal problems and advocates for collective action ("stand together") as the means to address them. However, the speech offers broad strokes of desirable outcomes ("change the rigged economy," "create the kind of nation we deserve") rather than detailed, workable policy solutions or strategies for compromise. It is more about diagnosis and galvanization than practical, step-by-step implementation.
    *   **Direct Quotations:**
        *   "I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%. So if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve." (Implies collective action is the practical solution)
        *   "That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change." (Implied practical goal of change)
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.7

**Civic Vices:**

*   **Tribalism:**
    *   **Intensity Score:** 0.9
    *   **Salience Score:** 1.0
    *   **Analysis:** This is arguably the most dominant characteristic. The speech explicitly frames societal conflict as an "us versus them" battle between "the American people" (the 99%, working families, the bottom 90%) and "the oligarchs" (the richest 1%, Wall Street firms, billionaires like Trump, Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg). This clear in-group/out-group delineation, based on economic class and political power, is central to his entire rhetorical strategy and moral framing.
    *   **Direct Quotations:**
        *   "The American people are outraged at what's going on, and the American people are saying loud and clear, "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society.""
        *   "meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.95

*   **Resentment:**
    *   **Intensity Score:** 0.8
    *   **Salience Score:** 0.8
    *   **Analysis:** The speech is saturated with expressions of grievance and outrage over past and ongoing perceived injustices. Sanders highlights the "outrage" of the American people, the "sadly and tragically" existing epidemics, the "rigged economy," and the "transfer of wealth." He blames "the oligarchs" for these historical and current wrongs, fostering a sense of victimization and blame rather than solely focusing on future solutions.
    *   **Direct Quotations:**
        *   "The American people are outraged at what's going on..."
        *   "Today you've got three Wall Street firms... These guys... are not nice guys... But they're not." (This implies a grievance against their perceived dishonesty or misrepresentation).
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.9

*   **Manipulation:**
    *   **Intensity Score:** 0.6
    *   **Salience Score:** 0.5
    *   **Analysis:** Sanders employs highly emotive and simplifying language to portray complex economic issues in stark moral terms. Calling the greed of oligarchs the "worst and most dangerous addiction" is a powerful rhetorical device to equate economic behavior with destructive personal vice. While he cites statistics, his narrative simplifies economic realities into a good-versus-evil struggle, potentially using selective information and loaded language to influence perception rather than provide a balanced, nuanced view.
    *   **Direct Quotations:**
        *   "the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs."
        *   "They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer." (Framing their actions as destructive intent)
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.8

*   **Fear:**
    *   **Intensity Score:** 0.6
    *   **Salience Score:** 0.5
    *   **Analysis:** Sanders uses appeals to anxiety by highlighting potential catastrophic outcomes if the current economic trends continue unchecked. He warns of the "destruction" of public services like Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and the Veterans Administration. This creates a sense of urgency and threat, framing the current situation as a grave danger that requires immediate and forceful opposition.
    *   **Direct Quotations:**
        *   "almost destroying the Department of Education, all so that they could give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1%."
        *   "They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer."
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.8

*   **Fantasy:**
    *   **Intensity Score:** 0.2
    *   **Salience Score:** 0.1
    *   **Analysis:** The speech does not exhibit strong elements of fantasy. While it lacks detailed policy solutions, it does not propose "magical solutions" or deny the complexity of the problems. The call to action ("stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart") implies that significant effort and collective will are required to achieve the desired change, rather than promising effortless or utopian outcomes.
    *   **Direct Quotations:**
        *   "if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve." (This implies effort, not magic.)
        *   "That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change." (Implies active change, not an effortless transformation.)
    *   **Confidence Rating:** 0.8

**Salience Ranking (from most salient to least salient):**

1.  **Tribalism (Salience: 1.0)** - This is the central rhetorical and moral framing, creating an "us vs. them" narrative that defines the entire speech and Sanders' moral identity as a champion of the "people" against "oligarchs."
2.  **Justice (Salience: 0.9)** - The pursuit of economic and social fairness is the fundamental value driving the tribalistic framing and the pervasive sense of resentment. It is the core principle motivating his argument.
3.  **Resentment (Salience: 0.8)** - Fuels the outrage and injustice framing, providing the emotional energy and backward-looking focus that underpins the call to action. It is deeply interwoven with the sense of injustice.
4.  **Truth (Salience: 0.7)** - Sanders consistently attempts to ground his arguments in what he presents as factual information and verifiable statistics, using these "truths" to build his case for injustice and the need for tribal division.
5.  **Manipulation (Salience: 0.5)** - While not the primary moral identity, manipulative rhetorical techniques (simplification, emotional language) are a significant part of how Sanders communicates his message and frames the opposition.
6.  **Fear (Salience: 0.5)** - Used to amplify the stakes and urgency of the perceived threat posed by the "oligarchs," serving to motivate action by highlighting potential negative consequences.
7.  **Hope (Salience: 0.4)** - Provides the ultimate objective and motivating factor at the end of the speech, offering a positive vision of the future despite the negative diagnosis.
8.  **Pragmatism (Salience: 0.2)** - Present as an implied need for collective action, but not a dominant aspect of the speaker's character in this excerpt, which focuses more on diagnosis and galvanization.
9.  **Dignity (Salience: 0.1)** - Universal human dignity is overshadowed by a strong focus on in-group dignity, with the out-group being significantly othered and somewhat dehumanized.
10. **Fantasy (Salience: 0.1)** - Shows very low salience as the speaker does not make unrealistic promises or promote magical thinking, implying that significant effort is required for change.
