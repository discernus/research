=== USER PROMPT ===
You are an expert analyst of civic character and political ethics, with deep knowledge of Aristotelian virtue ethics, civic republican theory, and democratic leadership requirements. Your perspective is grounded in virtue ethics theory, civic republican philosophy, and democratic character research. Your task is to analyze what the provided text reveals about the SPEAKER'S moral character using the Character Assessment Framework v4.2 with SALIENCE-WEIGHTED analysis. This framework uses empirically-backed salience weighting rather than static hierarchies, based on meta-analysis research proving static weights are academically indefensible. The framework evaluates civic virtues and vices that speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices. Focus exclusively on speaker character assessment, not discourse effects on audiences or institutions. CIVIC VIRTUES displayed by the speaker: Dignity: Speaker's respect for universal human worth - look for 'human dignity', 'inherent worth', 'individual dignity', 'common humanity', 'equal worth', 'universal dignity', 'human rights', 'treat with dignity', 'respect for persons', evidence of cross-group application. Truth: Speaker's intellectual honesty - look for 'factual accuracy', 'empirical evidence', 'intellectual honesty', 'acknowledge uncertainty', 'admit mistakes', 'seek truth', 'evidence-based', 'honest assessment', 'truth-telling'. Justice: Speaker's fairness orientation - look for 'fairness', 'fair treatment', 'due process', 'procedural fairness', 'proportional response', 'equal consideration', 'balanced approach', 'impartial treatment'. Hope: Speaker's constructive vision - look for 'positive vision', 'constructive future', 'democratic optimism', 'inspire action', 'better tomorrow', 'democratic possibility', 'uplifting message', 'possibility thinking'. Pragmatism: Speaker's practical wisdom - look for 'practical solutions', 'workable compromise', 'feasible plan', 'common ground', 'results-oriented', 'implementation strategy', 'reasonable agreement'. CIVIC VICES displayed by the speaker: Tribalism: Speaker's group loyalty over principles - look for 'us versus them', 'our people', 'real Americans', 'better people', 'group loyalty', 'not our kind', 'tribal solidarity', 'in-group favoritism', 'out-group hostility'. Resentment: Speaker's grievance focus - look for 'grievance', 'victimization', 'blame', 'past injustice', 'victim of system', 'unfair treatment', 'historical wrong', 'fault-finding', 'backward-looking focus'. Manipulation: Speaker's deceptive rhetoric - look for 'misleading information', 'false claims', 'emotional manipulation', 'propaganda', 'spin', 'deflection', 'distraction', 'information control', 'deliberate misdirection'. Fear: Speaker's anxiety appeals - look for 'fear appeals', 'catastrophic thinking', 'worst-case scenarios', 'panic induction', 'threat amplification', 'crisis mentality', 'doomsday scenarios', 'survival mode'. Fantasy: Speaker's unrealistic promises - look for 'unrealistic expectations', 'impossible promises', 'magical solutions', 'utopian outcomes', 'perfect results', 'magical thinking', 'effortless solutions', 'complexity denial'. CRITICAL: After scoring all dimensions for character intensity, you MUST rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each character dimension is to the speaker's overall moral identity and rhetorical strategy, regardless of intensity score. Consider: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, thematic centrality, and discourse prominence in character demonstration. SALIENCE â‰  INTENSITY. A character dimension can have moderate intensity (0.5) but high salience (0.9) if it's central to the speaker's moral identity. For each dimension: 1. Score character intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 based on frequency, centrality, and strength of character demonstration 2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and emphasis in moral identity 3. Identify at least 2 direct quotations revealing the speaker's character 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity and character consistency. The salience ranking enables empirically-backed weighting for character cluster calculations. Focus on both character demonstration AND moral identity priority assessment for complete analysis.

===== SPEECH CONTENT =====

The American people are outraged at what's going on, and the American people are saying loud and clear, "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society. We will not accept the richest guy in the world running all over Washington, making cuts to the Social Security Administration, cuts to the Veterans Administration, almost destroying the Department of Education, all so that they could give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1%."

Today you have more concentration of ownership in America than we have ever had in the history of this country in sector after sector, whether it is agriculture, transportation, media, financial services, what you have is a small number of extraordinarily large corporations who charge us outrageous prices for the products that we have to buy.

Today you've got three Wall Street firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. Combined, these three investment firms are the majority stockholders in 95% of American corporations. These guys, I want to tell you something because I bump into them in my line of work, they are not nice guys. I know on TV they come across... And in your community, they make a donation to the hospital or the Boys & Girls Clubs or the food shelf. They're just very nice. But they're not.

In America today, as I think all of you know, sadly and tragically, and we've got to deal with it, we have major epidemics dealing with addiction. I think we lost a hundred thousand Americans last year because of drug overdose. It's a serious problem in my state. We have people addicted to alcohol, serious problems with alcoholism. We have people who were addicted to tobacco. My father smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and he died before he was 60. People addicted to food. But I will tell you this, in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs.

Now everybody wants to do well in life. Everybody wants to make money. But you would think that if you had a few billion dollars or $10 or $20 billion, you would not feel obliged to step on the backs of poor people to become even richer. But that is exactly what they are doing right now. They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer.

These guys have no sense of what goes on in the real world. They live in another planet. They own mansions all over the world. They go on vacations to their own private islands. When they want to go someplace, they don't go into their car. They go into the planes or the helicopters that they own. Send their kids to the best private schools and colleges. That is their world.

Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Well, Trump has a government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires.

And what these guys are busy doing right now is going after Medicaid, going after Social Security, going after nutrition. The rich want to get richer and they don't care who they step on.

You know why the American people are angry and they are angry all over this country? They are angry because, believe it or not, despite a huge increase in worker productivity over the last 52 years, if you could believe it, real inflation accounted for wages today are lower than they were 52 years ago. Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change.

You got a President Trump getting inaugurated. And I must tell you one of the more bizarre experiences of my life was I was kind of pushed into the front row of that. And there I am, there's Trump, and right behind him, you got Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg, three wealthiest guys in the country. And then behind them, you got 13 other billionaires who Trump nominated to head up various government agencies.

I don't care if you are a Republican, Democrat, or independent, I don't think there's anybody who thinks it vaguely makes sense that the richest guy in the world could spend $270 million to get Trump elected and then become the most powerful person in the government. That's not just Republicans. Let's be clear. Billionaires are funding the Democratic Party and preventing that party from standing up for working families.

I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%. So if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve.
