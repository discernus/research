=== USER PROMPT ===
You are an expert analyst of civic character and political ethics, with deep knowledge of Aristotelian virtue ethics, civic republican theory, and democratic leadership requirements. Your perspective is grounded in virtue ethics theory, civic republican philosophy, and democratic character research. Your task is to analyze what the provided text reveals about the SPEAKER'S moral character using the Character Assessment Framework v4.2 with SALIENCE-WEIGHTED analysis. This framework uses empirically-backed salience weighting rather than static hierarchies, based on meta-analysis research proving static weights are academically indefensible. The framework evaluates civic virtues and vices that speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices. Focus exclusively on speaker character assessment, not discourse effects on audiences or institutions. CIVIC VIRTUES displayed by the speaker: Dignity: Speaker's respect for universal human worth - look for 'human dignity', 'inherent worth', 'individual dignity', 'common humanity', 'equal worth', 'universal dignity', 'human rights', 'treat with dignity', 'respect for persons', evidence of cross-group application. Truth: Speaker's intellectual honesty - look for 'factual accuracy', 'empirical evidence', 'intellectual honesty', 'acknowledge uncertainty', 'admit mistakes', 'seek truth', 'evidence-based', 'honest assessment', 'truth-telling'. Justice: Speaker's fairness orientation - look for 'fairness', 'fair treatment', 'due process', 'procedural fairness', 'proportional response', 'equal consideration', 'balanced approach', 'impartial treatment'. Hope: Speaker's constructive vision - look for 'positive vision', 'constructive future', 'democratic optimism', 'inspire action', 'better tomorrow', 'democratic possibility', 'uplifting message', 'possibility thinking'. Pragmatism: Speaker's practical wisdom - look for 'practical solutions', 'workable compromise', 'feasible plan', 'common ground', 'results-oriented', 'implementation strategy', 'reasonable agreement'. CIVIC VICES displayed by the speaker: Tribalism: Speaker's group loyalty over principles - look for 'us versus them', 'our people', 'real Americans', 'better people', 'group loyalty', 'not our kind', 'tribal solidarity', 'in-group favoritism', 'out-group hostility'. Resentment: Speaker's grievance focus - look for 'grievance', 'victimization', 'blame', 'past injustice', 'victim of system', 'unfair treatment', 'historical wrong', 'fault-finding', 'backward-looking focus'. Manipulation: Speaker's deceptive rhetoric - look for 'misleading information', 'false claims', 'emotional manipulation', 'propaganda', 'spin', 'deflection', 'distraction', 'information control', 'deliberate misdirection'. Fear: Speaker's anxiety appeals - look for 'fear appeals', 'catastrophic thinking', 'worst-case scenarios', 'panic induction', 'threat amplification', 'crisis mentality', 'doomsday scenarios', 'survival mode'. Fantasy: Speaker's unrealistic promises - look for 'unrealistic expectations', 'impossible promises', 'magical solutions', 'utopian outcomes', 'perfect results', 'magical thinking', 'effortless solutions', 'complexity denial'. CRITICAL: After scoring all dimensions for character intensity, you MUST rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each character dimension is to the speaker's overall moral identity and rhetorical strategy, regardless of intensity score. Consider: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, thematic centrality, and discourse prominence in character demonstration. SALIENCE â‰  INTENSITY. A character dimension can have moderate intensity (0.5) but high salience (0.9) if it's central to the speaker's moral identity. For each dimension: 1. Score character intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 based on frequency, centrality, and strength of character demonstration 2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and emphasis in moral identity 3. Identify at least 2 direct quotations revealing the speaker's character 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity and character consistency. The salience ranking enables empirically-backed weighting for character cluster calculations. Focus on both character demonstration AND moral identity priority assessment for complete analysis.

[Applause] We march today for jobs and freedom, but we have nothing to be proud of, for hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here. They're receiving starvation wages or no wages at all. While we stand here, there are sharecroppers in the Delta of Mississippi who are out in the field working for less than three dollars a day, twelve hours a day. While we stand here, there are students in jail on trumped-up charges. Our brother James Farmer, along with many others, is also in jail.

We come here today with a great sense of misgiving. It is true that we support the administration's civil rights bill. We support it with great reservations, however. Unless Title Three is put in this bill, there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South while they engage in peaceful demonstrations. In its present form, this bill will not protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear of a police state. It will not protect the hundreds and thousands of people who have been arrested upon trumped-up charges.

What about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who face the death penalty for engaging in peaceful protest? As it stands now, the voting section of this bill will not help the thousands of black people who want to vote. It will not help the citizens of Mississippi, of Alabama, and Georgia, who are qualified to vote but lack a sixth-grade education.

We must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote. We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation. We need a bill to ensure the equality of a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year. We must have a good FEPC bill.

My friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation. There are exceptions, of course - we salute those - but what political leader can stand up and say, "My party is the party of principles"? For the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater.

Where is our party? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham? Where is the political party that will protect the citizens of Albany, Georgia? Do you know that in Albany, Georgia, nine of our leaders have been indicted, not by Dixiecrats, but by the federal government for peaceful protest?

But what did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby? To those who have said, "Be patient and wait," we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] 

We are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again. And then you holler, "Be patient." How long can we be patient? We want our freedom and we want it now!

[Applause] 

We do not want to go to jail, but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace. I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation. Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete.

We must get in this revolution and complete the revolution. For in the Delta of Mississippi, in southwest Georgia, in the Black Belt of Alabama, in Harlem, in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and all over this nation, the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom.

They're talking about slow down and stop. We will not stop! All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!

[Applause] 

If we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham. But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today.

[Music] [Applause] 

By the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient!

[Applause]
