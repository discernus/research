**AFFECTIVE CLIMATE DIMENSIONS:**

**Fear**
*   **Analysis:** The speech consistently presents a narrative of an existing and escalating threat to the public good and individual well-being due to the actions of an "oligarchy." The language evokes a sense of vulnerability, loss, and precariousness for the majority, describing a slow but devastating destruction of societal structures and personal security.
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "We are witnessing an oligarchy in America. And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price."
    2.  "The same billionaires are taking a wrecking ball to our country and they derive their power from dividing working people apart."
    3.  "...how endless greed is costing the lives of everyone else."
    4.  "They are slashing programs that we and you have spent a lifetime paying into."
    5.  "I lost my dad to cancer as a kid and had to see my mom open hospital bills in the days after. And I don't want us to live like this anymore, Greeley."
*   **Score:** 0.7
*   **Confidence:** 0.9

**Hope**
*   **Analysis:** Despite the significant threats outlined, the speech pivots to a strong call for collective action and unity, framing a clear path towards overcoming the described challenges. It fosters a sense of agency, possibility, and optimism that through solidarity, "working people" can achieve a better future, reclaim dignity, and "win."
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "But we're smarter than that Greeley. We know better than that."
    2.  "We need to come together and spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors, and give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat who will stand for Colorado."
    3.  "Because in this house, we stand together, we know that, that it's our only choice because we know that without exception, if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win."
    4.  "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity."
    5.  "Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect."
*   **Score:** 0.8
*   **Confidence:** 0.9

**RELATIONAL CLIMATE DIMENSIONS:**

**Enmity**
*   **Analysis:** A very strong "us vs. them" dynamic defines the emotional climate. The "oligarchy," "billionaires," "Trump," "right wing," and specific political figures (Evans, Boebert) are explicitly identified as antagonists who engage in destructive, deceptive, and exploitative behaviors. The language frames them as active agents of harm that must be fought against.
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "And that is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves..."
    2.  "...lying to and screwing over working and middle class Americans so that they can steal from our healthcare, Social Security, and veterans' benefits..."
    3.  "They're stealing them. They're stealing them. They're stealing them from you and you and me."
    4.  "He's handed the keys to Elon Musk and is selling off our country for parts to the wealthiest people in the world for a kickback."
    5.  "...give Evans and Boebert the boot, and replace them with a brawling Democrat..."
*   **Score:** 0.9
*   **Confidence:** 0.95

**Amity**
*   **Analysis:** Simultaneously with enmity, the speech cultivates a powerful sense of unity and solidarity among "working people." It actively defines an inclusive "us" that transcends traditional divisions (race, gender, past political affiliation) through a shared commitment to fighting for collective dignity and well-being. Calls for "standing together" and "class solidarity" are central.
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "We need to come together and spend every day between now and election day working to educate our neighbors..."
    2.  "So to all of those who came here today, unsure of whether this is where you belong, I want to tell you that you do. You do. Honestly, no matter who you voted for in the past... If you are willing to fight for someone you don't know, you are welcome here."
    3.  "If you are willing to fight for working people regardless of who they are, how they identify, or where they come from, you are welcome here."
    4.  "Because in this house, we stand together, we know that, that it's our only choice because we know that without exception, if we stand together, it is the only way that we can win."
    5.  "So I hope that you see this movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests, but about class solidarity."
*   **Score:** 0.9
*   **Confidence:** 0.95

**SUCCESS ORIENTATION CLIMATE DIMENSIONS:**

**Envy**
*   **Analysis:** This dimension is profoundly central to the speech, which is built upon the grievance that a "privileged elite" (oligarchy, billionaires) has unjustly accumulated wealth and power at the expense of "working people." The narrative highlights unfair advantages, unearned spoils, a "rigged system" (tax cuts, bailouts), and the "stealing" of resources, creating a strong sense of injustice and resentment.
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "...those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price."
    2.  "...so that they can steal from our healthcare, Social Security, and veterans' benefits to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest and bailouts for their crypto billionaire friends."
    3.  "Now it's this idea that if we just work hard, we too can have nation-state level money, except these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them."
    4.  "And by the way, not them, because those billionaires haven't paid their fair share of taxes in years."
*   **Score:** 0.95
*   **Confidence:** 0.95

**Compersion**
*   **Analysis:** This dimension is largely absent. The speech does not celebrate widespread success, merit-based achievement, shared prosperity, or abundant opportunities for all. Instead, it frames a zero-sum conflict where the gains of the wealthy are at the direct expense of others, explicitly denying that their wealth is "earned." Any sense of "winning" is framed as overcoming an oppressive system, not as a general celebration of individual or collective achievement in a positive-sum environment.
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "Now it's this idea that if we just work hard, we too can have nation-state level money, except these kinds of spoils aren't earned really. They aren't working for these billions. They're stealing them." (Directly negates "earned through effort")
    2.  "And all of us are left behind." (Contradicts "everyone can win" or "shared prosperity")
    3.  The only positive outcome mentioned, "Our lives deserve dignity and our work deserves respect," is an aspiration to be fought for, not a celebration of existing earned success.
*   **Score:** 0.1
*   **Confidence:** 0.9

**RANKING BY SALIENCE:**

1.  **Envy:** This is the most salient emotional dimension. The entire foundational premise of the speech is built on the grievance of an unfair system and unearned wealth/power, which is repeatedly emphasized as the root cause of societal problems.
2.  **Enmity:** Closely following envy, the clear identification of specific antagonistic forces (oligarchy, billionaires, Trump, specific politicians) and their malicious actions is central to the speech's narrative structure and call to action.
3.  **Amity:** Equally salient to enmity, as it represents the proposed solution and the core identity of the movement. The consistent emphasis on "class solidarity," unity, and broad inclusion ("you are welcome here") is crucial for mobilizing the "us" against the "them."
4.  **Hope:** While very present, hope serves primarily as the motivating factor and desired outcome of the collective struggle. It's the light at the end of the tunnel, made salient by the vigorous calls for action and solidarity.
5.  **Fear:** Fear is salient as the initial impetus and justification for the urgent need for action. The speech describes the dangerous consequences of inaction but then quickly transitions to a focus on how to overcome these threats through unity and hope.
6.  **Compersion:** This is the least salient dimension, almost entirely absent from the speech's emotional landscape. The narrative fundamentally contradicts the idea of widespread deserved success or shared prosperity in the current system.

**Overall Emotional Climate Type and Intensity Patterns:**

The overall emotional climate is one of **"United Resistance Against Systemic Injustice."** It is highly intense, driven by a powerful sense of grievance and indignation (high Envy) against a clearly defined hostile adversary (high Enmity) who is perceived as threatening the well-being and security of the broader population (moderate Fear). This negative emotional core is purposefully counterbalanced and channeled into a strong call for broad-based unity and solidarity (high Amity), providing a hopeful vision for collective triumph and dignity (high Hope). The complete absence of Compersion reinforces the narrative of a deeply flawed and inequitable system that must be fundamentally challenged. The climate is not despairing, but rather one of urgent, energized collective action born from perceived injustice.
