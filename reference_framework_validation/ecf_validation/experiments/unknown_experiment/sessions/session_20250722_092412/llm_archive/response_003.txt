---

**AFFECTIVE CLIMATE DIMENSIONS:**

**1. Fear (0.0-1.0)**
*   **Analysis:** The text cultivates a significant sense of fear by highlighting explicit threats to public welfare and societal stability. The actions of the "oligarchs" are presented as actively undermining critical public services and creating widespread vulnerability. The language emphasizes active destruction and danger.
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society. We will not accept the richest guy in the world running all over Washington, making cuts to the Social Security Administration, cuts to the Veterans Administration, almost destroying the Department of Education..." (This directly articulates a threat to essential public services and a fundamental societal structure.)
    2.  "They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer." (This reiterates and intensifies the destructive intent and scope of the threat posed by the described adversaries.)
    3.  "in the midst of all of these addictions, the worst and most dangerous addiction we have is the greed of the oligarchs." (This frames the "greed of the oligarchs" as an active, pervasive, and "dangerous" force comparable to severe societal ills, instilling a sense of peril.)
*   **Score:** 0.7
*   **Confidence:** 0.9 (The language is clear and frequent in conveying an atmosphere of active threat and vulnerability.)

**2. Hope (0.0-1.0)**
*   **Analysis:** While the speech primarily details problems and threats, it concludes with a strong call to action that imbues the climate with hope. This hope is positioned as achievable through collective effort, promising a future where current injustices are overcome and a better society is created.
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "That is what a rigged economy is about, and that is what we are going to change." (This declarative statement, positioned after outlining grievances, signals a firm intention and belief in positive future transformation.)
    2.  "I don't have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know this, that 99% is a hell of a lot larger number than 1%." (This statement implicitly suggests the power of the collective to overcome obstacles, fostering optimism about potential for success.)
    3.  "So if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve." (This direct articulation of belief in victory and the creation of a desirable future explicitly instills a strong sense of hope and purpose.)
*   **Score:** 0.5
*   **Confidence:** 0.8 (Hope is clearly present and intentionally invoked, especially towards the speech's resolution, but it is not the dominant atmospheric tone throughout the entire text.)

**RELATIONAL CLIMATE DIMENSIONS:**

**3. Enmity (0.0-1.0)**
*   **Analysis:** The speech is saturated with an "us vs. them" narrative, explicitly framing a hostile conflict between "the American people" and "the oligarchs" (including associated figures like "Trump"). The language used to describe the latter group is consistently negative, accusatory, and dehumanizing, portraying them as a malevolent, destructive force.
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "We will not accept an oligarchic form of society. We will not accept the richest guy in the world running all over Washington... all so that they could give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1%." (This establishes a direct confrontation, positioning "the richest guy" and "wealthiest 1%" as adversaries imposing their will.)
    2.  "These guys, I want to tell you something because I bump into them in my line of work, they are not nice guys." (This direct character assassination labels the antagonists as inherently malicious, fostering a sense of personal animosity.)
    3.  "They are prepared to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Administration in order to make themselves even richer." (This attributes destructive, selfish, and ruthless intentions to the opposing group, intensifying the hostile emotional climate.)
*   **Score:** 0.9
*   **Confidence:** 1.0 (The entire discourse is built around a clear, pervasive, and intensely hostile portrayal of an adversarial group.)

**4. Amity (0.0-1.0)**
*   **Analysis:** Complementary to the strong sense of enmity towards the "oligarchs," the speech concurrently fosters a powerful sense of amity and unity among the targeted audience, "the American people" and "the 99%." This collective identity and shared purpose are presented as essential for overcoming the common adversary.
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "The American people are outraged at what's going on, and the American people are saying loud and clear, 'We will not accept an oligarchic form of society.'" (This establishes a collective "we," unified in sentiment and resolve against a common threat.)
    2.  "I don't care if you are a Republican, Democrat, or independent, I don't think there's anybody who thinks it vaguely makes sense..." (This appeals broadly to a sense of shared understanding and common ground across traditional divisions, fostering inclusive unity.)
    3.  "So if we stand together, are strong, are disciplined, are smart, I have every reason to believe deeply in my heart that not only will we defeat Trumpism, but we can create the kind of nation that we deserve." (This explicit call for collective action and solidarity ("stand together") underscores the importance of unity as the pathway to success.)
*   **Score:** 0.7
*   **Confidence:** 0.9 (The emphasis on collective identity and unified action is consistently present, serving as a crucial emotional counterpoint to the enmity.)

**SUCCESS ORIENTATION CLIMATE DIMENSIONS:**

**5. Envy (0.0-1.0)**
*   **Analysis:** The speech heavily relies on language that evokes resentment and grievance over perceived economic injustice and unfairness. It systematically highlights the immense wealth and power of a few at the expense of the many, using terms like "rigged economy" and "transfer of wealth" to fuel a sense of indignation.
*   **Quotations:**
    1.  "We will not accept the richest guy in the world running all over Washington... all so that they could give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1%." (This directly points to an unfair distribution of economic benefits, where the wealthy receive privileges at public expense.)
    2.  "Today you have more concentration of ownership in America than we have ever had... extraordinarily large corporations who charge us outrageous prices..." (This illustrates a system where power and wealth are unfairly concentrated, leading to exploitation and a sense of being taken advantage of.)
    3.  "Meanwhile, there has been a $75 trillion transfer of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. That is what a rigged economy is about..." (This explicitly labels the economic system as "rigged" and quantifies a massive, unjust transfer of wealth, directly fostering a climate of grievance and envy.)
*   **Score:** 0.9
*   **Confidence:** 1.0 (The entire foundational argument of the speech is built upon the pervasive sense of economic injustice and resentment.)

**6. Compersion (0.0-1.0)**
*   **Analysis:** This emotional dimension is virtually absent from the text. The speech focuses entirely on critiquing existing wealth and power dynamics as unjust and accumulated unfairly, rather than celebrating earned success, shared prosperity, or merit-based achievement.
*   **Quotations:** (No direct quotations supporting a climate of compersion are present in the text.)
*   **Score:** 0.0
*   **Confidence:** 1.0 (There is no language or thematic emphasis on celebrating success, shared abundance, or earned merit.)

**SALIENCE RANKING:**

1.  **Enmity:** The primary emotional driver. The identification of a clear, malevolent enemy ("oligarchs," "Trump," "richest 1%") against whom the struggle is defined is central to the entire discourse. This conflict provides the fundamental tension of the speech.
2.  **Envy:** The core justification for the enmity. The detailed grievances about economic inequality, the "rigged economy," and the perceived unfair accumulation of wealth underpin the entire critique and ignite the audience's resentment. It gives the enmity its moral and emotional weight.
3.  **Amity:** Crucially salient as the proposed *solution* and rallying point against the enmity and fear. The call for unity and collective action among "the American people" is presented as the only path to overcome the identified adversaries and injustices. It defines the 'us' in the 'us vs. them'.
4.  **Fear:** While not as constantly explicit as enmity or envy, the fear of losing essential services and the dire consequences of the "oligarchs'" actions serve as a powerful undercurrent, raising the stakes and compelling action. It amplifies the urgency of the situation.
5.  **Hope:** Present as the ultimate desired outcome and motivator for engagement, but it appears predominantly at the conclusion of the speech, serving as a promise rather than a pervasive emotional atmosphere throughout the problem articulation.
6.  **Compersion:** Completely absent, as the speech's focus is on critiquing current economic structures and the perceived unfairness of wealth concentration, not on celebrating achievement or shared prosperity.
