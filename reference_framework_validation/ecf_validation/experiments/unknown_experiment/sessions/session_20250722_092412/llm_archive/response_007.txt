    1.  "These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face."
    2.  "defend our security in a dangerous world"
    3.  "I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America."

**Ranking by Salience:**

1.  **Amity:** Most salient. The primary emotional driver and thematic core of the speech. It structures the address, from addressing supporters as "friends" to the overarching plea for national unity and cooperation with the new administration.
2.  **Hope:** Highly salient. Intertwined with Amity, it provides the forward-looking vision and purpose for the unity and national effort. It's the desired outcome of bridging differences and moving past the election.
3.  **Compersion:** Very salient. It directly contributes to the speech's widely praised "graciousness" by celebrating the opponent's achievement and the historical significance of the election, rather than dwelling on personal loss.
4.  **Fear:** Moderately salient. While not dominant, the acknowledgement of "difficult times" and a "dangerous world" provides a necessary context that makes the calls for unity and hope more urgent and relevant. It acts as a backdrop against which the positive emotions are highlighted.
5.  **Enmity:** Low salience. Its salience comes from its deliberate and active *rejection*. The speech explicitly counters any residual animosity from the campaign, emphasizing reconciliation.
6.  **Envy:** Very low salience. It is virtually absent from the emotional landscape, indicating a complete lack of resentment or grievance regarding the outcome.

**Overall Emotional Climate:**
The dominant emotional climate is one of profound **Amity** and **Hope**, infused with **Compersion** for the historic achievement of the opponent. While acknowledging external **Fear**-inducing challenges, these are consistently framed as catalysts for collective action rather than sources of despair. **Enmity** and **Envy** are actively and almost entirely absent, contributing to the speech's reputation for dignity and statesmanship. The atmosphere is overwhelmingly one of reconciliation, national unity, and a forward-looking belief in shared progress.
