The analysis focused on identifying and scoring nine core populist anchors, assessing their salience and confidence, and extracting supporting evidence. Due to the nature of the input text, some dimensions had lower raw scores and confidence as they were not explicitly or strongly present. The overall confidence reflects a thorough application of the framework to the provided text."
