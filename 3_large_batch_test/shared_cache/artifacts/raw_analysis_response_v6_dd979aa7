The document presents a strong alignment with several populist dimensions, particularly around the 'people vs. elite' framing, crisis rhetoric, and calls for popular sovereignty. The scores reflect the intensity and salience of these themes throughout the text. Evidence extraction prioritized direct quotes that clearly illustrate these dimensions."
