The speech demonstrates a clear distinction between 'the people' and 'elites/institutions' in economic terms (populist) but simultaneously advocates for institutional reform and bipartisan cooperation (pluralist). On the horizontal axis, it balances American exceptionalism and national interest (nationalism) with calls for civic duty, constitutional values, and global cooperation (patriotism)."
