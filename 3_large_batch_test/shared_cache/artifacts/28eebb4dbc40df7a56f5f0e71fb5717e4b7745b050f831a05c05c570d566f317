The analysis focuses on the interplay between populist and pluralist themes, and nationalist and patriotic sentiments. The speech frequently employs populist rhetoric to champion the 'many' against 'the few' and 'wealthy interests', while simultaneously advocating for pluralist principles like bipartisanship and institutional adherence. Patriotism is overwhelmingly civic, emphasizing shared values and duties, with economic nationalism and national security featuring as secondary themes.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"Obama_SOTU_2009.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"Populism-Pluralism Axis\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.65,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"Nationalism-Patriotism Axis\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.25,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Populism-Pluralism Axis\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"It is our unfinished task to make sure that this Government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"Core Populist Appeal\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Populism-Pluralism Axis\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"context_type\": \"Anti-Elite Sentiment; Economic Populism\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Nationalism-Patriotism Axis\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"As Americans, we all share the same proud title: We are citizens.
