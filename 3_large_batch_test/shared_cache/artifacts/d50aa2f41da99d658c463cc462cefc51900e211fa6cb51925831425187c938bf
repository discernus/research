    "analysis_notes": "The speech demonstrates a nuanced interplay between populist and pluralist themes, particularly in its economic messaging. While emphasizing 'the people's money' and 'government overcharge' in a populist vein, it consistently frames solutions within institutional reform and calls for bipartisan cooperation. Similarly, strong nationalistic claims of American exceptionalism and global leadership are balanced by appeals to civic duty, universal rights, and the importance of democratic institutions, reflecting a strong civic patriotism."
