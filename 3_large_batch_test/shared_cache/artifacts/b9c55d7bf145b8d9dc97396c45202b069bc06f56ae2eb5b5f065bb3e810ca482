    "analysis_notes": "Analyzed a State of the Union address, which despite the filename 'Obama_SOTU_2009.txt', contains content referencing events and policies from 2011 onwards, suggesting it is a later SOTU speech (likely 2013 or 2014). The analysis focuses on the interplay between populist and pluralist themes, and nationalist and patriotic sentiments. The speech frequently employs populist rhetoric to champion the 'many' against 'the few' and 'wealthy interests', while simultaneously advocating for pluralist principles like bipartisanship and institutional adherence. Patriotism is overwhelmingly civic, emphasizing shared values and duties, with economic nationalism and national security featuring as secondary themes."
