    "analysis_notes": "Analysis conducted using the PDAF v7.1 framework. Document 1 (Republican_Platform_2008.pdf) shows a strong adherence to core populist themes, particularly in framing the 'people' versus the 'elite' and emphasizing popular sovereignty. Mechanistic anchors related to 'elite conspiracy' and 'systemic corruption' are present, though less pronounced than core themes. Boundary distinctions are subtle, with minimal explicit 'anti-pluralist exclusion' or 'nationalist exclusion' evident, and economic appeals are more implicit than explicit."
