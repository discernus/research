The speech exhibits strong populist tendencies by framing issues as 'the people' vs. 'elites' and emphasizing direct appeals to the populace. There are moderate indicators of nationalistic sentiment, focusing on American exceptionalism and strength. Pluralist elements are present in calls for bipartisanship and working across aisles, but they are framed within a larger populist narrative."
