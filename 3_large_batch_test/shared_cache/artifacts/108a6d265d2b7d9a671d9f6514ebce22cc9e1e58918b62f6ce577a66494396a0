She's never collected unemployment benefits, but she's been paying taxes. In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home. A week later, the budget cuts claimed the job she loved. Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter, the kind I get every day. 'We are the face of the unemployment crisis,' she wrote. 'I'm not dependent on the government. Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society, care about our neighbors. I'm confident that in time, I will find a job, I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love. Please give us this chance.'",
