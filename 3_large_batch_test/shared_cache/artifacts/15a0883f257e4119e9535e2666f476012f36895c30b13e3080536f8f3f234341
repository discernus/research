    "analysis_notes": "Analyzed George W. Bush's 2002 State of the Union Address for populist-pluralist and nationalist-patriotic discourse. The speech, delivered post-9/11, exhibits a strong emphasis on civic patriotism and institutional reform, with some populist appeals related to economic and social issues, but largely within existing institutional frameworks. Nationalism is present in terms of American leadership and strength, but strongly tempered by universal ideals and a rejection of imposed governance."
