    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on President Biden's 2021 State of the Union address, evaluating its discourse along the Populism-Pluralism and Nationalism-Patriotism axes. The speech demonstrates a blend of economically populist appeals, focusing on 'the people' against 'the wealthy,' alongside strong civic patriotic themes and calls for institutional cooperation. Nationalism is present in a competitive, 'America is back' sense, rather than an ethnic or exclusionary one."
