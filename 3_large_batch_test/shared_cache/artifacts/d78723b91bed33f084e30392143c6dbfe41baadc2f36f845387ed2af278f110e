    "analysis_notes": "The speech exhibits a blend of populist and pluralist rhetoric domestically, with a stronger lean towards nationalism in its foreign policy and national security framing. The 'us vs. them' narrative is predominantly applied to external threats (terrorism, hostile regimes) rather than internal elites, though anti-establishment sentiments regarding government inefficiency and special interests are present. Calls for bipartisanship and adherence to constitutional principles are notable."
