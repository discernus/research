    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on identifying populist and patriotic rhetorical elements in President Obama's 2015 State of the Union address. The speech exhibits a blend of anti-elite populist critique aimed at 'Wall Street' and 'Washington insiders,' combined with a strong, inclusive civic patriotism that champions American ideals and institutions. The populist rhetoric serves to diagnose systemic issues and mobilize 'the people' for reform, rather than advocating for a radical overthrow of institutions."
