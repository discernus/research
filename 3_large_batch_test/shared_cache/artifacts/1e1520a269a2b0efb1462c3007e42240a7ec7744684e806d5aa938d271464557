    "analysis_notes": "Analysis based on the provided framework, focusing on populist and nationalist discourse markers. The document shows strong populist leanings with direct appeals to 'the people' and anti-elite sentiment. Nationalist markers are also present, emphasizing American exceptionalism and cultural heritage. There's a blend of both, suggesting a complex rhetorical strategy. Confidence is high due to clear presence of key phrases."
