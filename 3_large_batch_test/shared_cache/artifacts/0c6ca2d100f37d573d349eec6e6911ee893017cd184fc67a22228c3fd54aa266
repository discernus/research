Focus was on identifying and scoring populist-pluralist and nationalist-patriotist dimensions, along with their salience and confidence. Evidence extraction prioritized direct quotes supporting the dimensional scores. Document analysis indicates a moderate to high presence of populist rhetoric and a moderate presence of nationalist sentiment, with evidence for direct appeals to 'the people' and claims of 'American greatness'."
