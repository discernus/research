The report for document 1 (Clinton_SOTU_2001.txt) indicates a mixed but generally low score on the populism-pluralism axis and a moderate to high score on the nationalism-patriotism axis. The language used often appeals to 'the people' and contrasts them with 'elites' or 'the establishment,' but also emphasizes shared American values and identity. Evidence extraction focused on identifying specific phrases and keywords as defined in the framework.
