The framework was applied to identify and score nine core dimensions of populist discourse, focusing on explicit textual evidence and assessing salience and confidence for each dimension. The extended 0.0-2.0 scale was utilized where appropriate for high-intensity populist rhetoric. The analysis followed a sequential step-by-step approach as outlined in the framework."
