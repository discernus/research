The analysis focused on identifying populist tendencies related to anti-elite sentiment and direct popular sovereignty, and nationalist tendencies related to ethnic/cultural identity versus civic patriotism. The document exhibits a moderate populist leaning due to its 'people vs. Republican establishment' framing and a strong civic patriotic stance, rather than an exclusionary nationalist one."
