The speech consistently emphasizes collaboration, strengthening democratic institutions, and inclusive national identity, rather than an anti-elite or ethno-nationalist stance. Rhetorical prominence is given to unity, shared responsibility, and America's global role as a beacon of democracy and diversity."
