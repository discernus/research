Emphasis placed on identifying nuanced semantic expressions rather than literal keyword matching. Confidence is high due to clear populist rhetoric and consistent thematic alignment with the framework's dimensions."

And for too many families, the dream of homeownership is out of reach. As working people struggle, the top one percent accrues more wealth and more power. Republicans in Congress have chosen gridlock and dysfunction over trying to find solutions to the real challenges we face. It's no wonder that so many feel like the deck is stacked against them.",
