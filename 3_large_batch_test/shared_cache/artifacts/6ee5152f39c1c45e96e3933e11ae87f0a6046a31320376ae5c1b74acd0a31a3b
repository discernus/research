    "analysis_notes": "Analysis conducted using the v7.1 framework, focusing on the two-axis model of populism-pluralism and nationalism-patriotism. Emphasis was placed on identifying core populist and nationalist rhetoric, including appeals to 'the people' versus 'elites' and claims of national superiority, while also noting evidence of pluralistic or patriotic counter-themes. Confidence is high due to clear alignment of text segments with framework definitions."
