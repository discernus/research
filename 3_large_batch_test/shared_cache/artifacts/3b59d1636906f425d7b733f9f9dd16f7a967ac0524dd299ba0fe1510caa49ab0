    "analysis_notes": "Analysis focuses on how the speech balances appeals to 'the people' with a strong emphasis on institutional reform, bipartisan cooperation, and a civic, inclusive national identity. The vertical axis score reflects a moderate populist lean due to explicit critiques of political dysfunction and economic inequality, while solutions remain largely pluralist. The horizontal axis score shows a strong emphasis on civic patriotism, with national pride rooted in ideals and opportunity rather than exclusionary identity."
