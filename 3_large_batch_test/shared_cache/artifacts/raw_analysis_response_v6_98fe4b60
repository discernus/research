    "analysis_notes": "Analysis conducted using the PDFA v7.1 framework. The document strongly advocates for a significant shift in governance and economic policy, aligning with populist rhetoric by emphasizing the \"people\" versus \"elites\" and calling for a \"revolution\" to restore perceived lost greatness. The language is highly charged and uses strong emotional appeals. Some dimensions were difficult to score due to the programmatic nature of the text, which often involves broad policy statements rather than specific actions."
