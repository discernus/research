## 1. Executive Summary

This report details a computational analysis of populist discourse in six presidential speeches from 2017 to 2025, utilizing the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0. The analysis reveals that the studied rhetoric is characterized by consistently high levels of populism across multiple dimensions, particularly **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** (M = 0.88), **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** (M = 0.94), and **Economic Populist Appeals** (M = 0.91). These findings suggest a discursive style deeply rooted in a moral conflict between the "people" and a corrupt "elite," set against a backdrop of national crisis and economic grievance.

The most significant insight from this study is the identification of strategic trade-offs within populist messaging. The data reveals strong negative correlations between key populist themes, indicating that they are not deployed uniformly. Notably, a strong emphasis on a **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** is inversely related to rhetoric focusing on **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption** (r = -0.79), suggesting speakers choose between a temporal narrative of decline and redemption or a causal narrative of elite malfeasance. Similarly, a strong negative correlation exists between **Economic Populist Appeals** and **Homogeneous People Construction** (r = -0.73), implying a rhetorical tension between highlighting economic divisions and fostering a sense of national unity.

The framework's novel **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** proved effective in quantifying the coherence of populist messaging. The analysis found that the 2017 Inaugural Address, representing foundational rhetoric, exhibited the highest level of populism and the greatest strategic contradiction (PSCI = 0.18). This suggests that the most intense populist appeals may also be the most rhetorically inconsistent. The strong positive correlation between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and the PSCI (r = 0.95) further indicates that as the core "us vs. them" populist message intensifies, so does the level of strategic contradiction within the discourse. While limited by a small sample size, these preliminary findings demonstrate the PDAF's capacity to move beyond simple detection of populism to analyze its complex internal structure and strategic deployment.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Populist Rhetoric is Pervasive and Intense:** The analysis shows consistently high mean scores across core populist dimensions, including **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** (M = 0.88), **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** (M = 0.94), and **Economic Populist Appeals** (M = 0.91), indicating these themes are central and dominant features of the analyzed discourse.
*   **A Key Rhetorical Trade-off Exists Between Crisis and Conspiracy:** A strong negative correlation (r = -0.79) between **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** and **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption** suggests a strategic choice. Speakers tend to emphasize either a narrative of national decline requiring restoration or a narrative of a system rigged by corrupt elites, but not both with equal intensity in the same speech.
*   **Economic Grievance and National Unity are in Tension:** The analysis revealed a strong negative correlation (r = -0.73) between **Economic Populist Appeals** and **Homogeneous People Construction**. This suggests a rhetorical trade-off: emphasizing economic grievances that divide the populace along class lines may come at the expense of constructing a unified, homogeneous "people."
*   **Boundary-Drawing is a Core Strategy:** A strong positive correlation (r = 0.86) between **Nationalist Exclusion** and **Economic Populist Appeals** indicates that defining the "people" against external threats is closely linked to framing economic problems as betrayals by elites who favor foreign interests.
*   **Intense Populism Correlates with Strategic Contradiction:** The **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** is strongly and positively correlated with **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** (r = 0.95). This suggests that as the fundamental populist antagonism intensifies, the overall message becomes more strategically incoherent, deploying contradictory appeals simultaneously.
*   **Foundational Rhetoric is the Most Populist and Contradictory:** The 2017 Inaugural Address registered the highest **Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index** (0.88) and the highest **PSCI** (0.18), indicating that the initial, tone-setting speech was both the most intensely populist and the most rhetorically contradictory of the speeches analyzed.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description

This analysis employed the **Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0**, a multi-dimensional tool designed to quantify the components of populist political communication. The PDAF moves beyond binary classification (populist/non-populist) to measure the intensity and rhetorical salience of populist appeals across nine core dimensions, organized into three theoretical categories:

1.  **Primary Populist Core Anchors**: The foundational elements of populist ideology, including **Manichaean People-Elite Framing**, **Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative**, **Popular Sovereignty Claims**, and **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion**.
2.  **Populist Mechanism Anchors**: The rhetorical strategies used to mobilize support, including **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**, **Authenticity vs. Political Class**, and **Homogeneous People Construction**.
3.  **Boundary Distinction Anchors**: The methods used to define the populist in-group and out-group, including **Nationalist Exclusion** and **Economic Populist Appeals**.

A key innovation of the PDAF is its use of **salience-weighted analysis**, which captures not only the intensity of a given theme (raw score, 0.0-1.0) but also its prominence and centrality to the overall message (salience, 0.0-1.0). Furthermore, the framework introduces **Populist Strategic Tension Mathematics** to quantify contradictory messaging. This is aggregated into the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**, an overall measure of a text's rhetorical coherence. A high PSCI indicates that a speaker is simultaneously deploying high-intensity populist appeals that are in theoretical tension with one another.

### Data and Corpus

The corpus consists of six formal presidential speeches delivered by Donald J. Trump between 2017 and 2025. The documents were selected to represent different contexts and time periods to enable preliminary temporal analysis:

*   **Early Period (2017)**: Inaugural Address, Joint Session Address
*   **Mid Period (2018-2020)**: State of the Union Addresses for 2018, 2019, and 2020
*   **Recent Period (2025)**: State of the Union Address for 2025

Each speech was analyzed using the PDAF, generating scores for all nine dimensions and the derived metrics.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations

The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational, focusing on interpreting means, standard deviations, and the Pearson correlation matrix of the PDAF dimensions and indices. All statistical values are reported with a precision of two to three decimal places, following APA 7th edition guidelines.

A significant limitation of this study is the small sample size (N=6). This prevents robust inferential statistical analysis, such as the planned ANOVA tests for temporal and contextual effects, which were automatically skipped due to insufficient data points per group. Therefore, all conclusions regarding temporal trends or differences between speech types (e.g., Inaugural vs. State of the Union) should be considered preliminary and suggestive, not statistically validated. The findings primarily serve to demonstrate the analytical potential of the PDAF and to generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The analysis reveals a discourse consistently characterized by high levels of populism. As shown in Table 1, the mean raw scores for most dimensions are exceptionally high, indicating that these populist themes are not merely present but are intense and central features of the rhetoric.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key Populist Dimensions and Indices**

| Dimension / Index                               | Mean | Std. Dev. | Min  | Max  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---- | --------- | ---- | ---- |
| Manichaean People-Elite Framing                 | 0.88 | 0.05      | 0.80 | 0.95 |
| Crisis-Restoration Narrative                    | 0.94 | 0.04      | 0.90 | 1.00 |
| Economic Populist Appeals                       | 0.91 | 0.05      | 0.85 | 1.00 |
| Nationalist Exclusion                           | 0.88 | 0.08      | 0.80 | 1.00 |
| Homogeneous People Construction                 | 0.81 | 0.13      | 0.60 | 0.90 |
| Popular Sovereignty Claims                      | 0.78 | 0.13      | 0.60 | 1.00 |
| Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption            | 0.77 | 0.08      | 0.70 | 0.90 |
| Anti-Pluralist Exclusion                        | 0.70 | 0.15      | 0.40 | 0.80 |
| Authenticity vs. Political Class                | 0.69 | 0.08      | 0.60 | 0.80 |
| **Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index**    | 0.85 | 0.03      | 0.81 | 0.88 |
| **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** | 0.11 | 0.05      | 0.05 | 0.18 |

The highest-scoring dimensions are **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** (M = 0.94) and **Economic Populist Appeals** (M = 0.91), suggesting the rhetoric is built upon a foundation of perceived national emergency and economic grievance. This is supported by statements like, "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt), which establishes a severe crisis, and "The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt), which frames economic hardship as a deliberate act of betrayal.

The core populist dimension, **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** (M = 0.88), is also extremely high, confirming the centrality of an "us vs. them" worldview. This is evident in claims that "The corrupt political establishment has betrayed the American people" (Source: trump_sotu_2017.txt). Dimensions related to authenticity and anti-pluralism, while still present, received comparatively lower scores, suggesting they are secondary to the core messages of crisis, economic betrayal, and elite corruption.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Strategic Contradiction

The **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**, which measures the degree of contradictory messaging, provides one of the most novel insights. The mean PSCI across the speeches was 0.11, but with notable variation. The 2017 Inaugural Address yielded the highest PSCI score (0.18), indicating it was the most rhetorically contradictory speech. In contrast, the subsequent State of the Union addresses exhibited lower contradiction scores (Mean SOTU PSCI = 0.096).

This suggests that the foundational, tone-setting rhetoric of the presidency was characterized by a "kitchen sink" approach, throwing multiple, sometimes conflicting, populist appeals at the audience. For instance, the Inaugural Address scored maximally on **Popular Sovereignty Claims** (raw score: 1.0, salience: 1.0) with statements like, "we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt). However, it also contained elements of **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion** (raw score: 0.4, salience: 0.3), such as, "We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt). The high score on the first dimension combined with the presence of the second, but at a much lower salience, created significant `democratic_authoritarian_tension` (0.28), driving the overall PSCI score up. This pattern suggests that foundational populist speeches may prioritize intensity over coherence.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix reveals a complex internal structure within the populist discourse, defined by both synergistic relationships and strategic trade-offs.

#### Synergistic Relationships

Several dimensions are strongly and positively correlated, suggesting they form consistent rhetorical pairings.
*   **Manichaean Framing and Popular Sovereignty (r = 0.87):** The moral dichotomy between the "people" and the "elite" is strongly linked to claims that the people's will is the ultimate source of authority. This pairing creates a powerful narrative where the corrupt elite is positioned as an obstacle to true democracy. As the speaker stated, "the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first" (Source: trump_sotu_2017.txt), directly linking the unified people to a sovereign demand.
*   **Nationalist Exclusion and Economic Populism (r = 0.86):** The data shows a powerful link between defining the nation's boundaries against external threats and framing economic grievances. This synergy constructs a narrative where economic hardship is caused by foreign actors and enabled by a domestic elite that fails to protect the nation. This is perfectly encapsulated in the statement: "We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt).

#### Strategic Trade-offs

The most striking findings are the strong negative correlations, which suggest that emphasizing one populist theme may come at the expense of another.
*   **Crisis-Restoration vs. Elite Conspiracy (r = -0.79):** This is the strongest negative correlation in the dataset. It indicates that speeches tend to focus on either a temporal narrative of decline and promised restoration *or* a causal narrative of elite conspiracy, but rarely both with high intensity. For example, the 2018 SOTU was high on **Crisis-Restoration** (raw score: 1.0), with claims like "A new chapter of American greatness is now beginning" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2018.txt), but lower on **Elite Conspiracy** (raw score: 0.7). Conversely, other speeches that emphasize conspiracy, such as draining "the swamp of government corruption" (Source: trump_sotu_2017.txt), tend to have a less pronounced crisis-restoration arc. This suggests a strategic choice between two different ways of explaining societal problems.
*   **Economic Populism vs. Homogeneous People (r = -0.73):** This negative correlation points to a fundamental tension in populist strategy. Emphasizing economic grievances, which often highlights divisions within "the people" (e.g., working class vs. financial elite), appears to be rhetorically incompatible with constructing an image of a perfectly unified, homogeneous nation. A speech might focus on how "The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt), an economic populist appeal, or it might emphasize that "We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2018.txt), a homogeneous construction. The data suggests it is difficult to do both with high intensity simultaneously.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlational structure provides significant insights into the nature of the populist rhetoric under examination. The strong positive correlation between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index** (r = 0.95) is a critical finding. It suggests that strategic contradiction is not a bug but a feature of intensely populist discourse. As the core message of "us vs. them" becomes more pronounced, the speaker is more likely to deploy a wider, less coherent range of supporting appeals. This challenges the notion of populism as a simple or "thin" ideology, suggesting instead that its application can be complex and internally fraught.

The Inaugural Address serves as a clear archetype of this phenomenon. It scored highest on overall populism (SWOPI = 0.88) and highest on contradiction (PSCI = 0.18). It set a foundational tone of intense, Manichaean conflict, as seen in the declaration: "For too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt). This foundational speech's high contradiction score suggests that at the outset of a populist project, the goal may be to maximize rhetorical firepower, even at the cost of coherence. The subsequent SOTU speeches, while still highly populist, show a lower average PSCI, suggesting a potential shift toward a more consolidated and strategically refined message over time.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) demonstrated considerable effectiveness in this analysis. Its multi-dimensional structure allowed for a nuanced view of the corpus, moving beyond a simple "populist" label. The framework's dimensions showed good discriminatory power; the strong positive and negative correlations suggest that the anchors are measuring related but distinct constructs, lending support to the framework's construct validity.

The introduction of **salience** and the **PSCI** proved to be the most valuable innovations. Salience-weighting allowed the overall populism index to reflect the speaker's strategic emphasis, while the PSCI uncovered the critical pattern of strategic contradiction that would be invisible to a simple analysis of raw scores. The ability to identify rhetorical trade-offs (e.g., Crisis vs. Conspiracy) is a significant methodological advance that enables a more sophisticated understanding of how populist arguments are constructed. The framework-corpus fit was excellent, as the high scores and distinct patterns indicate the PDAF is well-suited to analyzing this type of political speech.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis have several important theoretical implications for the study of populism. The discovery of systematic rhetorical trade-offs challenges the view of populism as a simple, "thin-centered ideology" that can be attached to any "thick" ideology. Instead, this analysis suggests that populism itself has an internal grammar and a set of strategic constraints. The choice between a **Crisis-Restoration** narrative and an **Elite Conspiracy** narrative, for example, may represent a fundamental fork in populist strategy—one focusing on temporal redemption and the other on systemic corruption. Future research could explore whether these two paths lead to different political outcomes or appeal to different segments of the electorate.

Furthermore, the strong positive correlation between the core populist message and strategic contradiction (PSCI) is a crucial insight. It suggests that as populism becomes more extreme, it may also become more incoherent. This could be a strategic weakness, opening the speaker to charges of hypocrisy, or it could be a strategic strength, allowing the speaker to appeal to disparate audiences with conflicting messages simultaneously. The higher contradiction in the Inaugural Address compared to later SOTU speeches suggests a possible "rhetorical lifecycle" for a populist leader: an initial, contradictory, and intense phase to build a coalition, followed by a more coherent phase of governance and message consolidation.

This study's primary limitation remains its small sample size. The patterns identified here are strong and theoretically compelling, but they must be validated on a much larger and more diverse corpus of texts, including speeches from different political actors, countries, and ideological positions. Future studies should aim to replicate this analysis with a larger N to confirm whether these strategic trade-offs and the relationship between intensity and contradiction are universal features of populist discourse or specific to this particular speaker and context.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of presidential rhetoric through the lens of the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0 has yielded significant preliminary insights into the structure and strategy of populist communication. The study confirmed that the analyzed speeches are intensely populist, built on a core of Manichaean conflict, crisis narratives, and economic grievances.

More importantly, this analysis moved beyond measuring intensity to uncover the strategic architecture of this discourse. The findings reveal a system of rhetorical trade-offs, where an emphasis on certain populist themes appears to preclude an emphasis on others. The novel metrics of the PDAF, particularly the Populist Strategic Contradiction Index, proved highly effective, revealing that the most intensely populist messages may also be the most strategically contradictory. While these findings are based on a limited sample and require further validation, they powerfully demonstrate the value of computational methods in advancing the study of political communication, offering a path toward a more nuanced, data-driven understanding of one of the most significant political phenomena of our time.

*   "For too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land."

Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.
