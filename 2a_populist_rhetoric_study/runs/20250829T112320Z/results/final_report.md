## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of populist discourse in a corpus of six U.S. presidential speeches delivered between 2017 and 2025. Utilizing the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0, this study quantifies the intensity and rhetorical salience of nine distinct populist dimensions. The analysis reveals a highly consistent and structurally coherent populist rhetorical style across the examined texts. Key findings indicate that the discourse is dominated by a **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** (Mean Score, *M* = 0.91) and **Nationalist Exclusion** (*M* = 0.89), which serve as foundational pillars.

Statistical analysis reveals a powerful "populist syndrome," where core dimensions are tightly interwoven. Specifically, **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** demonstrates an exceptionally strong positive correlation with **Economic Populist Appeals** (*r* = 0.97), suggesting that moral dichotomies are almost invariably articulated through the lens of economic grievance. Similarly, strong correlations exist between this Manichaean framing and claims of **Authenticity vs. The Political Class** (*r* = 0.85) and the **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** (*r* = 0.83). This suggests a rhetorical strategy where a virtuous "people" are positioned against a corrupt elite that has precipitated a national crisis, a crisis only an authentic outsider can resolve.

The framework's novel **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** and its component tension metrics remained consistently low, indicating a rhetorically sophisticated deployment of populist themes that avoids overt contradictions. For instance, the low **Democratic-Authoritarian Tension** (*M* = 0.09) suggests that claims to popular will and anti-pluralist statements are carefully balanced in their salience to maintain a coherent message. While the small sample size (*N*=6) precludes definitive conclusions about temporal or contextual trends, this descriptive analysis provides a detailed portrait of a potent and internally consistent populist rhetorical structure, generating clear, testable hypotheses for future large-scale research.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **A "Populist Syndrome" Defines the Rhetorical Style:** The analysis reveals that populist dimensions do not operate in isolation but form a tightly correlated cluster. **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** acts as a central hub, strongly predicting the presence of **Economic Populist Appeals** (*r* = 0.97), **Authenticity Claims** (*r* = 0.85), and **Crisis-Restoration Narratives** (*r* = 0.83). This indicates a unified rhetorical package rather than a menu of optional appeals.
*   **Crisis and Exclusion are the Dominant Themes:** Across all speeches, the **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** (*M* = 0.91) and **Nationalist Exclusion** (*M* = 0.89) were the most consistently high-scoring dimensions. This suggests the core rhetorical strategy hinges on framing the present as a moment of profound national peril caused by external threats, requiring a dramatic restoration of a past ideal.
*   **Economic Grievance is the Primary Vehicle for People-Elite Conflict:** The near-perfect correlation between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and **Economic Populist Appeals** (*r* = 0.97) is the most significant statistical finding. It suggests that the abstract moral conflict between "the people" and "the elite" is almost always grounded in tangible narratives of economic betrayal, as when the speaker claims, "The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt).
*   **Rhetoric is Strategically Coherent, Avoiding Overt Contradiction:** The framework's novel tension metrics, designed to detect contradictory messaging, were consistently low. For example, **Democratic-Authoritarian Tension** (*M* = 0.09) was minimal, suggesting that speakers skillfully balance the salience of appeals to popular sovereignty with anti-pluralist statements to avoid undermining their message. This points to a sophisticated, rather than clumsy, application of populist rhetoric.
*   **Anti-Pluralism and Authenticity Claims Show High Variability:** While core populist themes were consistently high, **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion** (*SD* = 0.35) and **Authenticity vs. Political Class** (*SD* = 0.29) showed the greatest variance. This suggests these dimensions are deployed more tactically, perhaps moderated by the formality of the speech context (e.g., a State of the Union address vs. an inaugural speech).
*   **Study Limitations Prevent Temporal Analysis:** The experimental design, with only one or two documents in each temporal or contextual group, meant that planned statistical tests (ANOVA) for changes over time or across speech types could not be performed. The findings are therefore descriptive and preliminary, highlighting stable patterns within this corpus but not their evolution.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description

This study employed the **Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0**, a computational tool designed for the systematic measurement of populist political communication. The PDAF moves beyond simple binary classification (populist/non-populist) to provide a granular, quantitative assessment across nine core dimensions, organized into three theoretical categories:

1.  **Primary Populist Core Anchors:** The foundational elements of populist ideology, including *Manichaean People-Elite Framing*, *Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative*, *Popular Sovereignty Claims*, and *Anti-Pluralist Exclusion*.
2.  **Populist Mechanism Anchors:** The rhetorical strategies used to mobilize support, including *Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption*, *Authenticity vs. Political Class*, and *Homogeneous People Construction*.
3.  **Boundary Distinction Anchors:** The methods used to define the populist "in-group" and "out-group," including *Nationalist Exclusion* and *Economic Populist Appeals*.

A key innovation of the PDAF is its use of **salience-weighted analysis**, which measures not only the intensity (raw score, 0.0-1.0) of a populist appeal but also its rhetorical prominence (salience, 0.0-1.0) within a text. This enables the calculation of advanced derived metrics, most notably the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**, which quantifies the degree of internal contradiction in a speaker's message by analyzing the tension between theoretically opposed populist appeals.

### Corpus and Data Structure

The corpus consists of six formal presidential speeches delivered by Donald J. Trump between 2017 and 2025. The documents include one inaugural address, one joint session address, and four State of the Union addresses (one of which is hypothetical, dated 2025). This temporal design was intended to facilitate analysis of rhetorical evolution, though the small sample size ultimately limited this aspect of the study. Each document was analyzed using the PDAF, generating nine raw scores and nine salience scores, from which a suite of derived metrics (e.g., PSCI, salience-weighted indices) was calculated.

### Statistical Methods and Limitations

The analysis was primarily descriptive and correlational, appropriate for the exploratory nature of the study and the small sample size (*N*=6). The primary statistical methods included:

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of means, standard deviations, and ranges for all nine raw populist dimensions and all derived metrics to identify central tendencies and variability.
*   **Pearson Correlation Analysis:** A correlation matrix was computed to examine the relationships between all populist dimensions and key derived metrics. This was used to identify "anchor relationship patterns" and test the internal structure of the populist rhetoric.

A significant limitation of this study is the small corpus size. This prevented the execution of planned inferential statistical tests (One-Way ANOVA) to assess the significance of populist discourse variation across different time periods (Early, Mid, Recent) and speech contexts (Inaugural, Joint Session, State of the Union), as groups contained too few documents for valid comparison. Therefore, all findings should be considered preliminary and descriptive of this specific corpus, serving to generate hypotheses for future, larger-scale research.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

Analysis of the mean scores across the six speeches reveals a distinct hierarchy of populist themes. The rhetoric is most consistently characterized by a **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** and **Nationalist Exclusion**. In contrast, dimensions requiring direct attacks on the legitimacy of political opponents (*Anti-Pluralist Exclusion*) or claims of personal authenticity (*Authenticity vs. Political Class*) were used more moderately and showed the highest variability, suggesting they are more context-dependent rhetorical tools.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics of Populist Discourse Dimensions (Raw Scores, *N*=6)**

| Dimension                                | M    | SD   | Min  | Max  |

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Strategic Coherence

The PDAF's derived metrics provide insight into the strategic construction of the populist message. The **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**, which measures the degree of contradictory messaging, was consistently low across the corpus. The component tension scores reveal a sophisticated balancing of themes:

*   **Democratic-Authoritarian Tension (*M* = 0.09):** This metric captures the conflict between invoking the "people's will" (*Popular Sovereignty*) and rejecting legitimate opposition (*Anti-Pluralist Exclusion*). The very low score indicates that when both themes are present, their salience is carefully managed to avoid an overt contradiction. For example, in the 2019 SOTU, *Anti-Pluralist Exclusion* scored 0.0, completely removing any potential tension with the speech's claims to represent the popular will.
*   **Crisis-Elite Attribution Tension (*M* = 0.19):** This measures the tension between framing a national crisis and attributing it to elite conspiracy. The low score suggests these two narratives are presented cohesively, with similar rhetorical emphasis. The speaker consistently presents the crisis *as a direct result of* elite action or inaction, as seen in the 2025 SOTU: "as you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2025.txt). This creates a unified narrative rather than a contradictory one.

Overall, the low tension scores suggest that the populist appeals are not deployed haphazardly but are part of a strategically coherent and internally consistent rhetorical system.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix reveals a tightly integrated structure of populist rhetoric, what might be termed a "populist syndrome." At the center of this structure is **Manichaean People-Elite Framing**, which acts as a master narrative that activates and organizes other populist themes.

The strongest and most revealing correlations include:

*   **Manichaean Framing and Economic Appeals (*r* = 0.97):** This near-perfect positive correlation is the most significant finding. It indicates that the moral struggle between the "pure people" and the "corrupt elite" is almost invariably expressed through economic terms. The abstract enemy is made concrete as an "economic elite" responsible for the people's suffering. As Donald J. Trump stated in his 2020 SOTU, this link is explicit: "No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2020.txt). This quote perfectly fuses the people (working class) versus the elite (wealthy politicians/donors) with an economic dimension (competition for jobs).

*   **Manichaean Framing and Authenticity Claims (*r* = 0.85):** The speaker's positioning as an authentic outsider is strongly linked to the denunciation of a corrupt political class. This creates a powerful narrative solution: if the problem is a corrupt establishment, the solution must be a genuine outsider who is "not a politician." This is exemplified in the 2017 Inaugural Address: "We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt).

*   **Nationalist and Anti-Pluralist Exclusion (*r* = 0.81):** This strong positive correlation suggests a link between defining the "people" against external threats and delegitimizing internal opposition. The rhetoric that frames outsiders as a danger to the nation often co-occurs with rhetoric that frames internal political opponents as illegitimate. In the 2025 SOTU, the speaker delegitimizes the opposition by stating, "I could find a cure to the most devastating disease... and these people sitting right here will not clap," immediately after having framed the nation as under "invasion" at the border (Source: Trump_SOTU_2025.txt). This links the external threat to the alleged perfidy of the internal opposition.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns confirm the core tenets of the ideational approach to populism, which posits a "thin-centered ideology" built on the people-elite antagonism. This analysis demonstrates that this "thin" ideology is fleshed out with a consistent set of supporting themes: crisis, nationalism, economic grievance, and claims to authenticity.

The framework's construct validity is supported by these strong, theoretically-consistent correlations. The fact that *Manichaean People-Elite Framing* correlates so strongly with other core populist dimensions validates it as the central organizing principle of this rhetorical style. The data suggests a powerful narrative arc is consistently employed:
1.  **The Betrayal:** A corrupt, self-serving elite has betrayed the virtuous people, primarily through economic policies that have harmed the middle class.
2.  **The Crisis:** This betrayal has led to a state of "American carnage" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt), a national crisis that threatens the nation's very existence.
3.  **The Enemy:** The nation is besieged by external threats (e.g., on the border) and undermined from within by a political class that refuses to act.
4.  **The Solution:** A strong, authentic leader, embodying the direct will of the people, is required to bypass the failed institutions, restore the nation, and "make America great again."

This narrative is powerfully articulated in the 2017 Joint Session Address, where the speaker frames the election as a moment when "the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest... Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions" (Source: trump_sotu_2017.txt). This quote encapsulates the claim to popular sovereignty as a direct response to perceived elite failure.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The PDAF v10.0.0 proved highly effective in dissecting the structure of populist rhetoric within this corpus. Its multi-dimensional approach allowed for a granular analysis that moved beyond a simple "populist" label. The framework's primary strengths, as demonstrated in this analysis, are:

*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully distinguished between different facets of populism, revealing a clear hierarchy of themes (e.g., Crisis Narrative being more dominant than Anti-Pluralism). The high variance in some dimensions versus the low variance in others indicates the framework is sensitive to rhetorical nuance.
*   **Construct Validity:** The strong correlations between theoretically-linked dimensions (e.g., Manichaean Framing and Economic Populism) support the framework's theoretical grounding and construct validity.
*   **Innovative Metrics:** The strategic tension metrics provided a novel and valuable insight, demonstrating that the absence of contradiction can be as analytically significant as its presence. It revealed a sophisticated, rather than clumsy, rhetorical strategy.

The primary limitation in this application was not the framework itself, but the small size of the corpus, which prevented the full suite of statistical analyses from being conducted. The framework appears well-suited for larger-scale analysis where its capacity to detect temporal and contextual shifts could be fully leveraged.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis suggest that the populist discourse examined is not an ad-hoc collection of grievances but a systematic and internally coherent rhetorical system. The concept of a "populist syndrome," where a central Manichaean narrative organizes a constellation of supporting themes like crisis, nationalism, and economic grievance, emerges as a key theoretical implication. This provides a potential model for understanding how populist rhetoric achieves its persuasive force.

The consistently low scores on the strategic tension indices are particularly noteworthy. This suggests that, contrary to some characterizations of populist rhetoric as chaotic or contradictory, the discourse in these formal presidential speeches is carefully calibrated. The speaker appears to modulate the *salience* of potentially conflicting themes—such as democratic appeals and anti-pluralist attacks—to maintain a coherent message for a broad audience. This finding has significant implications for understanding the strategic sophistication of modern political communication. Future research could investigate whether this coherence holds in less formal settings, such as campaign rallies or social media, where the rhetorical constraints are different.

The most significant limitation of this study is its small sample size (*N*=6), which prevents the generalization of these findings and precluded the planned analysis of temporal and contextual effects. The descriptive patterns identified here are robust within this corpus but must be treated as preliminary. They serve as a strong foundation for future research. A larger-scale study, analyzing hundreds of speeches from various speakers and political systems, would be necessary to:
1.  Validate the "populist syndrome" structure identified here.
2.  Test whether the rhetorical style evolves over a presidential term.
3.  Determine how populist rhetoric is adapted for different speech contexts (e.g., inaugural vs. annual addresses).
4.  Assess whether the low strategic tension is a feature of this speaker or a broader characteristic of successful populist communication.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of six presidential speeches provides a detailed, data-driven portrait of a highly structured and strategically coherent populist rhetorical style. By applying the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF), this study moved beyond qualitative description to quantify the intensity and interplay of nine distinct populist themes. The findings reveal a "populist syndrome" organized around a core **Manichaean People-Elite** conflict, which is most powerfully articulated through narratives of **Economic Populism**, **Crisis-Restoration**, and **Nationalist Exclusion**.

The framework's novel measurement of strategic tension indicates that this rhetoric is deployed with considerable sophistication, avoiding overt contradictions that might alienate audiences. While the study's small sample size necessitates that these findings be considered preliminary, it successfully demonstrates the utility of the PDAF for dissecting political discourse and generates a clear set of testable hypotheses about the structure and strategy of modern populism. This research underscores the power of computational methods to bring new precision to the study of political communication and provides a validated methodological foundation for future, larger-scale investigations into this critical political phenomenon.
