Who would want to do that?\",\n  \"I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease... and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won\u2019t do it no matter what, five, five times I\u2019ve been up here. It\u2019s very sad, and it just shouldn\u2019t be this way.\",\n  \"We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me. How did that work out? Not too good, not too good.\",\n  \"America is back. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.\",\n  \"As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they\u2019ve never had anything like it.\",\n  \"My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again.\",\n  \"The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an Electoral College victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.\",\n  \"The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it.\",\n  \"Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you\u2019re going to be able to do that.\",\n  \"I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do... It\u2019s very sad, and it just shouldn\u2019t be this way.\",\n  \"We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me. How did that work out? Not too good, not too good.\",\n  \"Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately. Because we are draining the swamp, it\u2019s very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.\",\n  \"We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me.\",\n  \"The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We\u2019re going to.\",\n  \"Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging their daughter to use a new name and pronouns--they/them pronouns, actually \u2014 or without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse.\",\n  \"The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it.\",\n  \"I don\u2019t know about that list but we\u2019ll take it. Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they\u2019ve done.\",\n  \"And to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you\u2019re working very hard. He didn\u2019t need this, he didn\u2019t need this.\",\n  \"My fellow citizens: America is back. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.\",\n  \"More Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction \u2014 in fact it\u2019s an astonishing record, 27-point swing \u2014 the most ever.\",\n  \"Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.\",\n  \"Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they\u2019ve done.\",\n  \"We\u2019ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.\",\n  \"We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we\u2019re working with everybody involved to try and get it.

As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.\",\n  \"If you don\u2019t make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it\u2019s our turn to start using them against those other countries.\",\n  \"Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it\u2019s happening. And it will happen rather quickly.\"\n]\nTotal number of quotes in the composite analysis: 27\nTotal number of quotes in your output: 27",
