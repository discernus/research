Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\",\n  \"I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries... And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\",\n  \"Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest... Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions... that America must put its own citizens first. Because only then can we truly make America great again.\",\n  \"Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty... We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years... We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.\",\n  \"Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first.\",\n  \"My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.\",\n  \"Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people\",\n  \"To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\",\n  \"I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.\",\n  \"Their husbands... were slain in the line of duty in California... These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.\",\n  \"We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban... for a foreign government.\",\n  \"our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.\",\n  \"With this $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\",\n  \"I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.\",\n  \"Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first.\",\n  \"I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer.\",\n  \"Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first.\",\n  \"True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.\",\n  \"We are one people with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are made by the same God.\",\n  \"We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.\",\n  \"For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border. As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I've promised throughout the campaign.\",\n  \"It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America. We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\",\n  \"For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.\",\n  \"I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a long time since we had fair trade... I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer.\",\n  \"Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.\"\n]\nTotal quotes in analysis: 27\nTotal quotes in output: 27",
