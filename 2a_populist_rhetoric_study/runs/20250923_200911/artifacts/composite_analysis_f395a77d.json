To speed access to\\nbreakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year, the FDA\\napproved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever\\nbefore in our country's history. We also believe that patients with terminal\\nconditions and terminal illness should have access to experimental\\ntreatment immediately that could potentially save their lives.

Their two teenage\\ndaughters\u2014Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens\u2014were close friends on Long\\nIsland. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th birthday\u2014such a\\nhappy time it should have been\u2014neither of them came home. These two\\nprecious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their\\nhometown.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and\\nNisa's murders.

Thank you very much.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you.\\nWe love you.] Thank you.\\nWhile we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: we can make\\nsure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Tonight I am\\ncalling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed\\nMS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Tonight I am\\ncalling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed\\nMS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country.] We have\\nproposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our\\nICE and Border Patrol agents\u2014these are great people; these are great,\\ngreat people\u2014that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this\\ncan never happen again.\\nThe United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do\\nmore than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the\\nstruggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of\\nthe United States, [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant\\nconcern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and\\nAmerica's forgotten communities.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant\\nconcern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and\\nAmerica's forgotten communities.] I want our youth to grow up to achieve\\ngreat things. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I want our poor to have their chance to rise.]\\nSo tonight [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I am extending an open hand to work with members of both\\nparties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every\\nbackground, color, religion, and creed.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: My duty, and the sacred duty of\\nevery elected official in this Chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect\\ntheir safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the\\nAmerican Dream.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: My duty, and the sacred duty of\\nevery elected official in this Chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect\\ntheir safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the\\nAmerican Dream.] Because [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Americans are dreamers too.] Here tonight is one\\nleader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations\\nSpecial Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by \\\"D.J.\\\" and \\\"C.J.\\\" He said, \\\"Call\\nme either one.\\\" [Laughter] So we'll call you \\\"C.J.\\\" [Laughter] Served 15 years\\nin the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15\\nyears fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our\\nstreets. Tough job.\\nAt one point, MS-13 leaders ordered C.J.'s murder. And they wanted it to\\nhappen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he\\ncommanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His\\nteam has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang\\nmembers. And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done,\\nwe have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible\\npeople out of this country or into our prisons. So I just want to congratulate\\nyou, C.J. You're a brave guy. Thank you very much.\\nAnd [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I asked C.J., \\\"What's the secret?\\\" He said, \\\"We're just tougher than they\\nare.\\\" And I like that answer.] [Laughter] Now, [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: let's get Congress to send you\\n\u2014and all of the people in this great Chamber have to do it; we have no\\nchoice. C.J., we're going to send you reinforcements, and we're going to\\nsend them to you quickly. It's what you need.]\\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an\\nimmigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met\\nextensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan\\napproach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented\\nCongress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties\\nas a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but\\nwhere our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.\\nHere are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework\\ngenerously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who\\nwere brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost\\nthree times more people than the previous administration covered. Under\\nour plan, those who meet education and work requirements and show\\ngood moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United\\nStates over a 12-year period.\\nThe second pillar [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: fully secures the border. That means building a great wall\\non the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep\\nour communities safe.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes\\nexploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country], and [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: it finally ends\\nthe horrible and dangerous practice of catch-and-release.]\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out\\ngreen cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American\\npeople.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out\\ngreen cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American\\npeople.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: It's time to begin moving toward a merit-based immigration system,\\none that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will\\ncontribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.]\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain\\nmigration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring\\nin virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus\\non the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor\\nchildren. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for\\nour security and for the future of America.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring\\nin virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring\\nin virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.]\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by\\nthe visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs\\npresent risks we can just no longer afford.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_TEMPORAL_NARRATIVE: In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by\\nthe visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs\\npresent risks we can just no longer afford.] It's time to reform these\\noutdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into\\nthe 21st century. These four pillars represent a down-the-middle\\ncompromise and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful\\nimmigration system. For over 30 years, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Washington has tried and failed to\\nsolve this problem.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_TEMPORAL_NARRATIVE: For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to\\nsolve this problem.] This Congress can be the one that finally makes it\\nhappen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first.] So let's come\\ntogether, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.\\nThese reforms will also support our response to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_TEMPORAL_NARRATIVE: the terrible crisis of opioid\\nand drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible.] We\\nhave to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug\\noverdoses: 174 deaths per day, 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on\\ndrug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this\\nscourge.\\nMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping\\nget treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt.\\nThe struggle will be long, and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do,\\nin the end, [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: we will succeed. We will prevail.]\\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in\\nAmerica. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets\\nfamily of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the\\nAlbuquerque Police Department. He's here tonight with his wife Rebecca.\\nThank you, Ryan.\\nLast year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman\\npreparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her\\nunborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn't know where to\\nturn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \\\"You will do it, because\\nyou can.\\\" He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their\\nfour kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she\\nagreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and\\nRebecca, you embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you. Thank you,\\nRyan and Rebecca.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_TEMPORAL_NARRATIVE: As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also\\nrestoring our strength and standing abroad.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Around the world, we face\\nrogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that\\nchallenge our interests, our economy, and our values.] In confronting these\\nhorrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict and\\nunmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense.\\nFor this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense\\nsequester and fully fund our great military. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: As part of our defense, we must\\nmodernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully, never having to use\\nit, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of\\naggression by any other nation or anyone else.] Perhaps someday in the\\nfuture, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will\\nget together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not\\nthere yet, sadly.\\nLast year, [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish\\nISIS from the face of the Earth.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: One year later, I am proud to report that the\\ncoalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the\\nterritory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other\\nlocations as well. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue\\nour fight until ISIS is defeated.]\\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November,\\nJustin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission\\nto clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could\\nreturn to that city, hopefully, soon and, hopefully, safely.\\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely\\nwounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-\\ntrapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found\\nKenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and\\ninserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight\\nminutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration\\nthrough 2\u00bd hours and through emergency surgery.\\nKenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless love for his\\nfellow warrior. Tonight Kenton is recovering in Texas, Raqqa is liberated,\\nand Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \\\"V\\\" for valor. Staff Sergeant\\nPeck, all of America salutes you.\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.] When\\npossible, [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: we have no choice but to annihilate them.] When necessary, we\\nmust be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Terrorists\\nare not merely criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants. And when\\ncaptured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.]\\n[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of\\ndangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield, including\\nthe ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we\\nreleased.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_TEMPORAL_NARRATIVE: In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of\\ndangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield, including\\nthe ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we\\nreleased.] So today [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I'm keeping another promise.] I just signed, prior to\\nwalking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis\u2014who is doing a great job,\\nthank you\u2014to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open\\nthe detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. I am asking Congress to ensure\\nthat, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaida, we continue to have all necessary\\npower to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we\\nfind them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.\\nAt the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have\\nnew rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our\\nmilitary is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer\\ntell our enemies our plans.\\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate\\njust months before. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly\\nafterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General\\nAssembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General\\nAssembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: In 2016,\\nAmerican taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20\\nbillion in aid. That is why tonight I am asking Congress to pass legislation to\\nhelp ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American\\ninterests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America.]\\nAs we strengthen friendships all around the world, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: we are also restoring\\nclarity about our adversaries. When the people of Iran rose up against the\\ncrimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands\\nwith the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: When the people of Iran rose up against the\\ncrimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands\\nwith the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.] My\\nadministration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and\\nsocialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\\nBut [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than\\nthe cruel dictatorship in North Korea.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than\\nthe cruel dictatorship in North Korea.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: North Korea's reckless pursuit of\\nnuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_TEMPORAL_NARRATIVE: North Korea's reckless pursuit of\\nnuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_TEMPORAL_NARRATIVE: We are waging a\\ncampaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening. Past\\nexperience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite\\naggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past\\nadministrations that got us into this very dangerous position.] [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I will not repeat the mistakes of past\\nadministrations that got us into this very dangerous position.] We need only\\nlook at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand\\nthe nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.\\nOtto Warmbier was a hard-working student at the University of Virginia, and\\na great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a\\ntour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was\\narrested and charged with crimes against the state. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_TEMPORAL_NARRATIVE: After a shameful trial,\\nthe dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning\\nhim to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He\\npassed away just days after his return.]\\nOtto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us\\ntonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please.\\nIncredible people. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens\\nour world, and your strength truly inspires us all.] Thank you very much.\\nThank you. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Tonight we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American\\nresolve.] Thank you.\\nFinally\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We are joined by one more witness to the\\nominous nature of this regime.] His name is Mr. Ji Sung-ho. In 1996, Sung-ho\\nwas a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a\\nrailroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get.\\nIn the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.\\nHe woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple\\namputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and\\nsister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt\\nthemselves, permanently stunting their own growth.\\nLater, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a\\nbrief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any\\nChristians. He had, and he resolved, after that, to be free. Sung-ho traveled\\nthousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to\\nfreedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape\\nand was tortured to death.\\nToday, he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts\\ninto North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth. Today, he has a\\nnew leg. But, Sung-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a\\nreminder of how far you've come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us\\nall. Please. Thank you. Sung-ho's story is a testament to [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: the yearning of\\nevery human soul to live in freedom.]\\nIt was [CRISIS_RESTORATION_TEMPORAL_NARRATIVE: that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth\\nto a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught\\nbetween a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible\\npeople with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they\\ncould chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the\\nentire world.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans\\nhave always stood for, always strived for, and always done.] Atop the dome\\nof this Capitol stands the statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified\\namong the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to\\nprotect her: monuments to Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and King.\\nMemorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans\\nwho shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond;\\nand others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all\\nover Asia.
