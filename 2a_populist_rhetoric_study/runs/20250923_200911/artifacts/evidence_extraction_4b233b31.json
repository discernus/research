For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.\",\n  \"Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first. Because only then can we truly make America great again.\",\n  \"Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.\",\n  \"Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first.\",\n  \"We will keep our promises to the American people.\",\n  \"Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.\",\n  \"To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\",\n  \"Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.\",\n  \"We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.\",\n  \"We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban... on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\",\n  \"our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.\",\n  \"We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.\",\n  \"The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.\",\n  \"They told me\u2014without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it\u2014that it's very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.

My job is to represent the United States of America.\",\n  \"The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns. But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\",\n  \"Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right?

Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America. We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\",\n  \"For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.\",\n  \"I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer. I am going to bring back millions of jobs.\",\n  \"Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.\"\n]\nTotal quotes in the analysis: 27\nTotal quotes in my output: 27",
