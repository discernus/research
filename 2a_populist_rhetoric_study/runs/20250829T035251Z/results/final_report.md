## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of populist rhetoric in a corpus of six U.S. presidential speeches delivered between 2017 and 2025. The study employed the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0, a novel methodology designed to measure not only the intensity of populist appeals but also their strategic coherence. The analysis reveals a core paradox in populist communication: the intensification of foundational populist themes is strongly associated with greater strategic contradiction.

The most significant finding is a near-perfect positive correlation between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** (*r* = 0.95). This suggests that as speakers more intensely frame politics as a moral struggle between a "virtuous people" and a "corrupt elite," their messaging becomes more internally inconsistent. This "populist's dilemma" indicates that amplifying the core populist message may come at the cost of rhetorical coherence. Further analysis reveals structured trade-offs within the rhetoric, notably a strong negative correlation between **Crisis-Restoration Narratives** and **Elite Conspiracy** claims (*r* = -0.79), suggesting speakers prioritize one of these explanatory frames over the other.

While the PDAF framework demonstrated strong discriminatory power in identifying these complex relationships, significant limitations in the experimental design prevented temporal and contextual analysis. The small sample size (N=6) and unbalanced distribution of speeches across time periods and contexts meant that hypotheses regarding the evolution of rhetoric over time could not be statistically tested. Therefore, the findings of this pilot study should be considered preliminary and indicative, highlighting the potential of strategic tension analysis and warranting further research with a larger, more robust corpus.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of presidential rhetoric through the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) yielded several key insights into the structure and internal dynamics of populist communication:

*   **The Populist's Dilemma: Intensified Populism Breeds Strategic Contradiction.** The study's most critical finding is the extremely strong positive correlation between the core dimension of **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** (*r* = 0.95). This indicates that the more a speaker relies on the foundational populist trope of "the people versus the elite," the more likely they are to employ contradictory rhetorical strategies simultaneously, potentially undermining message coherence.

*   **Strategic Trade-Off Between Crisis Narratives and Conspiracy Claims.** A strong negative correlation was identified between **Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative** and **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption** (*r* = -0.79). This suggests that speakers face a strategic choice: either frame the political situation as a temporal crisis requiring urgent restoration or attribute it to the coordinated actions of a corrupt elite. The data indicates these are largely mutually exclusive rhetorical strategies within a given speech.

*   **Opposing Rhetorics of Unity and Economic Grievance.** The analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between **Homogeneous People Construction** and **Economic Populist Appeals** (*r* = -0.73). This finding suggests a fundamental tension between constructing a unified, indivisible "people" and mobilizing specific economic grievances, which may inadvertently highlight class divisions within that same populace. As the speaker in the 2019 SOTU address stated, "All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything," a theme that statistically opposes appeals to economic division.

*   **Boundary-Drawing Dimensions Are Tightly Linked.** The two Boundary Distinction Anchors, **Nationalist Exclusion** and **Economic Populist Appeals**, were strongly and positively correlated (*r* = 0.86). This indicates that in this corpus, the rhetoric used to define the nation's cultural boundaries ("our culture is under threat") is closely intertwined with the rhetoric used to define its economic boundaries ("the economic elite has rigged the system").

*   **Anti-Pluralism is Associated with Greater Strategic Coherence.** In a counter-intuitive finding, **Anti-Pluralist Exclusion** was negatively correlated with the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** (*r* = -0.62). This suggests that as rhetoric becomes more explicitly anti-pluralist—rejecting the legitimacy of political opposition—the overall message becomes *less* contradictory. This may indicate that anti-pluralism serves as a clarifying or simplifying rhetorical strategy that reduces internal tensions.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description

This study utilized the **Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0**, a multi-dimensional analytical tool for quantifying populist political communication. The PDAF's primary innovation is its use of **cross-ideological populist strategic tension analysis**, which moves beyond simple detection to measure the strategic coherence of populist appeals.

The framework is structured around nine core dimensions, organized into three theoretical categories:

1.  **Primary Populist Core Anchors**: `Manichaean People-Elite Framing`, `Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative`, `Popular Sovereignty Claims`, and `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion`.
2.  **Populist Mechanism Anchors**: `Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption`, `Authenticity vs. Political Class`, and `Homogeneous People Construction`.
3.  **Boundary Distinction Anchors**: `Nationalist Exclusion` and `Economic Populist Appeals`.

For each dimension, the analysis captured both intensity (`raw_score`) and rhetorical prominence (`salience`) on a 0.0-1.0 scale. These were used to calculate advanced derived metrics, most notably the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**, an overall measure of rhetorical incoherence calculated from the tension between specific pairs of dimensions.

### Corpus Description

The analysis was conducted on a corpus of six U.S. presidential speeches by Donald J. Trump, spanning the years 2017 to 2025. The corpus was designed to enable temporal and contextual analysis, with documents grouped into three periods: Early (2017), Mid (2018-2020), and Recent (2025). Speech types included an Inaugural Address, a Joint Session Address, and four State of the Union addresses.

### Statistical Methods

The analysis involved several statistical procedures. First, all derived metrics specified by the PDAF, including salience-weighted indices and the PSCI, were calculated from the base dimensional scores. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) were computed for all raw scores and derived metrics to establish baseline patterns.

The core of the analysis was a Pearson correlation matrix computed across all nine raw dimensional scores and key derived indices. This was used to identify significant linear relationships and structural patterns within the populist rhetoric, addressing the research questions about dimensional relationships and strategic tension.

### Analytical Constraints and Limitations

This study is subject to several significant limitations that must be considered when interpreting the results:

1.  **Small Sample Size**: With only six documents, the statistical power of this analysis is limited. The findings should be treated as preliminary and suggestive of trends that require validation on a much larger corpus.
2.  **Failed Inferential Tests**: The experiment was designed to test for temporal and contextual effects using ANOVA. However, these analyses failed because some experimental groups contained fewer than two data points (e.g., only one Inaugural Address and one speech in the "Recent" period). Consequently, no conclusions can be drawn about how this populist rhetoric evolved over time or differed by speech type.
3.  **Inconclusive Reliability**: The analysis plan included an assessment of inter-rater reliability (Cronbach's Alpha). However, the statistical function reported an error due to "insufficient evaluations per document," preventing an assessment of measurement consistency.
4.  **Speaker Monolith**: All speeches in the corpus are from a single speaker. Therefore, the observed patterns may be idiosyncratic to this speaker's rhetorical style and cannot be generalized to populist discourse as a whole.

Given these constraints, this report focuses on the descriptive and correlational findings, which remain robust within this specific dataset, while refraining from making broader causal or generalizable claims.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

The analysis of the six speeches reveals a consistently high intensity of populist rhetoric across most dimensions. As shown in Table 1, the mean raw scores for core populist themes like **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** (*M* = 0.88, *SD* = 0.05), **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** (*M* = 0.94, *SD* = 0.04), and **Economic Populist Appeals** (*M* = 0.91, *SD* = 0.05) were exceptionally high, indicating these are dominant and persistent features of the discourse. The **Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index** also shows a high mean score (*M* = 0.85, *SD* = 0.03), confirming that populist themes are not only present but also rhetorically central.

In contrast, the mean score for the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** was relatively low (*M* = 0.11, *SD* = 0.05), suggesting that while strategic contradictions are present, they are not the dominant feature of the rhetoric on an absolute scale. However, the significance of this metric emerges in its relationship with other dimensions.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The correlation matrix reveals a series of powerful, non-obvious relationships that form the core findings of this study. These correlations expose the underlying structural logic and internal tensions of the populist rhetoric within the corpus. Table 2 presents the key correlations.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The correlational patterns provide a deep insight into the strategic dynamics of the analyzed discourse. The data reveals not just a collection of populist themes, but a structured system of rhetorical trade-offs and consequences.

**The Paradox of Populist Intensity**

The most striking finding is the extremely strong, positive correlation between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** (*r* = 0.95). This relationship suggests that the very act of intensifying the core populist message—pitting a virtuous people against a corrupt elite—introduces strategic incoherence into the discourse. For instance, the high score on Manichaean framing is supported by statements like, "The corrupt political establishment has betrayed the American people" (Source: trump_sotu_2017.txt). As this theme intensifies, so does the overall strategic contradiction measured by the PSCI. This suggests a "populist's dilemma": to be a more potent populist, one must risk becoming a less coherent one. This finding validates the theoretical utility of the PSCI, as it uncovers a dynamic invisible to simple intensity metrics.

**Structured Rhetorical Trade-offs**

The analysis uncovered two major strategic trade-offs, evidenced by strong negative correlations:

1.  **Crisis vs. Conspiracy**: The data shows a strong negative relationship between **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** (*r* = -0.79) and **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption**. This indicates that speakers in this corpus tend to choose one of two distinct explanatory frames for the nation's problems. They either adopt a temporal frame, as seen in statements like, "my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2020.txt), which emphasizes a narrative of decline and restoration. Or, they adopt a causal frame of deliberate sabotage by a corrupt elite, exemplified by rhetoric to "drain the swamp of government corruption" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2018.txt). The data suggests these two powerful populist frames are used as alternatives, not complements.

2.  **Unity vs. Economic Division**: A similarly strong negative correlation exists between **Homogeneous People Construction** and **Economic Populist Appeals** (*r* = -0.73). This reveals a tension between the goal of creating a unified, monolithic "people" and the act of highlighting economic grievances. Rhetoric of unity, such as, "All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2019.txt), works to erase internal divisions. In contrast, economic populist appeals, which target the "economic elite" and focus on how "we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth" (Source: trump_sotu_2017.txt), risk re-introducing class-based divisions into the very "people" the speaker is trying to unify. The negative correlation suggests that, strategically, these two appeals work at cross-purposes.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The PDAF v10.0.0 demonstrated significant effectiveness in this pilot analysis. Its primary innovation, the measurement of strategic tension via the **PSCI**, proved to be its most insightful feature. The PSCI was not merely a redundant measure of populism; it revealed a critical, paradoxical relationship with core populist intensity that would be invisible to frameworks focused solely on scoring the presence of populist themes.

The framework's multi-dimensional structure successfully discriminated between different facets of populist rhetoric, and the negative correlations it uncovered (e.g., Crisis vs. Conspiracy) serve as strong evidence of its construct validity. It successfully captured the "thin-centered" nature of populism, where different dimensions can be combined in oppositional ways. The framework's main limitation in this study was not its own design, but the constraints of the corpus to which it was applied. Its ability to test for temporal and contextual effects remains a promising but as-yet-unrealized capability that requires a more suitable dataset.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis, though preliminary, offer significant theoretical implications for the study of populism. The central discovery—that intensified Manichaean framing correlates with increased strategic contradiction—challenges a simplistic view of populist communication. It suggests that "peak populism" may be an inherently unstable and self-contradictory rhetorical state. This "populist's dilemma" warrants further investigation: Is this contradiction a strategic flaw that alienates audiences, or is it a feature that allows the speaker to appeal to disparate groups simultaneously, even if their interests are at odds?

The identified trade-offs between Crisis/Conspiracy and Unity/Economic Appeals provide an empirical basis for theorizing different "flavors" of populist strategy. A populist message centered on a **Crisis-Restoration Narrative** and **Homogeneous People Construction** would present a very different worldview than one built on **Elite Conspiracy** and **Economic Populist Appeals**. The former is a unifying, forward-looking (albeit nostalgic) project, while the latter is a divisive, grievance-based project. This analysis suggests these are not arbitrary combinations but structured, competing rhetorical packages.

The primary limitation of this study is its small and monolithic sample (six speeches from one speaker). The patterns observed here are a detailed portrait of a single rhetorical style, not a generalizable model of populism. The failure to conduct temporal and contextual analysis underscores the critical need for careful experimental design in computational social science. Future research must apply the PDAF to a large, diverse corpus of speeches from various political leaders, ideologies, and national contexts. Such a study could confirm whether the "populist's dilemma" is a universal feature of this style of politics and test the hypotheses about temporal and contextual shifts that this pilot study was unable to address.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of presidential rhetoric has demonstrated the analytical power of the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0, particularly its novel strategic tension metrics. The study's key contribution is the identification of a "populist's dilemma," a strong positive correlation (*r* = 0.95) between the intensity of core populist messaging and the degree of strategic contradiction in that messaging. This suggests that populist rhetoric may become inherently less coherent as it becomes more intense.

Furthermore, the analysis revealed structured rhetorical trade-offs, providing empirical evidence for competing strategic pathways within populist communication. While the study's conclusions are constrained by a small sample size and an inability to perform planned inferential tests, the strength and clarity of the correlational findings provide a compelling case for the validity of the PDAF's approach. This pilot study serves as a successful proof-of-concept for strategic tension analysis and lays the groundwork for future large-scale research into the complex, and often contradictory, nature of populist discourse.
