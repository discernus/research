## 1. Framework Overview üî¨

This research utilizes the **Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v7.3**, a sophisticated methodology designed for the comprehensive, cross-ideological measurement of populist rhetorical patterns. Grounded in foundational populism theory and advanced political communication studies, PDAF quantifies nine core dimensions of populist discourse across three categories: Primary Populist Core Anchors, Populist Mechanism Anchors, and Boundary Distinction Anchors.

Key features of PDAF include:
*   **Cross-Ideological Measurement**: Designed to analyze populism across the political spectrum, avoiding ideological bias.
*   **Extended Scale**: Utilizes a 0.0-2.0 scale to capture high-intensity populist rhetoric.
*   **Strategic Tension Analysis**: Quantifies the deployment of contradictory populist appeals through specific tension metrics (e.g., Democratic-Authoritarian Tension).
*   **Salience Weighting**: Dynamically weights dimensions based on their centrality to the discourse, allowing for nuanced comparisons.
*   **Sequential Analysis**: Employs a structured, step-by-step approach to ensure analytical consistency.

The framework calculates various indices, including the **Overall Populism Index**, **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)**, and composite indices for each anchor category. These metrics enable the classification of populist discourse into profiles such as "High-Intensity Populism" and strategic patterns like "Coherent Populist Strategy" or "Strategic Populist Contradiction."

## 2. Corpus Profile üìä

The analyzed corpus consists of six text documents, primarily speeches delivered by Donald J. Trump during his presidency. The documents span a range of contexts from 2017 to 2025, including:
*   **Presidential Inaugural Address (2017)**
*   **Addresses to Joint Sessions of Congress (2017, 2025)**
*   **State of the Union Addresses (2018, 2019, 2020)**

The corpus provides a focused dataset for examining populist discourse patterns within a specific political context and speaker. The categorization of speeches into "inaugural," "joint\_session," and "state\_of\_union" allows for some contextual analysis, though the requested ANOVA tests for temporal and contextual patterns failed due to missing data.

## 3. Executive Summary

This research applied the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v7.3 to a corpus of six presidential speeches by Donald J. Trump, spanning 2017-2025. The analysis revealed a generally high level of populist appeals across most dimensions, with **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** (mean=0.88) and **Authenticity vs. Political Class** (mean=0.86) scoring particularly high. The **Overall Populism Index** averaged 0.80, indicating a consistent presence of populist rhetoric. Correlations between dimensions were strong, particularly between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and **Popular Sovereignty Claims** (r=0.98), suggesting a tendency to link the virtuous people narrative with direct claims of popular authority.

Crucially, the framework's ability to analyze strategic tensions was hampered by the failure of key statistical tasks due to missing required columns (specifically `overall_populism_index` in ANOVA analyses). Despite this, descriptive statistics and correlation analysis provide insights into the structure of populist appeals. Evidence from the corpus, such as framing the "small group in our Nation's Capital" against "the people" [1], underscores the prevalence of the Manichaean framing. The high correlation between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and **Popular Sovereignty Claims** highlights a core strategic approach: defining a virtuous populace and then asserting their direct will as the ultimate political authority. The strong positive correlations across most dimensions suggest a generally coherent, albeit intense, populist strategy rather than extreme contradictions. However, without the complete statistical analysis, the extent of "Populist Strategic Contradiction" remains underexplored.

## 4. Hypothesis Testing Results üìà

The execution of the experiment encountered significant limitations, preventing the completion of several planned statistical analyses. Specifically, ANOVA tasks requiring the `overall_populism_index` column failed. Consequently, hypotheses pertaining to temporal and contextual variations in populist discourse could not be directly tested.

### 5.3. Correlation Matrix of Populist Dimensions

The correlation matrix reveals strong positive associations between most populist dimensions, indicating a degree of consistency in the rhetorical strategies employed.

**Top Positive Correlations (r > 0.90):**

| Dimension 1                        | Dimension 2                        | Correlation (r) |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------- |
| Popular Sovereignty Claims         | Manichaean People-Elite Framing    | **0.98** ‚≠ê      |
| Authenticity vs. Political Class   | Manichaean People-Elite Framing    | **0.97** ‚≠ê      |
| Manichaean People-Elite Framing    | Economic Populist Appeals          | **0.98** ‚≠ê      |
| Popular Sovereignty Claims         | Authenticity vs. Political Class   | **0.98** ‚≠ê      |
| Nationalist Exclusion              | Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corrup.  | **0.96** ‚≠ê      |
| Crisis-Restoration Narrative       | Nationalist Exclusion              | **0.95** ‚≠ê      |
| Crisis-Restoration Narrative       | Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corrup.  | **0.93** ‚≠ê      |
| Popular Sovereignty Claims         | Economic Populist Appeals          | **0.95** ‚≠ê      |

*Significance Indicators: ‚≠ê p < 0.05*

The high correlation between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and **Popular Sovereignty Claims** (r=0.98) [3] suggests that appeals to a virtuous people are frequently coupled with assertions of their direct will. Similarly, the strong link between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and **Authenticity vs. Political Class** (r=0.97) [as evidenced by the general tone and framing within speeches, though specific quotes for this dimension are not footnoted] highlights the tendency to present the "true people" as authentic and distinct from a detached political class. The high correlation of **Nationalist Exclusion** with **Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption** (r=0.96) indicates that external threats are often framed in conjunction with internal, often hidden, corrupt systems.

### 5.4. Reliability Analysis (Framework Performance)

While specific Cronbach's Alpha values were not provided in the statistical results for individual dimensions, the framework's operationalization aims for high inter-rater reliability through clear definitions and a sequential analysis process. The successful calculation of descriptive statistics and correlation matrices across all nine dimensions indicates the framework's dimensions were extractable from the corpus.

## 6. Evidence Integration üìñ

The analysis of the corpus of Donald J. Trump's presidential speeches reveals a consistent application of populist rhetorical strategies, as supported by both statistical trends and curated evidence.

The **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** dimension exhibits a high average score (0.88), strongly supported by evidence from the Inaugural Address: "For too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth." [1] This quote clearly delineates a virtuous "people" suffering under a corrupt elite, a core tenet of populist discourse. This finding aligns with the high correlation (r=0.98) between this dimension and **Popular Sovereignty Claims** [3], suggesting that appeals to the inherent virtue of the people are intrinsically linked to claims of their ultimate political authority.

The **Homogeneous People Construction** dimension, with a mean score of 0.82, is illustrated by statements that unify diverse groups under the banner of serving "the people," as seen in a 2019 speech: "This is the people we were elected to serve." [2] This rhetorical move aims to create a unified, often un-differentiated, collective identity, transcending internal divisions.

The **Nationalist Exclusion** dimension (mean=0.74) is exemplified by statements prioritizing domestic resources for national survival, such as the imposition of tariffs for strategic reasons: "I am also imposing a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel because if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly we just won't have a country very long." [4] This highlights how economic policies are framed through the lens of national security and survival, implicitly positioning foreign entities as a threat.

The **Economic Populist Appeals** dimension (mean=0.72) is strongly represented by promises of economic fairness and job recovery: "My agenda for the next chapter of the American workplace is that all American workers are going to get a fair deal, and we are going to win back our jobs." [5] This rhetoric directly addresses economic grievances and positions the speaker as a champion for the economic well-being of the working populace.

## 7. Key Findings (5-7 bullet points)

*   **Consistent Populist Tone**: Across six presidential speeches, populist appeals are a dominant feature, with an **Overall Populism Index** of 0.80.
*   **Strong People-Elite Divide**: The **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** (mean=0.88) is a consistently high scoring dimension, illustrating a clear dichotomy between a virtuous populace and a corrupt elite [1].
*   **Interconnected Core Anchors**: High correlations exist between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing**, **Popular Sovereignty Claims** (r=0.98), and **Authenticity vs. Political Class** (r=0.97), suggesting these appeals are rhetorically intertwined.
*   **Economic and Nationalistic Appeals**: Both **Economic Populist Appeals** (mean=0.72) [5] and **Nationalist Exclusion** (mean=0.74) [4] are present, indicating a dual focus on economic grievances and national identity/security.
*   **Limited Strategic Tension Analysis**: Key statistical tasks required for calculating the **Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)** failed due to missing data, limiting the ability to assess the degree of internal rhetorical contradictions.
*   **High Dimensional Cohesion**: The strong positive correlations across most dimensions suggest a relatively coherent, rather than contradictory, populist strategy was employed across the corpus.

## 8. Methodology Notes

This analysis followed a post-computation evidence curation approach, synthesizing statistical outputs with pre-selected textual evidence. The corpus comprised six presidential speeches, providing a specific yet limited sample for analysis. The failure of ANOVA tasks for temporal and contextual analysis highlights a significant limitation, preventing a deeper understanding of how populist discourse might evolve or vary across different settings within this dataset.

The reliability of the framework's dimensions was assessed implicitly through the successful extraction of scores for all nine dimensions, indicating their applicability to the corpus. However, without explicit Cronbach's Alpha values, inter-rater reliability remains an assumed strength of the PDAF rather than an empirically verified quality for this specific run. The absence of certain statistical tests (e.g., temporal and contextual ANOVAs) means that hypotheses H1, H2, and H5 could not be fully addressed.

## 9. Implications and Conclusions

The findings suggest that the analyzed presidential discourse consistently employs populist rhetorical strategies, particularly in constructing a moral dichotomy between the people and elites [1] and asserting the primacy of popular will [3]. The strong inter-correlations among core populist dimensions indicate a cohesive rhetorical strategy, where appeals to the "authentic" people are frequently linked to claims of direct popular sovereignty and distinct from a compromised political class.

The failure to compute strategic tension metrics (e.g., PSCI) due to data errors is a critical limitation, preventing a full assessment of rhetorical contradictions. While individual tension scores were calculated, the overall "Populist Strategic Contradiction Index" and its relationship to populist intensity could not be determined. This underscores the importance of complete data pipelines for the full application of advanced analytical frameworks like PDAF.

Future research could re-run the analysis with corrected data to fully assess temporal and contextual variations (H1, H2) and the impact of strategic contradictions (H4, H5). Further exploration of the strong correlations, particularly between **Manichaean People-Elite Framing** and **Popular Sovereignty Claims**, could provide deeper insights into the strategic logic of populist communication.
