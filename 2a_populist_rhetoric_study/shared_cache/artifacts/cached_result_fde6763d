Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of\\nCongress, the First Lady of the United States, and citizens of America:\\nTonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History\\nMonth, we are reminded of our Nation's path towards civil rights and the\\nwork that still remains to be done. Recent threats targeting Jewish\\ncommunity centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last\\nweek's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation\\ndivided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate\\nand evil in all of its very ugly forms. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty, and justice in\\nan unbroken chain, all the way down to the present.] That torch is now in\\nour hands, and we will use it to light up the world. [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I am here tonight to\\ndeliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply\\ndelivered from my heart.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: A new chapter of American greatness is now\\nbeginning.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.] And [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: a new\\nsurge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.]\\n\\nWhat we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our\\nallies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the\\nworld\u2014friend or foe\u2014will find that America is strong, America is proud, and\\nAmerica is free.\\nIn 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our\\nfounding: 250 years since the day we declared our independence. But what will\\nAmerica look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we\\nleave for our children?\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of\\nour future.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've\\nexported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: We've financed and built\\none global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the\\ninner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places\\nthroughout our land.]\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own\\nborders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now\\nunprecedented rate.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars\\noverseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a\\nquiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just\\nwanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.]\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens\\nnow spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.]\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by\\nthe tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial\\ndemand: that America must put its own citizens first.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Because only then can\\nwe truly make America great again.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Dying industries will come roaring back to life.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Heroic veterans will get the\\ncare they so desperately need.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our military will be given the resources its\\nbrave warriors so richly deserve.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced\\nwith new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our\\nvery, very beautiful land.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and,\\nultimately, stop.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope,\\nsafety, and opportunity.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Above all else, we will keep our promises to the\\nAmerican people.] [Applause] Thank you.\\nIt's been a little over a month since my Inauguration, and I want to take this\\nmoment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those\\npromises.\\nSince my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank,\\nLockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others have announced that they will\\ninvest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens\\nof thousands of new American jobs.\\nThe stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on\\nNovember 8\u2014a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of\\ndollars by bringing down the price of fantastic\u2014and it is a fantastic\u2014new F35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our\\nGovernment. We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and\\nnonessential Federal workers.\\n[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing\\na 5-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban\u2014\\n[applause]\u2014thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming\\nlobbyists for a foreign government.]\\nWe have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing\\nregulations, creating a deregulation Task Force inside of every Government\\nagency. And we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one\\nnew regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. We're going to stop\\nthe regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal\\nminers.\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota\\nAccess pipelines, thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: And I've issued\\na new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific\\nPartnership.] And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have\\nformed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women\\nentrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets, and capital they need\\nto start a business and live out their financial dreams.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a\\nTask Force on Reducing Violent Crime.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I have further ordered the\\nDepartments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department\\nof State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an\\naggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all\\nacross our Nation.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and\\npoisoning our youth], and we will expand treatment for those who have\\nbecome so badly addicted.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the\\nAmerican people for immigration enforcement and border security.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: By\\nfinally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the\\nunemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our\\ncommunities safer for everyone.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We want all Americans to succeed, but\\nthat can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We must restore\\nintegrity and the rule of law at our borders.]\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall\\nalong our southern border.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: As we speak tonight, we are removing gang\\nmembers, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and\\nprey on our very innocent citizens.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Bad ones are going out as I speak, and\\nas I've promised throughout the campaign.]\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would\\nask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that\\nloses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused\\nto uphold its laws and defend its borders?]\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United\\nStates.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from\\nradical Islamic terrorism.] According to data provided by the Department of\\nJustice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorismrelated offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We\\nhave seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the\\nPentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.]\\n\\nWe have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over\\nthe world. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry\\nfrom places where proper vetting cannot occur.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Those given the high honor\\nof admission to the United States should support this country and love its\\npeople and its values.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form\\ninside America.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for\\nextremists.]\\nThat is why my administration has been working on improved vetting\\nprocedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe and\\nto keep those out who will do us harm.\\nI directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to\\ndemolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have\\nslaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children of\\nall faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends\\nand allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our\\nplanet.\\nI have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support\\nIran's ballistic missile program and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance\\nwith the State of Israel.\\nFinally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States\\nSupreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.\\nI am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.\\nThank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be\\na symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil\\nGorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was\\nconfirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate\\nto swiftly approve his nomination.\\nTonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we must\\nhonestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Ninety-four million\\nAmericans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living\\nin poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1\\nin 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst\\nfinancial recovery in 65 years.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: In the last 8 years, the past administration\\nhas put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA\\nwas approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World\\nTrade Organization in 2001.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Our trade deficit in goods with the world last\\nyear was nearly $800 billion dollars.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: And overseas we have inherited a\\nseries of tragic foreign policy disasters.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Solving these and so many other\\npressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.] It\\nwill require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every\\nchallenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our\\ngoals at home and abroad, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we must restart the engine of the American\\neconomy], [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: making it easier for companies to do business in the United\\nStates, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Right now American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates\\nanywhere in the world.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: My economic team is developing historic tax reform\\nthat will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and\\nthrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We\\nmust create a level playing field for American companies and our workers\u2014\\nhave to do it.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other\\ncountries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign\\ncompanies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or\\nalmost nothing.]\\nI just met with officials and workers from a great American company,\\nHarley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent\\nmotorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.\\n[Laughter]\\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They\\nsaid that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other\\ncountries, mainly international sales? [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: They told me\u2014without even\\ncomplaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've\\nbecome used to it\u2014that it's very hard to do business with other countries\\nbecause they tax our goods at such a high rate. They weren't even asking\\nfor a change. But I am.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a\\nlong time since we had fair trade.] The first Republican President, Abraham\\nLincoln, warned that the \\\"abandonment of the protective policy by the\\nAmerican Government will produce want and ruin among our people.\\\"\\nLincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I am\\nnot going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken\\nadvantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No\\nlonger.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I am going to bring back millions of jobs.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Protecting our workers also means\\nreforming our system of legal immigration.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: The current, outdated system\\ndepresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on\\ntaxpayers.] Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many\\nothers, have a merit-based immigration system. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: It's a basic principle that\\nthose seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves\\nfinancially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very\\npublic resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: According to the\\nNational Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs\\nAmerican taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and\\ninstead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more\\nbenefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help\\nstruggling families\u2014including immigrant families\u2014enter the middle class.]\\nAnd they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.\\nI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we\\nfocus on the following goals: [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to\\nstrengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: If we\\nare guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans\\nand Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded\\nour country for decades.]\\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly\\ngreat national infrastructure program\u2014the building of the Interstate\\nHighway System. The time has come for a new program of national\\nrebuilding. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East;\\nall the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: With this $6 trillion,\\nwe could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we\\nhad people who had the ability to negotiate.] [Laughter]\\n\\nTo launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve\\nlegislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the\\nUnited States\u2014financed through both public and private capital\u2014creating\\nmillions of new jobs. This effort will be guided by two core principles: [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: buy\\nAmerican and hire American.]\\nTonight I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare\\nwith reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the\\nsame time, provide better health care.\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance\\nwas never the right solution for our country.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: The way to make health\\ninsurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and\\nthat is what we are going do.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple\\ndigits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State\\n\u2014the State of Kentucky\u2014and it's unsustainable and collapsing.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: One-third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them\\nfast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans\\nhave no choice at all. There's no choice left.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Remember when you were told\\nthat you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all\\nof those promises have been totally broken.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Obamacare is collapsing, and\\nwe must act decisively to protect all Americans.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: So I am calling on all Democrats and\\nRepublicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this\\nimploding Obamacare disaster.]\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to\\ncreate a better health care system for all Americans:\\nFirst, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have\\naccess to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans\\ncurrently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through\\nthe use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be\\nthe plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.\\nThirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility\\nthey need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\\nFourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and\\ndoctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and\\nwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down\\nimmediately. And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom\\nto purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly\\ncompetitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and\\nprovide far better care. So important.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be\\nsolved.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: And every hurting family can find healing and hope.]\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and\\nfinally get the job done, and get it done right?] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: On this and so many other\\nthings, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the\\ngood of our country and for the good of the American people.]\\nMy administration wants to work with members of both parties to make\\nchildcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they\\nhave paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean\\nair and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\\ndeserves a much brighter future.]\\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an\\ninspiration to us all.\\nToday is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery\\nis a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.\\nMegan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when\\nshe was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving\\nthis news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life\\nof his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped\\ndevelop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a\\nsophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a\\ndaughter. But [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and\\nDrug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved\\nMegan's life, from reaching those in need.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: If we slash the restraints, not just\\nat the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far\\nmore miracles just like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation\\nof miracles.]\\nBut to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every\\nAmerican child. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Education is the civil rights issue of our time.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I am calling\\nupon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school\\nchoice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and\\nLatino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private,\\ncharter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.]\\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha\\nMerriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third\\ngrade twice. But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning\\n\u2014great learning center\u2014with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship\\nprogram.\\nToday, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school,\\nbut from college. Later this year she will get her master's degree in social\\nwork. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like\\nDenisha.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\\nThe murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in\\nnearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last\\nyear alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This\\nis not acceptable in our society.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to\\nattend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: But to create\\nthis future, we must work with, not against\u2014not against\u2014the men and\\nwomen of law enforcement.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We must build bridges of cooperation and\\ntrust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is\u2014division. It's\\npure, unadulterated division. We have to unify.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and\\nneighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave\\nbehind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come\\nhome safe and sound.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We must support the incredible men and women of\\nlaw enforcement.]\\nAnd we must support the victims of crime. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: I have ordered the Department\\nof Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The\\noffice is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: We are\\nproviding a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and\\nsilenced by special interests.] Joining us in the audience tonight are four very\\nbrave Americans whose Government failed them. Their names are Jamiel\\nShaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant\\ngang member who had just been released from prison.] Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was\\nan incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to\\ngo to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\\nBut he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has\\nbecome a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy\\nSheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of\\nduty in California. They were pillars of their community. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: These brave men\\nwere viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record\\nand two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.]\\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that\\nyour father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire\\ncountry supporting you and praying for you.\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never\\nstop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We\\nwill always honor their memory.]\\n\\nFinally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the\\nUnited States military with the tools they need to prevent war. If they must,\\nthey have to fight and they only have to win.\\nI am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the\\ndefense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national\\ndefense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding\\nfor our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we\\nmust deliver for them.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even\\ngreater. And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for\\nAmerica in uniform.]\\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S.\\nNavy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \\\"Ryan\\\" Owens. Ryan died as he\\nlived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our\\nNation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed\\nthat\u2014and I quote\u2014\\\"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that\\ngenerated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more\\nvictories in the future against our enemy.\\\" Ryan's legacy is etched into\\neternity. Thank you. [Applause] And Ryan is looking down, right now\u2014you\\nknow that\u2014and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\\n[Laughter]\\nFor as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down\\none's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his\\ncountry, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.\\nTo those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no\\nfurther than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a\\ndirect, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American\\nleadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all\\nacross the globe.\\nWe strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two\\nworld wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated\\ncommunism.\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on\\nour very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In\\nfact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We expect our\\npartners\u2014whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific\u2014to take a\\ndirect and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and\\npay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.]\\nWe will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of\\nall nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Free\\nnations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people], and\\nAmerica respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: My job is\\nnot to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of\\nAmerica.]\\nBut we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.\\nWe must learn from the mistakes of the past. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We have seen the war and the\\ndestruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world\u2014all across\\nthe world.] The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in\\nmany cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely\\nreturn home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.\\nAmerica is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where\\nshared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\\nWe want peace, wherever peace can be found.\\nAmerica is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies,\\ndecades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.\\nThis history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\\nHopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful,\\nmore just, and more free.\\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to\\nPhiladelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the\\ncountry's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful\\ncreations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\\nRemington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at\\nelectric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric\\npen. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\\nThink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our\\npeople.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much\\nto hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets\\nwhere mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace,\\nand jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever\\nbefore\u2014for all Americans.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can\\nonly get there together. We are one people with one destiny. We all bleed\\nthe same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are\\nmade by the same God.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious\\nfreedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of\\nAmerican greatness began.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: The time for small thinking is over. The time for\\ntrivial fights is behind us.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We just need the courage to share the dreams\\nthat fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and\\nthe confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened\\nby our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and\\nguided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I am\\nasking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and\\ndaring things for our country.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I am asking everyone watching tonight to\\nseize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe,\\nonce more, in America.]\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.\\n\\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:09 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S.\\nCapitol.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of\\nCongress, the First Lady of the United States, and citizens of America:\\nTonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History\\nMonth, we are reminded of our Nation's path towards civil rights and the\\nwork that still remains to be done. Recent threats targeting Jewish\\ncommunity centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last\\nweek's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation\\ndivided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate\\nand evil in all of its very ugly forms. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty, and justice in\\nan unbroken chain, all the way down to the present.] That torch is now in\\nour hands, and we will use it to light up the world. [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I am here tonight to\\ndeliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply\\ndelivered from my heart.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: A new chapter of American greatness is now\\nbeginning.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.] And [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: a new\\nsurge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.]\\n\\nWhat we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our\\nallies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the\\nworld\u2014friend or foe\u2014will find that America is strong, America is proud, and\\nAmerica is free.\\nIn 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our\\nfounding: 250 years since the day we declared our independence. But what will\\nAmerica look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we\\nleave for our children?\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of\\nour future.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've\\nexported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: We've financed and built\\none global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the\\ninner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places\\nthroughout our land.]\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own\\nborders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now\\nunprecedented rate.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars\\noverseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a\\nquiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just\\nwanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.]\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens\\nnow spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.]\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by\\nthe tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial\\ndemand: that America must put its own citizens first.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Because only then can\\nwe truly make America great again.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Dying industries will come roaring back to life.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Heroic veterans will get the\\ncare they so desperately need.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our military will be given the resources its\\nbrave warriors so richly deserve.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced\\nwith new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our\\nvery, very beautiful land.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and,\\nultimately, stop.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope,\\nsafety, and opportunity.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Above all else, we will keep our promises to the\\nAmerican people.] [Applause] Thank you.\\nIt's been a little over a month since my Inauguration, and I want to take this\\nmoment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those\\npromises.\\nSince my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank,\\nLockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others have announced that they will\\ninvest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens\\nof thousands of new American jobs.\\nThe stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on\\nNovember 8\u2014a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of\\ndollars by bringing down the price of fantastic\u2014and it is a fantastic\u2014new F35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our\\nGovernment. We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and\\nnonessential Federal workers.\\n[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing\\na 5-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban\u2014\\n[applause]\u2014thank you. Thank you. And a lifetime ban on becoming\\nlobbyists for a foreign government.]\\nWe have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing\\nregulations, creating a deregulation Task Force inside of every Government\\nagency. And we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one\\nnew regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. We're going to stop\\nthe regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal\\nminers.\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota\\nAccess pipelines, thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: And I've issued\\na new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific\\nPartnership.] And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have\\nformed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women\\nentrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets, and capital they need\\nto start a business and live out their financial dreams.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a\\nTask Force on Reducing Violent Crime.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I have further ordered the\\nDepartments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department\\nof State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an\\naggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all\\nacross our Nation.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and\\npoisoning our youth], and we will expand treatment for those who have\\nbecome so badly addicted.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the\\nAmerican people for immigration enforcement and border security.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: By\\nfinally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the\\nunemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our\\ncommunities safer for everyone.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We want all Americans to succeed, but\\nthat can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We must restore\\nintegrity and the rule of law at our borders.]\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall\\nalong our southern border.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: As we speak tonight, we are removing gang\\nmembers, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and\\nprey on our very innocent citizens.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Bad ones are going out as I speak, and\\nas I've promised throughout the campaign.]\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would\\nask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that\\nloses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused\\nto uphold its laws and defend its borders?]\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United\\nStates.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from\\nradical Islamic terrorism.] According to data provided by the Department of\\nJustice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorismrelated offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We\\nhave seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the\\nPentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.]\\n\\nWe have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over\\nthe world. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry\\nfrom places where proper vetting cannot occur.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Those given the high honor\\nof admission to the United States should support this country and love its\\npeople and its values.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form\\ninside America.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for\\nextremists.]\\nThat is why my administration has been working on improved vetting\\nprocedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe and\\nto keep those out who will do us harm.\\nI directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to\\ndemolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have\\nslaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children of\\nall faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends\\nand allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our\\nplanet.\\nI have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support\\nIran's ballistic missile program and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance\\nwith the State of Israel.\\nFinally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States\\nSupreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.\\nI am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.\\nThank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be\\na symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil\\nGorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was\\nconfirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate\\nto swiftly approve his nomination.\\nTonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we must\\nhonestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Ninety-four million\\nAmericans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living\\nin poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1\\nin 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst\\nfinancial recovery in 65 years.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: In the last 8 years, the past administration\\nhas put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA\\nwas approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World\\nTrade Organization in 2001.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Our trade deficit in goods with the world last\\nyear was nearly $800 billion dollars.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: And overseas we have inherited a\\nseries of tragic foreign policy disasters.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Solving these and so many other\\npressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.] It\\nwill require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every\\nchallenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our\\ngoals at home and abroad, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we must restart the engine of the American\\neconomy], [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: making it easier for companies to do business in the United\\nStates, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Right now American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates\\nanywhere in the world.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: My economic team is developing historic tax reform\\nthat will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and\\nthrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We\\nmust create a level playing field for American companies and our workers\u2014\\nhave to do it.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other\\ncountries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign\\ncompanies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or\\nalmost nothing.]\\nI just met with officials and workers from a great American company,\\nHarley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent\\nmotorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.\\n[Laughter]\\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They\\nsaid that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other\\ncountries, mainly international sales? [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: They told me\u2014without even\\ncomplaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've\\nbecome used to it\u2014that it's very hard to do business with other countries\\nbecause they tax our goods at such a high rate. They weren't even asking\\nfor a change. But I am.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a\\nlong time since we had fair trade.] The first Republican President, Abraham\\nLincoln, warned that the \\\"abandonment of the protective policy by the\\nAmerican Government will produce want and ruin among our people.\\\"\\nLincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I am\\nnot going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken\\nadvantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No\\nlonger.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I am going to bring back millions of jobs.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Protecting our workers also means\\nreforming our system of legal immigration.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: The current, outdated system\\ndepresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on\\ntaxpayers.] Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many\\nothers, have a merit-based immigration system. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: It's a basic principle that\\nthose seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves\\nfinancially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very\\npublic resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: According to the\\nNational Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs\\nAmerican taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.]\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and\\ninstead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more\\nbenefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help\\nstruggling families\u2014including immigrant families\u2014enter the middle class.]\\nAnd they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.\\nI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we\\nfocus on the following goals: [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to\\nstrengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: If we\\nare guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans\\nand Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded\\nour country for decades.]\\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly\\ngreat national infrastructure program\u2014the building of the Interstate\\nHighway System. The time has come for a new program of national\\nrebuilding. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East;\\nall the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: With this $6 trillion,\\nwe could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we\\nhad people who had the ability to negotiate.] [Laughter]\\n\\nTo launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve\\nlegislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the\\nUnited States\u2014financed through both public and private capital\u2014creating\\nmillions of new jobs. This effort will be guided by two core principles: [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: buy\\nAmerican and hire American.]\\nTonight I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare\\nwith reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the\\nsame time, provide better health care.\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance\\nwas never the right solution for our country.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: The way to make health\\ninsurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and\\nthat is what we are going do.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple\\ndigits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State\\n\u2014the State of Kentucky\u2014and it's unsustainable and collapsing.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: One-third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them\\nfast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans\\nhave no choice at all. There's no choice left.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Remember when you were told\\nthat you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all\\nof those promises have been totally broken.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Obamacare is collapsing, and\\nwe must act decisively to protect all Americans.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Action is not a choice, it is a necessity.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: So I am calling on all Democrats and\\nRepublicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this\\nimploding Obamacare disaster.]\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to\\ncreate a better health care system for all Americans:\\nFirst, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have\\naccess to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans\\ncurrently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through\\nthe use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be\\nthe plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.\\nThirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility\\nthey need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\\nFourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and\\ndoctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and\\nwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down\\nimmediately. And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom\\nto purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly\\ncompetitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and\\nprovide far better care. So important.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be\\nsolved.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: And every hurting family can find healing and hope.]\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Our citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and\\nfinally get the job done, and get it done right?] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: On this and so many other\\nthings, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the\\ngood of our country and for the good of the American people.]\\nMy administration wants to work with members of both parties to make\\nchildcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they\\nhave paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean\\nair and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\\ndeserves a much brighter future.]\\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an\\ninspiration to us all.\\nToday is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery\\nis a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.\\nMegan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when\\nshe was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving\\nthis news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life\\nof his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped\\ndevelop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a\\nsophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a\\ndaughter. But [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and\\nDrug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved\\nMegan's life, from reaching those in need.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: If we slash the restraints, not just\\nat the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far\\nmore miracles just like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation\\nof miracles.]\\nBut to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every\\nAmerican child. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Education is the civil rights issue of our time.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I am calling\\nupon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school\\nchoice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and\\nLatino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private,\\ncharter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.]\\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha\\nMerriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third\\ngrade twice. But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning\\n\u2014great learning center\u2014with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship\\nprogram.\\nToday, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school,\\nbut from college. Later this year she will get her master's degree in social\\nwork. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like\\nDenisha.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\\nThe murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in\\nnearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last\\nyear alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This\\nis not acceptable in our society.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to\\nattend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: But to create\\nthis future, we must work with, not against\u2014not against\u2014the men and\\nwomen of law enforcement.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We must build bridges of cooperation and\\ntrust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is\u2014division. It's\\npure, unadulterated division. We have to unify.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and\\nneighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave\\nbehind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come\\nhome safe and sound.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We must support the incredible men and women of\\nlaw enforcement.]\\nAnd we must support the victims of crime. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: I have ordered the Department\\nof Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The\\noffice is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: We are\\nproviding a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and\\nsilenced by special interests.] Joining us in the audience tonight are four very\\nbrave Americans whose Government failed them. Their names are Jamiel\\nShaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant\\ngang member who had just been released from prison.] Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was\\nan incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to\\ngo to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\\nBut he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has\\nbecome a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy\\nSheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of\\nduty in California. They were pillars of their community. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: These brave men\\nwere viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record\\nand two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.]\\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that\\nyour father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire\\ncountry supporting you and praying for you.\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never\\nstop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We\\nwill always honor their memory.]\\n\\nFinally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the\\nUnited States military with the tools they need to prevent war. If they must,\\nthey have to fight and they only have to win.\\nI am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the\\ndefense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national\\ndefense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding\\nfor our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we\\nmust deliver for them.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even\\ngreater. And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for\\nAmerica in uniform.]\\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S.\\nNavy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \\\"Ryan\\\" Owens. Ryan died as he\\nlived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our\\nNation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed\\nthat\u2014and I quote\u2014\\\"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that\\ngenerated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more\\nvictories in the future against our enemy.\\\" Ryan's legacy is etched into\\neternity. Thank you. [Applause] And Ryan is looking down, right now\u2014you\\nknow that\u2014and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\\n[Laughter]\\nFor as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down\\none's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his\\ncountry, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.\\nTo those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no\\nfurther than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a\\ndirect, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American\\nleadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all\\nacross the globe.\\nWe strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two\\nworld wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated\\ncommunism.\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on\\nour very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In\\nfact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We expect our\\npartners\u2014whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific\u2014to take a\\ndirect and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and\\npay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.]\\nWe will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of\\nall nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Free\\nnations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people], and\\nAmerica respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: My job is\\nnot to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of\\nAmerica.]\\nBut we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.\\nWe must learn from the mistakes of the past. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We have seen the war and the\\ndestruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world\u2014all across\\nthe world.] The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in\\nmany cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely\\nreturn home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.\\nAmerica is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where\\nshared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\\nWe want peace, wherever peace can be found.\\nAmerica is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies,\\ndecades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.\\nThis history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\\nHopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful,\\nmore just, and more free.\\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to\\nPhiladelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the\\ncountry's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful\\ncreations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\\nRemington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at\\nelectric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric\\npen. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\\nThink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our\\npeople.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much\\nto hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets\\nwhere mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace,\\nand jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever\\nbefore\u2014for all Americans.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can\\nonly get there together. We are one people with one destiny. We all bleed\\nthe same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are\\nmade by the same God.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious\\nfreedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of\\nAmerican greatness began.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: The time for small thinking is over. The time for\\ntrivial fights is behind us.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We just need the courage to share the dreams\\nthat fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and\\nthe confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened\\nby our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and\\nguided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I am\\nasking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and\\ndaring things for our country.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I am asking everyone watching tonight to\\nseize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe,\\nonce more, in America.]\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.\\n\\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:09 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S.\\nCapitol.

It will be a big, big cut.\\nAt the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.] We\\nmust create a level playing field for American companies and our workers\u2014\\nhave to do it. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other\\ncountries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign\\ncompanies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or\\nalmost nothing.\\nI just met with officials and workers from a great American company,\\nHarley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent\\nmotorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.\\n[Laughter] And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, \\\"No, thank you.\\\"\\n[Laughter]\\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They\\nsaid that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other\\ncountries, mainly international sales? They told me\u2014without even\\ncomplaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've\\nbecome used to it\u2014that it's very hard to do business with other countries\\nbecause they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of\\nanother country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren't\\neven asking for a change. But I am.\\nI believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade.] It's been a\\nlong time since we had fair trade. The first Republican President, Abraham\\nLincoln, warned that the \\\"abandonment of the protective policy by the\\nAmerican Government will produce want and ruin among our people.\\\"\\nLincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. I am\\nnot going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken\\nadvantage of us any longer. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.] [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.] They have taken advantage of our country. No\\nlonger.\\nI am going to bring back millions of jobs. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I am going to bring back millions of jobs.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I am going to bring back millions of jobs.] Protecting our workers also means\\nreforming our system of legal immigration. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.] The current, outdated system\\ndepresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on\\ntaxpayers. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.] Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many\\nothers, have a merit-based immigration system. It's a basic principle that\\nthose seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves\\nfinancially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very\\npublic resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the\\nNational Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs\\nAmerican taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.]\\nSwitching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and\\ninstead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more\\nbenefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help\\nstruggling families\u2014including immigrant families\u2014enter the middle class.\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families\u2014including immigrant families\u2014enter the middle class.] And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.\\nI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we\\nfocus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to\\nstrengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws. If we\\nare guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans\\nand Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded\\nour country for decades.\\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly\\ngreat national infrastructure program\u2014the building of the Interstate\\nHighway System. The time has come for a new program of national\\nrebuilding. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.] America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East;\\nall the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: all the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: all the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: all the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.] With this $6 trillion,\\nwe could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we\\nhad people who had the ability to negotiate. [Laughter]\\nTo launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve\\nlegislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the\\nUnited States\u2014financed through both public and private capital\u2014creating\\nmillions of new jobs. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: creating millions of new jobs.] This effort will be guided by two core principles: buy\\nAmerican and hire American. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: buy American and hire American.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: buy American and hire American.]\\nTonight I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare\\nwith reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the\\nsame time, provide better health care.\\nMandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance\\nwas never the right solution for our country. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.] The way to make health\\ninsurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and\\nthat is what we are going do.\\nObamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple\\ndigits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.\\nGovernor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State\\n\u2014the State of Kentucky\u2014and it's unsustainable and collapsing.\\nOne-third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them\\nfast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans\\nhave no choice at all. There's no choice left. Remember when you were told\\nthat you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all\\nof those promises have been totally broken. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.] Obamacare is collapsing, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Obamacare is collapsing,] and\\nwe must act decisively to protect all Americans. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we must act decisively to protect all Americans.]\\nAction is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and\\nRepublicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this\\nimploding Obamacare disaster. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Action is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: imploding Obamacare disaster.]\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to\\ncreate a better health care system for all Americans:\\nFirst, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have\\naccess to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans\\ncurrently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through\\nthe use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be\\nthe plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.\\nThirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility\\nthey need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\\nFourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and\\ndoctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and\\nwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down\\nimmediately. And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom\\nto purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly\\ncompetitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and\\nprovide far better care. So important.\\nEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.] Every problem can be\\nsolved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: And every hurting family can find healing and hope.]\\nOur citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and\\nfinally get the job done, and get it done right? On this and so many other\\nthings, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the\\ngood of our country and for the good of the American people. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.]\\nMy administration wants to work with members of both parties to make\\nchildcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they\\nhave paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean\\nair and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\\nTrue love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\\ndeserves a much brighter future.\\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an\\ninspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery\\nis a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.\\nMegan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when\\nshe was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving\\nthis news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life\\nof his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped\\ndevelop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a\\nsophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a\\ndaughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and\\nDrug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved\\nMegan's life, from reaching those in need. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.] If we slash the restraints, not just\\nat the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far\\nmore miracles just like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation\\nof miracles.\\nBut to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every\\nAmerican child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling\\nupon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school\\nchoice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and\\nLatino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private,\\ncharter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.\\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha\\nMerriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third\\ngrade twice. But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning\\n\u2014great learning center\u2014with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship\\nprogram.\\nToday, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school,\\nbut from college. Later this year she will get her master's degree in social\\nwork. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like\\nDenisha.\\nBut to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\\nThe murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in\\nnearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last\\nyear alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This\\nis not acceptable in our society.\\nEvery American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to\\nattend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job. But to create\\nthis future, we must work with, not against\u2014not against\u2014the men and\\nwomen of law enforcement. We must build bridges of cooperation and\\ntrust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is\u2014division. It's\\npure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We have to unify.]\\nPolice and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and\\nneighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave\\nbehind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come\\nhome safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of\\nlaw enforcement.\\nAnd we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department\\nof Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The\\noffice is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.] We are\\nproviding a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and\\nsilenced by special interests. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.] Joining us in the audience tonight are four very\\nbrave Americans whose Government failed them. Their names are Jamiel\\nShaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\\nJamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant\\ngang member who had just been released from prison. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.] Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was\\nan incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to\\ngo to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\\nBut he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has\\nbecome a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy\\nSheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of\\nduty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men\\nwere viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record\\nand two prior deportations. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.] Should have never been in our country. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Should have never been in our country.]\\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that\\nyour father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire\\ncountry supporting you and praying for you.\\nTo Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never\\nstop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We\\nwill always honor their memory.\\nFinally, to keep America safe, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: to keep America safe,] we must provide the men and women of the\\nUnited States military with the tools they need to prevent war. If they must,\\nthey have to fight and they only have to win.\\nI am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the\\ndefense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national\\ndefense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding\\nfor our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we\\nmust deliver for them.\\nThe challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even\\ngreater. And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for\\nAmerica in uniform.\\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S.\\nNavy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \\\"Ryan\\\" Owens. Ryan died as he\\nlived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our\\nNation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed\\nthat\u2014and I quote\u2014\\\"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that\\ngenerated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more\\nvictories in the future against our enemy.\\\" Ryan's legacy is etched into\\neternity. Thank you. [Applause ] And Ryan is looking down, right now\u2014you\\nknow that\u2014and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\\n[Laughter]\\nFor as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down\\none's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his\\ncountry, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.\\nTo those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no\\nfurther than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a\\ndirect, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American\\nleadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all\\nacross the globe.\\nWe strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two\\nworld wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated\\ncommunism.\\nBut our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on\\nour very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\\nIn fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. We expect our\\npartners\u2014whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific\u2014to take a\\ndirect and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and\\npay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.\\nWe will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of\\nall nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also. Free\\nnations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people,] and\\nAmerica respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is\\nnot to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of\\nAmerica. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.] [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.]\\nBut we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.\\nWe must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the\\ndestruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world\u2014all across\\nthe world. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in\\nmany cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely\\nreturn home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.\\nAmerica is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where\\nshared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\\nWe want peace, wherever peace can be found.\\nAmerica is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies,\\ndecades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.\\nThis history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\\nHopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful,\\nmore just, and more free.\\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to\\nPhiladelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the\\ncountry's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful\\ncreations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\\nRemington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at\\nelectric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric\\npen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\\nThink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our\\npeople. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much\\nto hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets\\nwhere mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace,\\nand jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.\\nWhen we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever\\nbefore\u2014for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can\\nonly get there together. We are one people with one destiny. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We are one people with one destiny.] We all bleed\\nthe same blood. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We all bleed the same blood.] We all salute the same great American flag. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We all salute the same great American flag.] And we all are\\nmade by the same God. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: And we all are made by the same God.]\\nWhen we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious\\nfreedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of\\nAmerican greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for\\ntrivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams\\nthat fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and\\nthe confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.\\nFrom now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened\\nby our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and\\nguided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\\nI am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.] I am\\nasking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and\\ndaring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to\\nseize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe,\\nonce more, in America.\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

Recent threats targeting Jewish\\ncommunity centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last\\nweek's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation\\ndivided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate\\nand evil in all of its very ugly forms.

A new chapter of American greatness is now\\nbeginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.

Our\\nallies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the\\nworld\u2014friend or foe\u2014will find that America is strong, America is proud, and\\nAmerica is free.\\nIn 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our\\nfounding: 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be\\none of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will\\nAmerica look like as we reach our 250th year?

[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.] Solving these and so many other\\npressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It\\nwill require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every\\nchallenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our\\ngoals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American\\neconomy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United\\nStates, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.]\\nRight now American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates\\nanywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform\\nthat will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and\\nthrive anywhere and with anyone. It will be a big, big cut.\\nAt the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.] We\\nmust create a level playing field for American companies and our workers\u2014\\nhave to do it. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other\\ncountries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign\\ncompanies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or\\nalmost nothing.\\nI just met with officials and workers from a great American company,\\nHarley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent\\nmotorcycles, made in the U.S.A., on the front lawn of the White House.\\n[Laughter] And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, \\\"No, thank you.\\\"\\n[Laughter]\\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They\\nsaid that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other\\ncountries, mainly international sales? They told me\u2014without even\\ncomplaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've\\nbecome used to it\u2014that it's very hard to do business with other countries\\nbecause they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of\\nanother country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren't\\neven asking for a change. But I am.\\nI believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade.] It's been a\\nlong time since we had fair trade. The first Republican President, Abraham\\nLincoln, warned that the \\\"abandonment of the protective policy by the\\nAmerican Government will produce want and ruin among our people.\\\"\\nLincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. I am\\nnot going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken\\nadvantage of us any longer. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.] [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer.] They have taken advantage of our country. No\\nlonger.\\nI am going to bring back millions of jobs.

[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.] The current, outdated system\\ndepresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on\\ntaxpayers. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.] Nations around the world like Canada, Australia, and many\\nothers, have a merit-based immigration system. It's a basic principle that\\nthose seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves\\nfinancially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very\\npublic resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the\\nNational Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs\\nAmerican taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.]\\nSwitching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration, and\\ninstead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more\\nbenefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help\\nstruggling families\u2014including immigrant families\u2014enter the middle class.\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families\u2014including immigrant families\u2014enter the middle class.] And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.\\nI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we\\nfocus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to\\nstrengthen our Nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws. If we\\nare guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans\\nand Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded\\nour country for decades.\\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly\\ngreat national infrastructure program\u2014the building of the Interstate\\nHighway System. The time has come for a new program of national\\nrebuilding. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.] America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East;\\nall the while, our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

[Laughter]\\nTo launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve\\nlegislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the\\nUnited States\u2014financed through both public and private capital\u2014creating\\nmillions of new jobs.

[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: buy American and hire American.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: buy American and hire American.]\\nTonight I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare\\nwith reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the\\nsame time, provide better health care.\\nMandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance\\nwas never the right solution for our country. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Mandating every American to buy Government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.] The way to make health\\ninsurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and\\nthat is what we are going do.\\nObamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple\\ndigits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.\\nGovernor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State\\n\u2014the State of Kentucky\u2014and it's unsustainable and collapsing.\\nOne-third of the counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them\\nfast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans\\nhave no choice at all. There's no choice left. Remember when you were told\\nthat you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all\\nof those promises have been totally broken. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.] Obamacare is collapsing, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Obamacare is collapsing,] and\\nwe must act decisively to protect all Americans. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we must act decisively to protect all Americans.]\\nAction is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and\\nRepublicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this\\nimploding Obamacare disaster. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Action is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: imploding Obamacare disaster.]\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to\\ncreate a better health care system for all Americans:\\nFirst, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have\\naccess to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans\\ncurrently enrolled in the health care exchanges.\\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through\\nthe use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be\\nthe plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our Government.\\nThirdly, we should give our State Governors the resources and flexibility\\nthey need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\\nFourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and\\ndoctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and\\nwork to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down\\nimmediately. And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom\\nto purchase health insurance across State lines, which will create a truly\\ncompetitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and\\nprovide far better care. So important.\\nEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.] Every problem can be\\nsolved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: And every hurting family can find healing and hope.]\\nOur citizens deserve this and so much more, so why not join forces and\\nfinally get the job done, and get it done right? On this and so many other\\nthings, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the\\ngood of our country and for the good of the American people. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.]\\nMy administration wants to work with members of both parties to make\\nchildcare accessible and affordable; to help ensure new parents that they\\nhave paid family leave; to invest in women's health; and to promote clean\\nair and clean water; and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\\nTrue love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance\\nthe common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who\\ndeserves a much brighter future.\\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an\\ninspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery\\nis a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley.\\nMegan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when\\nshe was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving\\nthis news, Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life\\nof his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure and helped\\ndevelop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a\\nsophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a\\ndaughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and\\nDrug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved\\nMegan's life, from reaching those in need. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.] If we slash the restraints, not just\\nat the FDA, but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far\\nmore miracles just like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a nation\\nof miracles.\\nBut to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every\\nAmerican child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling\\nupon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school\\nchoice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and\\nLatino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private,\\ncharter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them.\\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha\\nMerriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third\\ngrade twice. But then, she was able to enroll in a private center for learning\\n\u2014great learning center\u2014with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship\\nprogram.\\nToday, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school,\\nbut from college. Later this year she will get her master's degree in social\\nwork. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like\\nDenisha.\\nBut to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\\nThe murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in\\nnearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last\\nyear alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This\\nis not acceptable in our society.\\nEvery American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to\\nattend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job. But to create\\nthis future, we must work with, not against\u2014not against\u2014the men and\\nwomen of law enforcement. We must build bridges of cooperation and\\ntrust, not drive the wedge of disunity, and really, it's what it is\u2014division. It's\\npure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We have to unify.]\\nPolice and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and\\nneighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave\\nbehind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come\\nhome safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of\\nlaw enforcement.\\nAnd we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department\\nof Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The\\noffice is called VOICE: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.] We are\\nproviding a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and\\nsilenced by special interests. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.] Joining us in the audience tonight are four very\\nbrave Americans whose Government failed them. Their names are Jamiel\\nShaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\\nJamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant\\ngang member who had just been released from prison. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.] Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was\\nan incredible young man, with unlimited potential, who was getting ready to\\ngo to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.\\nBut he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has\\nbecome a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you.\\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy\\nSheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of\\nduty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men\\nwere viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record\\nand two prior deportations. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.] Should have never been in our country. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Should have never been in our country.]\\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that\\nyour father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire\\ncountry supporting you and praying for you.\\nTo Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know that we will never\\nstop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We\\nwill always honor their memory.\\nFinally, to keep America safe, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: to keep America safe,] we must provide the men and women of the\\nUnited States military with the tools they need to prevent war. If they must,\\nthey have to fight and they only have to win.\\nI am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the\\ndefense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national\\ndefense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding\\nfor our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation, and now we\\nmust deliver for them.\\nThe challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even\\ngreater. And none are greater or are braver than those who fight for\\nAmerica in uniform.\\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S.\\nNavy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \\\"Ryan\\\" Owens. Ryan died as he\\nlived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our\\nNation. I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed\\nthat\u2014and I quote\u2014\\\"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that\\ngenerated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more\\nvictories in the future against our enemy.\\\" Ryan's legacy is etched into\\neternity. Thank you. [Applause ] And Ryan is looking down, right now\u2014you\\nknow that\u2014and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record.\\n[Laughter]\\nFor as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down\\none's life for one's friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his\\ncountry, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.\\nTo those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no\\nfurther than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a\\ndirect, robust, and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American\\nleadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all\\nacross the globe.\\nWe strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two\\nworld wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war, and defeated\\ncommunism.\\nBut our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on\\nour very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\\nIn fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. We expect our\\npartners\u2014whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific\u2014to take a\\ndirect and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and\\npay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.\\nWe will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of\\nall nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also. Free\\nnations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people,] and\\nAmerica respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is\\nnot to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of\\nAmerica. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.] [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.]\\nBut we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.\\nWe must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the\\ndestruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world\u2014all across\\nthe world. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in\\nmany cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely\\nreturn home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.\\nAmerica is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where\\nshared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\\nWe want peace, wherever peace can be found.\\nAmerica is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies,\\ndecades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.\\nThis history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\\nHopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful,\\nmore just, and more free.\\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to\\nPhiladelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the\\ncountry's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful\\ncreations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\\nRemington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at\\nelectric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric\\npen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\\nThink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our\\npeople. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much\\nto hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets\\nwhere mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace,\\nand jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.\\nWhen we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever\\nbefore\u2014for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can\\nonly get there together. We are one people with one destiny. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We are one people with one destiny.] We all bleed\\nthe same blood. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We all bleed the same blood.] We all salute the same great American flag. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We all salute the same great American flag.] And we all are\\nmade by the same God. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: And we all are made by the same God.]\\nWhen we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious\\nfreedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of\\nAmerican greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for\\ntrivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams\\nthat fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and\\nthe confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.\\nFrom now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened\\nby our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past; and\\nguided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\\nI am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.] I am\\nasking all Members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold, and\\ndaring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to\\nseize this moment. Believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe,\\nonce more, in America.\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

TRUMP\\nAddress to a Joint Session of Congress\\nFebruary 5, 2019\\n\\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the\\nFirst Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: Less than 1 year\\nhas passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic Chamber, to\\nspeak [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: on behalf of the American people] and to address [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams]. That night, our new administration had\\nalready taken very swift action. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: A new tide of optimism was already\\nsweeping across our land.] Each day since, we have gone forward with a\\nclear vision and a righteous mission: to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: make America great again] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: for all\\nAmericans].\\nOver the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved\\nextraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected and others\\nwe could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and\\nthe pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But\\nthrough it all, we have seen the [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: beauty of America's soul] and the [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: steel in\\nAmerica's spine].\\n\\nEach test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are and\\nshow us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to\\nthe rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a\\ntotally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a\\nhail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert,\\nwho is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of\\nthe first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey.\\nThrough 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and\\ndeep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank\\nyou very much.\\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He's here with us\\nalso. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped\\nat a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires. To\\neveryone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the\\nVirgin Islands\u2014everywhere\u2014we are with you, we love you, and [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: we always\\nwill pull through together, always]. Thank you to David and the brave people\\nof California. Thank you very much, David. Great job.\\nSome trials over the past year touched this Chamber very personally. With\\nus tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House, a guy\\nwho took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work 3\u00bd months later: the\\nlegend from Louisiana\u2014[laughter]\u2014Congressman Steve Scalise. [Applause ] I\\nthink they like you, Steve. [Laughter] We are incredibly grateful for the\\nheroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the\\ndoctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many\\nothers; some in this room. In the aftermath\u2014[applause ]\u2014yes. Yes.\\nIn the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: not as\\nRepublicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people]. But [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: it is\\nnot enough to come together only in times of tragedy]. Tonight I call upon [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: all\\nof us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to\\nsummon the unity we need to deliver for the people]. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: This is really the key.\\nThese are the people we were elected to serve.] [Applause ] Thank you. Over\\nthe last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: no people on\\nEarth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans]. If there is a\\nmountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there's a challenge,\\nwe tame it. If there's an opportunity, we seize it. So let's begin tonight by\\nrecognizing that the [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: state of our Union is strong because our people are\\nstrong]. And [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America].\\nSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000\\nnew jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: After years and\\nyears of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.] Unemployment\\nclaims have hit a 45-year low. And something I'm very proud of: African\\nAmerican unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And\\nHispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in\\nhistory.\\nSmall-business confidence is at an alltime high. The stock market has\\nsmashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion and more in value in\\njust this short period of time. The great news for Americans: 401(k),\\nretirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the\\nroof.\\nAnd just as [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I promised the American people] from this podium 11 months\\nago, we enacted the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history]. Our\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small\\nbusiness]. To lower tax rates for hard-working Americans, we nearly doubled\\nthe standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a\\nmarried couple is completely tax free. We also doubled the child tax credit.\\nA typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by\\n$2,000, slashing their tax bill in half. In April, this will be the last time you\\nwill ever file under the [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: old and very broken system], and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: millions of\\nAmericans will have more take-home pay starting next month\u2014a lot more].\\nWe eliminated an [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making\\nless than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply\\nbecause they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans]. We\\nrepealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is\\nnow gone, thank heavens. [Applause ] Great job.\\nWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21\\npercent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else\\nanywhere in the world. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: These changes alone are estimated to increase\\naverage family income by more than $4,000, a lot of money.] Small\\nbusinesses have also received a massive tax cut and can now deduct 20\\npercent of their business income.\\nHere tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing,\\na small, beautiful business in Ohio. They've just finished the best year in\\ntheir 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises,\\nhiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.\\nIt's a good feeling.\\nOne of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an\\nall-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job\\nduring the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained\\nto become a welder. Like many hard-working Americans, Corey plans to\\ninvest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education.\\nCorey, please stand. And he's a great welder. [Laughter] I was told that by\\nthe man that owns that company that's doing so well. So congratulations,\\nCorey.\\nSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax\\ncut bonuses, many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker.\\nAnd it's getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it\\nplans to invest a total of $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000\\nworkers. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion\\ninvestment in the United States\u2014just a little while ago.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better\\ntime to start living the American Dream.] So [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: to every citizen watching at\\nhome tonight, no matter where you've been or where you've come from, this\\nis your time]. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in\\nAmerica, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: together,\\nwe can achieve absolutely anything].\\nTonight I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have and\\nwhat kind of a nation we are going to be. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: All of us, together, as one team,\\none people, and one American family can do anything.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We all share the\\nsame home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great\\nAmerican flag.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Together, we are rediscovering the American way.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: In\\nAmerica, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy,\\nare the center of American life.] The motto is, \\\"In God We Trust.\\\" And we\\ncelebrate [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who\\ndeserve our total and unwavering support].\\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California,\\nwho noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans\\nDay. He decided all by himself to change that and started a movement that\\nhas now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston, a\\njob well done. Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic\\nduty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something\\nvery special, that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all\\nyou've done, Preston. Thank you very much.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us of\\nwhy we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge\\nof Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.]\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Americans love their country, and they deserve a Government that shows\\nthem the same love and loyalty in return.] For the last year, we have sought\\nto [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government].\\nWorking with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the\\nConstitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice and\\nmore circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our\\ncountry. We are totally defending our Second Amendment and have taken\\nhistoric actions to protect religious liberty.\\nAnd we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice\\nin their health care decisions. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed,\\nthe landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: my administration\\nhas already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our\\nveterans the care they deserve]. And we are hiring talented people who love\\nour vets as much as we do. And [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I will not stop until our veterans are\\nproperly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very\\nbeginning of this great journey].\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: All Americans deserve accountability and respect], and that's what we are\\ngiving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. So tonight [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: I call on\\nCongress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward\\ngood workers and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public\\ntrust or fail the American people].\\nIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more\\nregulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our\\ncountry. We have ended the [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: war on American energy], and we have ended\\nthe war on beautiful, clean coal. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We are now, very proudly, an exporter of\\nenergy to the world.] In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled\\nAmerica's great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City\\nrevving its engines again. And that's what's happening. Many car companies\\nare now building and expanding plants in the United States, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: something we\\nhaven't seen for decades. It's all coming back].\\nVery soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our\\ncountry. [CRISIS_RESToration_NARRATIVE: This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For\\nmany years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are\\nroaring back. They're coming back. They want to be where the action is.\\nThey want to be in the United States of America. That's where they want to\\nbe.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Exciting progress is happening every single day]. To speed access to\\nbreakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year, the FDA\\napproved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever\\nbefore in our country's history. We also believe that patients with terminal\\nconditions and terminal illness should have access to experimental\\ntreatment immediately that could potentially save their lives. People who\\nare terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a\\ncure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It's time for Congress\\nto give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. [Applause ]\\nRight?\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.\\nIn many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the\\nUnited States. And it's very, very unfair.] That is why I have directed my\\nadministration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top\\npriorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially. Watch.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals\\nthat sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs,\\nand our wealth]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we're getting it back so\\nfast. The era of economic surrender is totally over.] From now on, we expect\\ntrading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal.\\nWe will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they'll be\\ngood ones, but they'll be fair. And we will protect [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: American workers and\\nAmerican intellectual property] through strong enforcement of our trade\\nrules.\\nAs we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: our crumbling\\ninfrastructure]. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: America is a nation of builders.] We built the Empire State\\nBuilding in just 1 year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to\\nget a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: I am asking\\nboth parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern\\ninfrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve].\\nTonight I'm calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5\\ntrillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so\\ndesperately needs. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering\\nwith State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into\\nprivate sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.] And\\nwe can do it.\\nAny bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it\\ndown to no more than 2 years and perhaps even 1. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Together, we can\\nreclaim our great building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads,\\nbridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land.] And [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: we will\\ndo it with American heart and American hands and American grit.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We want\\nevery American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every\\nchild to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be\\nproud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from\\nwelfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to\\nprosperity.]\\nAs tax cuts create new jobs, let's invest in workforce development, and let's\\ninvest in job training, which we need so badly. Let's open great vocational\\nschools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full\\npotential. And let's support working families by supporting paid family\\nleave.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As America regains its strength], opportunity must be extended to all\\ncitizens. That is why this year, we will embark on reforming our prisons to\\nhelp former inmates, who have served their time, get a second chance at\\nlife.\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be\\nhelped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American\\nworkers and American families.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: For decades, open borders have allowed\\ndrugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've\\nallowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages\\nagainst the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of\\nmany innocent lives.]\\nHere tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy\\nCuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage\\ndaughters\u2014Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens\u2014were close friends on Long\\nIsland. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th birthday\u2014such a\\nhappy time it should have been\u2014neither of them came home. These two\\nprecious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their\\nhometown.\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and\\nNisa's murders.] Many of these gang members took advantage of [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: glaring\\nloopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien\\nminors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school]. Evelyn, Elizabeth,\\nFreddy, and Robert: Tonight everyone in this chamber is praying for you.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Everyone in America is grieving for you.] Please stand. Thank you very much.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you.\\nWe love you. Thank you.]\\nWhile we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make\\nsure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain. Tonight [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I am\\ncalling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed\\nMS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country.] We have\\nproposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our\\nICE and Border Patrol agents\u2014these are great people; these are great,\\ngreat people\u2014that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this\\ncan never happen again.\\nThe United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do\\nmore than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the\\nstruggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: as President of\\nthe United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant\\nconcern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and\\nAmerica's forgotten communities]. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I want our youth to grow up to achieve\\ngreat things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.]\\nSo tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both\\nparties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every\\nbackground, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of\\nevery elected official in this Chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect\\ntheir safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the\\nAmerican Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one\\nleader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations\\nSpecial Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by \\\"D.J.\\\" and \\\"C.J.\\\" He said, \\\"Call\\nme either one.\\\" [Laughter] So we'll call you \\\"C.J.\\\" [Laughter] Served 15 years\\nin the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15\\nyears fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our\\nstreets. Tough job.\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered C.J.'s murder.] And they wanted it to\\nhappen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he\\ncommanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His\\nteam has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang\\nmembers. And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done,\\nwe have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible\\npeople out of this country or into our prisons. So I just want to congratulate\\nyou, C.J. You're a brave guy. Thank you very much.\\nAnd I asked C.J., \\\"What's the secret?\\\" He said, \\\"We're just tougher than they\\nare.\\\" And I like that answer. [Laughter] Now, let's get Congress to send you\\n\u2014and all of the people in this great Chamber have to do it; we have no\\nchoice. C.J., we're going to send you reinforcements, and we're going to\\nsend them to you quickly. It's what you need.\\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an\\nimmigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met\\nextensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan\\napproach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented\\nCongress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties\\nas a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but\\nwhere our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.\\nHere are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework\\ngenerously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who\\nwere brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost\\nthree times more people than the previous administration covered. Under\\nour plan, those who meet education and work requirements and show\\ngood moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United\\nStates over a 12-year period.\\nThe second pillar [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: fully secures the border]. That means [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: building a great wall\\non the southern border], and it means hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep\\nour communities safe. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes\\nexploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country], and it finally ends\\nthe horrible and dangerous practice of catch-and-release.\\nThe third pillar [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out\\ngreen cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American\\npeople]. It's time to begin moving toward a merit-based immigration system,\\none that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will\\ncontribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.\\nThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain\\nmigration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring\\nin virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus\\non the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor\\nchildren. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for\\nour security and for the future of America].\\n[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible\\nby the visa lottery and chain migration]. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: In the age of terrorism, these programs\\npresent risks we can just no longer afford]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: It's time to reform these\\noutdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into\\nthe 21st century.] These four pillars represent a down-the-middle\\ncompromise and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful\\nimmigration system. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to\\nsolve this problem]. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it\\nhappen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that\\nfulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first. So let's come\\ntogether, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.\\nThese reforms will also support our response to the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: terrible crisis of opioid\\nand drug addiction]. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We\\nhave to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug\\noverdoses: 174 deaths per day, 7 per hour. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: We must get much tougher on\\ndrug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this\\nscourge.]\\nMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping\\nget treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt.\\nThe struggle will be long, and it will be difficult, but [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: as Americans always do,\\nin the end, we will succeed. We will prevail].\\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in\\nAmerica. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets\\nfamily of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the\\nAlbuquerque Police Department. He's here tonight with his wife Rebecca.\\nThank you, Ryan.\\nLast year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman\\npreparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her\\nunborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn't know where to\\nturn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \\\"You will do it, because\\nyou can.\\\" He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their\\nfour kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she\\nagreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and\\nRebecca, you embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you. Thank you,\\nRyan and Rebecca.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also\\nrestoring our strength and standing abroad.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Around the world, we face\\nrogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that\\nchallenge our interests, our economy, and our values.] In confronting these\\nhorrible dangers, we know that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: weakness is the surest path to conflict and\\nunmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense].\\nFor this reason, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense\\nsequester and fully fund our great military.] As part of our defense, we must\\nmodernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully, never having to use\\nit, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of\\naggression by any other nation or anyone else. Perhaps someday in the\\nfuture, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will\\nget together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not\\nthere yet, sadly.\\nLast year, [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish\\nISIS from the face of the Earth]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: One year later, I am proud to report that the\\ncoalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the\\nterritory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other\\nlocations as well.] But there is much more work to be done. We will continue\\nour fight until ISIS is defeated.\\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November,\\nJustin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission\\nto clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could\\nreturn to that city, hopefully, soon and, hopefully, safely.\\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely\\nwounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-\\ntrapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found\\nKenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and\\ninserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight\\nminutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration\\nthrough 2\u00bd hours and through emergency surgery.\\nKenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless love for his\\nfellow warrior. Tonight Kenton is recovering in Texas, Raqqa is liberated,\\nand Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \\\"V\\\" for valor. Staff Sergeant\\nPeck, all of America salutes you.\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When\\npossible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we\\nmust be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists\\nare not merely criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants.] And when\\ncaptured overseas, [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: they should be treated like the terrorists they are].\\nIn the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of\\ndangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield, including\\nthe ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we\\nreleased. So today I'm keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to\\nwalking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis\u2014who is doing a great job,\\nthank you\u2014to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open\\nthe detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: I am asking Congress to ensure\\nthat, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaida, we continue to have all necessary\\npower to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we\\nfind them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.]\\nAt the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have\\nnew rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our\\nmilitary is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer\\ntell our enemies our plans.\\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate\\njust months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly\\nafterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General\\nAssembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision. In 2016,\\nAmerican taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20\\nbillion in aid. That is why tonight [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I am asking Congress to pass legislation to\\nhelp ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American\\ninterests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America].\\nAs we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring\\nclarity about our adversaries. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: When the people of Iran rose up against the\\ncrimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: America stands\\nwith the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: I am\\nasking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran\\nnuclear deal]. My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the\\ncommunist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\\nBut [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than\\nthe cruel dictatorship in North Korea]. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: North Korea's reckless pursuit of\\nnuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We are waging a\\ncampaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Past\\nexperience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite\\naggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past\\nadministrations that got us into this very dangerous position.] We need only\\nlook at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand\\nthe nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.\\nOtto Warmbier was a hard-working student at the University of Virginia, and\\na great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a\\ntour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was\\narrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial,\\nthe dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning\\nhim to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He\\npassed away just days after his return.\\nOtto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us\\ntonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please.\\nIncredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens\\nour world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much.\\nThank you. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Tonight we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American\\nresolve.] Thank you.\\nFinally\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. We are joined by one more witness to the\\nominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Sung-ho. In 1996, Sung-ho\\nwas a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a\\nrailroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get.\\nIn the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.\\nHe woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple\\namputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and\\nsister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt\\nthemselves, permanently stunting their own growth.\\nLater, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a\\nbrief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any\\nChristians. He had, and he resolved, after that, to be free. Sung-ho traveled\\nthousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to\\nfreedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape\\nand was tortured to death.\\nToday, he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts\\ninto North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth. Today, he has a\\nnew leg. But, Sung-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a\\nreminder of how far you've come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us\\nall. Please. Thank you. Sung-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of\\nevery human soul to live in freedom.\\nIt was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth\\nto a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught\\nbetween a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible\\npeople with a revolutionary idea: [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: that they could rule themselves; that they\\ncould chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the\\nentire world].\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans\\nhave always stood for, always strived for, and always done.] Atop the dome\\nof this Capitol stands the statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified\\namong the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to\\nprotect her: monuments to Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and King.\\nMemorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans\\nwho shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond;\\nand others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all\\nover Asia. And Freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This\\nCapitol\u2014this living monument\u2014this is the monument to the American\\npeople.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. We're a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all\\naround us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.\\nThey work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our\\nchildren at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms\\nand brave kids. They are firefighters and police officers and border agents,\\nmedics and marines. But [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: above all else, they are Americans]. And this\\nCapitol, this city, this Nation, belongs entirely to them. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Our task is to respect\\nthem, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be\\nworthy of them].\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of\\nscience and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never,\\never forget: The people dreamed this country, the people built this country,\\nand it's the people who are making America great again!]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is\\nnothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values,\\nfaith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail. Our families will\\nthrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and\\nstrong and proud and mighty and free.]\\nThank you. And God bless America. Goodnight.\\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:10 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S.\\nCapitol. In his remarks, he referred to Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil M.\\nGorsuch; Alexi Saenz, Jairo Saenz, Selvin Chavez, and Enrique Portillo, who,\\nalong with two unnamed minors, are accused in the murder of Brentwood, NY,\\nresidents Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens in Brentwood on September 13, 2016;\\nCrystal Champ, birth mother of Hope Holets; and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader\\nof the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization.\\nThank you.

TRUMP\\nAddress to a Joint Session of Congress\\nFebruary 5, 2019\\n\\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the\\nFirst Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: Less than 1 year\\nhas passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic Chamber, to\\nspeak [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: on behalf of the American people] and to address [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams]. That night, our new administration had\\nalready taken very swift action. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: A new tide of optimism was already\\nsweeping across our land.] Each day since, we have gone forward with a\\nclear vision and a righteous mission: to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: make America great again] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: for all\\nAmericans].\\nOver the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved\\nextraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected and others\\nwe could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and\\nthe pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But\\nthrough it all, we have seen the [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: beauty of America's soul] and the [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: steel in\\nAmerica's spine].\\n\\nEach test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are and\\nshow us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to\\nthe rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a\\ntotally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a\\nhail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert,\\nwho is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of\\nthe first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey.\\nThrough 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and\\ndeep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank\\nyou very much.\\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He's here with us\\nalso. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped\\nat a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires. To\\neveryone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the\\nVirgin Islands\u2014everywhere\u2014we are with you, we love you, and [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: we always\\nwill pull through together, always]. Thank you to David and the brave people\\nof California. Thank you very much, David. Great job.\\nSome trials over the past year touched this Chamber very personally. With\\nus tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House, a guy\\nwho took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work 3\u00bd months later: the\\nlegend from Louisiana\u2014[laughter]\u2014Congressman Steve Scalise. [Applause ] I\\nthink they like you, Steve. [Laughter] We are incredibly grateful for the\\nheroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the\\ndoctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many\\nothers; some in this room. In the aftermath\u2014[applause ]\u2014yes. Yes.\\nIn the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: not as\\nRepublicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people]. But [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: it is\\nnot enough to come together only in times of tragedy]. Tonight I call upon [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: all\\nof us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to\\nsummon the unity we need to deliver for the people]. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: This is really the key.\\nThese are the people we were elected to serve.] [Applause ] Thank you. Over\\nthe last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: no people on\\nEarth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans]. If there is a\\nmountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there's a challenge,\\nwe tame it. If there's an opportunity, we seize it. So let's begin tonight by\\nrecognizing that the [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: state of our Union is strong because our people are\\nstrong]. And [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America].\\nSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000\\nnew jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: After years and\\nyears of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.] Unemployment\\nclaims have hit a 45-year low. And something I'm very proud of: African\\nAmerican unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And\\nHispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in\\nhistory.\\nSmall-business confidence is at an alltime high. The stock market has\\nsmashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion and more in value in\\njust this short period of time. The great news for Americans: 401(k),\\nretirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the\\nroof.\\nAnd just as [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I promised the American people] from this podium 11 months\\nago, we enacted the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history]. Our\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small\\nbusiness]. To lower tax rates for hard-working Americans, we nearly doubled\\nthe standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a\\nmarried couple is completely tax free. We also doubled the child tax credit.\\nA typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by\\n$2,000, slashing their tax bill in half. In April, this will be the last time you\\nwill ever file under the [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: old and very broken system], and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: millions of\\nAmericans will have more take-home pay starting next month\u2014a lot more].\\nWe eliminated an [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making\\nless than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply\\nbecause they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans]. We\\nrepealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is\\nnow gone, thank heavens. [Applause ] Great job.\\nWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21\\npercent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else\\nanywhere in the world. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: These changes alone are estimated to increase\\naverage family income by more than $4,000, a lot of money.] Small\\nbusinesses have also received a massive tax cut and can now deduct 20\\npercent of their business income.\\nHere tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing,\\na small, beautiful business in Ohio. They've just finished the best year in\\ntheir 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises,\\nhiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.\\nIt's a good feeling.\\nOne of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an\\nall-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job\\nduring the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained\\nto become a welder. Like many hard-working Americans, Corey plans to\\ninvest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education.\\nCorey, please stand. And he's a great welder. [Laughter] I was told that by\\nthe man that owns that company that's doing so well. So congratulations,\\nCorey.\\nSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax\\ncut bonuses, many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker.\\nAnd it's getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it\\nplans to invest a total of $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000\\nworkers. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion\\ninvestment in the United States\u2014just a little while ago.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better\\ntime to start living the American Dream.] So [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: to every citizen watching at\\nhome tonight, no matter where you've been or where you've come from, this\\nis your time]. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in\\nAmerica, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: together,\\nwe can achieve absolutely anything].\\nTonight I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have and\\nwhat kind of a nation we are going to be. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: All of us, together, as one team,\\none people, and one American family can do anything.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We all share the\\nsame home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great\\nAmerican flag.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Together, we are rediscovering the American way.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: In\\nAmerica, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy,\\nare the center of American life.] The motto is, \\\"In God We Trust.\\\" And we\\ncelebrate [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who\\ndeserve our total and unwavering support].\\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California,\\nwho noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans\\nDay. He decided all by himself to change that and started a movement that\\nhas now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston, a\\njob well done. Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic\\nduty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something\\nvery special, that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all\\nyou've done, Preston. Thank you very much.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us of\\nwhy we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge\\nof Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.]\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Americans love their country, and they deserve a Government that shows\\nthem the same love and loyalty in return.] For the last year, we have sought\\nto [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government].\\nWorking with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the\\nConstitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice and\\nmore circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our\\ncountry. We are totally defending our Second Amendment and have taken\\nhistoric actions to protect religious liberty.\\nAnd we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice\\nin their health care decisions. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed,\\nthe landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: my administration\\nhas already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our\\nveterans the care they deserve]. And we are hiring talented people who love\\nour vets as much as we do. And [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I will not stop until our veterans are\\nproperly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very\\nbeginning of this great journey].\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: All Americans deserve accountability and respect], and that's what we are\\ngiving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. So tonight [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: I call on\\nCongress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward\\ngood workers and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public\\ntrust or fail the American people].\\nIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more\\nregulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our\\ncountry. We have ended the [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: war on American energy], and we have ended\\nthe war on beautiful, clean coal. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We are now, very proudly, an exporter of\\nenergy to the world.] In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled\\nAmerica's great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City\\nrevving its engines again. And that's what's happening. Many car companies\\nare now building and expanding plants in the United States, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: something we\\nhaven't seen for decades. It's all coming back].\\nVery soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our\\ncountry. [CRISIS_RESToration_NARRATIVE: This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For\\nmany years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are\\nroaring back. They're coming back. They want to be where the action is.\\nThey want to be in the United States of America. That's where they want to\\nbe.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Exciting progress is happening every single day]. To speed access to\\nbreakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year, the FDA\\napproved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever\\nbefore in our country's history. We also believe that patients with terminal\\nconditions and terminal illness should have access to experimental\\ntreatment immediately that could potentially save their lives. People who\\nare terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a\\ncure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It's time for Congress\\nto give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. [Applause ]\\nRight?\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.\\nIn many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the\\nUnited States. And it's very, very unfair.] That is why I have directed my\\nadministration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top\\npriorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially. Watch.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals\\nthat sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs,\\nand our wealth]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we're getting it back so\\nfast. The era of economic surrender is totally over.] From now on, we expect\\ntrading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal.\\nWe will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they'll be\\ngood ones, but they'll be fair. And we will protect [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: American workers and\\nAmerican intellectual property] through strong enforcement of our trade\\nrules.\\nAs we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: our crumbling\\ninfrastructure]. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: America is a nation of builders.] We built the Empire State\\nBuilding in just 1 year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to\\nget a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: I am asking\\nboth parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern\\ninfrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve].\\nTonight I'm calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5\\ntrillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so\\ndesperately needs. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering\\nwith State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into\\nprivate sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.] And\\nwe can do it.\\nAny bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it\\ndown to no more than 2 years and perhaps even 1. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Together, we can\\nreclaim our great building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads,\\nbridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land.] And [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: we will\\ndo it with American heart and American hands and American grit.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We want\\nevery American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every\\nchild to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be\\nproud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from\\nwelfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to\\nprosperity.]\\nAs tax cuts create new jobs, let's invest in workforce development, and let's\\ninvest in job training, which we need so badly. Let's open great vocational\\nschools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full\\npotential. And let's support working families by supporting paid family\\nleave.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As America regains its strength], opportunity must be extended to all\\ncitizens. That is why this year, we will embark on reforming our prisons to\\nhelp former inmates, who have served their time, get a second chance at\\nlife.\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be\\nhelped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American\\nworkers and American families.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: For decades, open borders have allowed\\ndrugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've\\nallowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages\\nagainst the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of\\nmany innocent lives.]\\nHere tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy\\nCuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage\\ndaughters\u2014Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens\u2014were close friends on Long\\nIsland. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th birthday\u2014such a\\nhappy time it should have been\u2014neither of them came home. These two\\nprecious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their\\nhometown.\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and\\nNisa's murders.] Many of these gang members took advantage of [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: glaring\\nloopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien\\nminors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school]. Evelyn, Elizabeth,\\nFreddy, and Robert: Tonight everyone in this chamber is praying for you.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Everyone in America is grieving for you.] Please stand. Thank you very much.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you.\\nWe love you. Thank you.]\\nWhile we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make\\nsure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain. Tonight [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I am\\ncalling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed\\nMS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country.] We have\\nproposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our\\nICE and Border Patrol agents\u2014these are great people; these are great,\\ngreat people\u2014that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this\\ncan never happen again.\\nThe United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do\\nmore than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the\\nstruggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: as President of\\nthe United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant\\nconcern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and\\nAmerica's forgotten communities]. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I want our youth to grow up to achieve\\ngreat things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.]\\nSo tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both\\nparties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every\\nbackground, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of\\nevery elected official in this Chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect\\ntheir safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the\\nAmerican Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one\\nleader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations\\nSpecial Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by \\\"D.J.\\\" and \\\"C.J.\\\" He said, \\\"Call\\nme either one.\\\" [Laughter] So we'll call you \\\"C.J.\\\" [Laughter] Served 15 years\\nin the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15\\nyears fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our\\nstreets. Tough job.\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered C.J.'s murder.] And they wanted it to\\nhappen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he\\ncommanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His\\nteam has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang\\nmembers. And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done,\\nwe have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible\\npeople out of this country or into our prisons. So I just want to congratulate\\nyou, C.J. You're a brave guy. Thank you very much.\\nAnd I asked C.J., \\\"What's the secret?\\\" He said, \\\"We're just tougher than they\\nare.\\\" And I like that answer. [Laughter] Now, let's get Congress to send you\\n\u2014and all of the people in this great Chamber have to do it; we have no\\nchoice. C.J., we're going to send you reinforcements, and we're going to\\nsend them to you quickly. It's what you need.\\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an\\nimmigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met\\nextensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan\\napproach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented\\nCongress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties\\nas a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but\\nwhere our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.\\nHere are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework\\ngenerously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who\\nwere brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost\\nthree times more people than the previous administration covered. Under\\nour plan, those who meet education and work requirements and show\\ngood moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United\\nStates over a 12-year period.\\nThe second pillar [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: fully secures the border]. That means [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: building a great wall\\non the southern border], and it means hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep\\nour communities safe. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes\\nexploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country], and it finally ends\\nthe horrible and dangerous practice of catch-and-release.\\nThe third pillar [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out\\ngreen cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American\\npeople]. It's time to begin moving toward a merit-based immigration system,\\none that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will\\ncontribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.\\nThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain\\nmigration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring\\nin virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus\\non the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor\\nchildren. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for\\nour security and for the future of America].\\n[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible\\nby the visa lottery and chain migration]. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: In the age of terrorism, these programs\\npresent risks we can just no longer afford]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: It's time to reform these\\noutdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into\\nthe 21st century.] These four pillars represent a down-the-middle\\ncompromise and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful\\nimmigration system. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to\\nsolve this problem]. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it\\nhappen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that\\nfulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first. So let's come\\ntogether, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.\\nThese reforms will also support our response to the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: terrible crisis of opioid\\nand drug addiction]. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We\\nhave to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug\\noverdoses: 174 deaths per day, 7 per hour. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: We must get much tougher on\\ndrug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this\\nscourge.]\\nMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping\\nget treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt.\\nThe struggle will be long, and it will be difficult, but [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: as Americans always do,\\nin the end, we will succeed. We will prevail].\\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in\\nAmerica. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets\\nfamily of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the\\nAlbuquerque Police Department. He's here tonight with his wife Rebecca.\\nThank you, Ryan.\\nLast year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman\\npreparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her\\nunborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn't know where to\\nturn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \\\"You will do it, because\\nyou can.\\\" He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their\\nfour kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she\\nagreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and\\nRebecca, you embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you. Thank you,\\nRyan and Rebecca.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also\\nrestoring our strength and standing abroad.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Around the world, we face\\nrogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that\\nchallenge our interests, our economy, and our values.] In confronting these\\nhorrible dangers, we know that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: weakness is the surest path to conflict and\\nunmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense].\\nFor this reason, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense\\nsequester and fully fund our great military.] As part of our defense, we must\\nmodernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully, never having to use\\nit, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of\\naggression by any other nation or anyone else. Perhaps someday in the\\nfuture, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will\\nget together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not\\nthere yet, sadly.\\nLast year, [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish\\nISIS from the face of the Earth]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: One year later, I am proud to report that the\\ncoalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the\\nterritory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other\\nlocations as well.] But there is much more work to be done. We will continue\\nour fight until ISIS is defeated.\\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November,\\nJustin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission\\nto clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could\\nreturn to that city, hopefully, soon and, hopefully, safely.\\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely\\nwounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-\\ntrapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found\\nKenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and\\ninserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight\\nminutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration\\nthrough 2\u00bd hours and through emergency surgery.\\nKenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless love for his\\nfellow warrior. Tonight Kenton is recovering in Texas, Raqqa is liberated,\\nand Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \\\"V\\\" for valor. Staff Sergeant\\nPeck, all of America salutes you.\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When\\npossible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we\\nmust be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists\\nare not merely criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants.] And when\\ncaptured overseas, [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: they should be treated like the terrorists they are].\\nIn the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of\\ndangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield, including\\nthe ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we\\nreleased. So today I'm keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to\\nwalking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis\u2014who is doing a great job,\\nthank you\u2014to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open\\nthe detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: I am asking Congress to ensure\\nthat, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaida, we continue to have all necessary\\npower to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we\\nfind them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.]\\nAt the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have\\nnew rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our\\nmilitary is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer\\ntell our enemies our plans.\\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate\\njust months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly\\nafterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General\\nAssembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision. In 2016,\\nAmerican taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20\\nbillion in aid. That is why tonight [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I am asking Congress to pass legislation to\\nhelp ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American\\ninterests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America].\\nAs we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring\\nclarity about our adversaries. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: When the people of Iran rose up against the\\ncrimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: America stands\\nwith the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: I am\\nasking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran\\nnuclear deal]. My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the\\ncommunist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\\nBut [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than\\nthe cruel dictatorship in North Korea]. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: North Korea's reckless pursuit of\\nnuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We are waging a\\ncampaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Past\\nexperience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite\\naggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past\\nadministrations that got us into this very dangerous position.] We need only\\nlook at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand\\nthe nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.\\nOtto Warmbier was a hard-working student at the University of Virginia, and\\na great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a\\ntour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was\\narrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial,\\nthe dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning\\nhim to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He\\npassed away just days after his return.\\nOtto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us\\ntonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please.\\nIncredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens\\nour world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much.\\nThank you. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Tonight we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American\\nresolve.] Thank you.\\nFinally\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. We are joined by one more witness to the\\nominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Sung-ho. In 1996, Sung-ho\\nwas a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a\\nrailroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get.\\nIn the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.\\nHe woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple\\namputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and\\nsister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt\\nthemselves, permanently stunting their own growth.\\nLater, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a\\nbrief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any\\nChristians. He had, and he resolved, after that, to be free. Sung-ho traveled\\nthousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to\\nfreedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape\\nand was tortured to death.\\nToday, he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts\\ninto North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth. Today, he has a\\nnew leg. But, Sung-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a\\nreminder of how far you've come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us\\nall. Please. Thank you. Sung-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of\\nevery human soul to live in freedom.\\nIt was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth\\nto a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught\\nbetween a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible\\npeople with a revolutionary idea: [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: that they could rule themselves; that they\\ncould chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the\\nentire world].\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans\\nhave always stood for, always strived for, and always done.] Atop the dome\\nof this Capitol stands the statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified\\namong the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to\\nprotect her: monuments to Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and King.\\nMemorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans\\nwho shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond;\\nand others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all\\nover Asia. And Freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This\\nCapitol\u2014this living monument\u2014this is the monument to the American\\npeople.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. We're a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all\\naround us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.\\nThey work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our\\nchildren at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms\\nand brave kids. They are firefighters and police officers and border agents,\\nmedics and marines. But [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: above all else, they are Americans]. And this\\nCapitol, this city, this Nation, belongs entirely to them. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Our task is to respect\\nthem, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be\\nworthy of them].\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of\\nscience and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never,\\never forget: The people dreamed this country, the people built this country,\\nand it's the people who are making America great again!]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is\\nnothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values,\\nfaith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail. Our families will\\nthrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and\\nstrong and proud and mighty and free.]\\nThank you. And God bless America. Goodnight.\\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:10 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S.\\nCapitol. In his remarks, he referred to Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil M.\\nGorsuch; Alexi Saenz, Jairo Saenz, Selvin Chavez, and Enrique Portillo, who,\\nalong with two unnamed minors, are accused in the murder of Brentwood, NY,\\nresidents Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens in Brentwood on September 13, 2016;\\nCrystal Champ, birth mother of Hope Holets; and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader\\nof the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization.\\nThank you.

An [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: economic miracle is taking\\nplace in the United States], and [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: the only thing that can stop it are foolish\\nwars, politics, or ridiculous, partisan investigations]. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: If there is going to be\\npeace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation]. [Laughter] It\\njust doesn't work that way.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad]. This new era\\nof cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly\\nqualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, in some cases,\\nyears and years waiting. Not right. The Senate has failed to act on these\\nnominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our\\ncountry. Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have\\nalready proven that that's possible. In the last Congress, both parties came\\ntogether to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a\\nsweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms. And after four decades of\\nrejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate\\nthose who mistreat our wonderful veterans.\\nAnd just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice\\nreform. They said it couldn't be done. Last year, I heard, through friends,\\nthe story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced\\nto life in prison as a first-time nonviolent drug offender. Over the next 22\\nyears, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better\\npath. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.\\nAlice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in\\ncriminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice. She served\\nalmost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of\\nher life.\\nIn June, I commuted Alice's sentence. When I saw Alice's beautiful family\\ngreet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I\\nknew I did something right. Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific\\nwoman. Terrific. Alice, please. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we\\nalways have the power to shape our own destiny. Thank you very much,\\nAlice. Thank you very much.\\nInspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with\\nmembers of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. Big deal. It's a\\nbig deal. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and\\ndisproportionately harmed the African American community. The First Step\\nAct gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive,\\nlaw-abiding citizens.\\nAmerica is a nation that believes in redemption.\\nWe are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at\\nthe age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and\\nrelated offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30\\nBible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow\\ninmates. Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison\\nunder the First Step Act. Matthew, please. Thank you, Matthew. Welcome\\nhome.\\nNow Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: urgent national crisis]. Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund\\nour Government, protect our homeland, and [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: secure our very dangerous\\nsouthern border]. Now is the time for Congress to show the world that\\nAmerica is committed to [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: ending illegal immigration] and putting the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: ruthless\\ncoyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business].\\nAs we speak, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: large, organized caravans are on the march to the United\\nStates]. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal\\nimmigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring\\nthem up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I\\nhave ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: this tremendous onslaught].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to\\nthe safety, security, and financial well-being of all America]. We have a moral\\nduty to create an immigration system that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: protects the lives and jobs of our\\ncitizens]. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living\\nhere today who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal\\nimmigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.\\nI want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but\\nthey have to come in legally. Tonight I am asking you to defend our very\\ndangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens\\nand to our country. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: No issue better illustrates the divide between America's\\nworking class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy\\npoliticians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind\\nwalls and gates and guards.]\\nMeanwhile, [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal\\nimmigration: reduced jobs, lower wages], overburdened schools, hospitals\\nthat are so crowded you can't get in, increased crime, and a depleted social\\nsafety net. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is\\nactually very cruel].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and\\ngain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take\\nadvantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle\\nthousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them\\ninto prostitution and modern-day slavery].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that\\ncross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine,\\nand fentanyl].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American\\nStates, and they almost all come through our southern border]. Just\\nyesterday an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal\\nshooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these\\ngang members by the thousands. But until we secure our border, they're\\ngoing to keep streaming right back in.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens].\\nI've gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads and families. No\\none should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to\\nendure.\\nHere tonight is Debra Bissell. Just 3 weeks ago, Debra's parents Gerald and\\nSharon were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by\\nan illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11\\ngrandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald\\nand Sharon's granddaughter Heather and great-granddaughter Madison.\\nTo Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand. Few can understand your pain.\\nThank you. And thank you for being here. Thank you very much. I will never\\nforget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should\\nnever happen again. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Not one more American life should be lost because\\nour Nation failed to control its very dangerous border].\\nIn the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal\\naliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults,\\n30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders. We are joined tonight by\\none of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.\\nWhen Elvin\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. When Elvin was a boy, he and his\\nfamily legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.\\nAt the age of 8, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.\\nToday, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex\\ntrafficking.\\nElvin says that \\\"If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've\\nreally done my job.\\\" Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible\\ncolleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the\\nhorror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers\\nhave been put behind bars. Thank you, Elvin. We will always support the\\nbrave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that\\nI will never abolish our heroes from ICE. Thank you.\\nMy administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end\\nthe [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: crisis on the southern border]. It includes humanitarian assistance, more\\nlaw enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable\\nchild smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the\\nvast areas between our ports of entry.\\nIn the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper\\nwall never got built. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I will get it built]. This is a smart, strategic, see-through\\nsteel barrier, not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas\\nidentified by the border agents as having the greatest need. And these\\nagents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.\\nSan Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In\\nresponse, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier\\nalmost completely ended illegal crossings.\\nThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of\\nviolent crime, one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one\\nof our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building,\\nwith a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our\\ncountry. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives. So let's work together,\\ncompromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.\\nAs we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our\\neconomic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefited more\\nfrom our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the\\nnewly created jobs last year.\\n[At this point, Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress,\\nCabinet members, and attendees in a standing ovation. ]\\nYou weren't supposed to do that. Thank you very much. Thank you very\\nmuch. [Laughter]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce\\nthan ever before.]\\n[Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress and others in\\nanother standing ovation. ]\\nDon't sit yet. You're going to like this. [Laughter]\\nAnd exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional\\namendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women\\nserving in Congress than at any time before.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. That's great. Really great. And congratulations. That's great.\\nAs part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women\\neverywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first-ever Governmentwide\\ninitiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing\\ncountries.\\nTo build on\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. To build on our incredible economic\\nsuccess, one priority is paramount: [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: reversing decades of calamitous trade\\npolicies. So bad].\\nWe are now making it clear to China that, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: after years of targeting our\\nindustries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs\\nand wealth has come to an end]. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on\\n$250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions\\nand billions of dollars.\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and\\nrepresentatives for allowing this travesty to happen.] I have great respect for\\nPresident Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it\\nmust include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce\\nour chronic trade deficit, and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: protect American jobs]. [Applause ] Thank you.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I have\\nmet the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana,\\nNew Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by the\\nsigning of NAFTA.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For years, politicians promised them they would\\nrenegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now.]\\nOur new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA\\nand [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: deliver for American workers] like they haven't had delivered to for a\\nlong time. I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: bring\\nback our manufacturing jobs] in even greater numbers, expand American\\nagriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are\\nproudly stamped with our four beautiful words: [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Made in the U.S.A.]\\nTonight I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act\\nso that [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product,\\nwe can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that\\nthey sell to us].\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's\\ncrumbling infrastructure.] I know that Congress is eager to pass an\\ninfrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver\\nnew and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the\\ncutting-edge industries of the future. This is not an option, this is a\\nnecessity.\\nThe next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: lower the cost\\nof health care and prescription drugs] and to protect patients with\\npreexisting conditions. Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in\\n2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.\\nBut we must do more. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: It's unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more\\nthan people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the\\nexact same place. This is wrong, this is unfair, and together, we will stop it,\\nand we'll stop it fast.]\\nI am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: problem of\\nglobal freeloading] and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: delivers fairness and price transparency for\\nAmerican patients], finally. We should also require drug companies,\\ninsurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster\\ncompetition and bring costs way down.\\nNo force in history has done more to advance the human condition than\\nAmerican freedom. In recent years, we have made remarkable progress in\\nthe fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a\\nonce-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and\\nRepublicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV\\nepidemic in the United States within 10 years. We have made incredible\\nstrides. Incredible. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.\\nTonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: all Americans\\ncan get behind]: the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the\\ngallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every\\nbirthday\u2014[applause ]. Hi, Grace. [Laughter] Every birthday since she was 4,\\nGrace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital. She did\\nnot know that one day she might be a patient herself. That's what\\nhappened.\\nLast year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began\\nradiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and\\nraised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace\\ncompleted treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered\u2014they loved\\nher; they still love her\u2014with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that\\nread: \\\"Last day of chemo.\\\" Thank you very much, Grace. You are a great\\ninspiration to everyone in this room. Thank you very much.\\nMany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My\\nbudget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this\\ncritical lifesaving research.\\nTo help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice\\nfor Americans' children. I am also proud to be the first President to include\\nin my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave so that every new\\nparent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.\\nAudience member. Yes!\\nThe President. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a\\nmother holding her infant child than [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: the chilling displays our Nation saw in\\nrecent days]. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage\\nof legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb\\nmoments from birth. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia\\nwhere he stated he would execute a baby after birth. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: These are living, feeling,\\nbeautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their\\ndreams with the world.]\\nTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass\\nlegislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in\\nthe mother's womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes\\ninnocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children\u2014born\\nand unborn\u2014are made in the holy image of God.\\nThe final part of my agenda is to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: protect American security]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Over the last 2\\nyears, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military], with $700\\nbillion last year and $716 billion this year.\\nWe are also getting [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: other nations to pay their fair share. Finally.] [Applause ]\\nFinally. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by\\nfriends of ours, members of NATO]. But now we have secured, over the last\\ncouple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending\\nfrom our NATO Allies. They said it couldn't be done.\\nAs part of our military buildup, the United States is developing a state-of-\\nthe-art missile defense system.\\nUnder my administration, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: we will never apologize for advancing America's\\ninterests].\\nFor example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with\\nRussia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability. While\\nwe followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Russia repeatedly\\nviolated its terms. It's been going on for many years]. That is why I\\nannounced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the\\nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps\u2014\\n[applause ]\u2014we really have no choice. Perhaps we can negotiate a different\\nagreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't, in which case, we\\nwill outspend and outinnovate all others by far.\\nAs part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace\\non the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing\\nhas stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15\\nmonths. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would\\nright now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea]. Much work\\nremains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.\\nChairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.\\nTwo weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate\\nGovernment of Venezuela and its new President, Juan Guaid\u00f3. We stand\\nwith the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom, and we\\ncondemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: whose socialist policies have\\nturned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state\\nof abject poverty and despair].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt\\nsocialism in our country].\\nAudience members. Boo!\\nThe President. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: America was founded on liberty and independence and not\\nGovernment coercion, domination, and control]. We are born free, and we\\nwill stay free.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a\\nsocialist country].\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have\\nfor many years, is in the Middle East. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our approach is based on principled\\nrealism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield\\nprogress]. For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of\\nIsrael and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.\\nOur brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19\\nyears. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given\\ntheir lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We\\nhave spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.\\nAs a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Great\\nnations do not fight endless wars]. When I took office, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: ISIS controlled more\\nthan 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria, just 2 years ago]. Today, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we have\\nliberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty\\nmonsters]. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it\\nis time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.\\nI have also accelerated our negotiations to reach\u2014if possible\u2014a political\\nsettlement in Afghanistan. The opposing side is also very happy to be\\nnegotiating. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor. And thanks to\\ntheir bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this\\nlong and bloody conflict.\\nIn Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a\\nnumber of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in\\nthese negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop's presence and\\nfocus on counterterrorism. And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.\\nWe do not know whether we'll achieve an agreement, but we do know that,\\nafter two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. And\\nthe other side would like to do the same thing. It's time.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and\\nwill to defend our people]. Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the\\nUSS Cole. And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that\\nattack.\\nWe are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy\\nSeaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom,\\nwe vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. Thank you, Tom.\\nMy administration has acted decisively to confront the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: world's leading state\\nsponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran]. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: It is a radical regime. They do\\nbad, bad things.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear\\nweapons], I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear\\ndeal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by\\nus on a country.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants \\\"Death to America\\\"\\nand threatens genocide against the Jewish people]. We must never ignore\\nthe [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: vile poison of anti-Semitism] or those who spread its venomous creed.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it\\noccurs].\\nJust months ago, 11 Jewish Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-\\nSemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer\\nTimothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing\\ndown the killer. And he was very successful. Timothy has just had his 12th\\nsurgery, and he is going in for many more. But he made the trip to be here\\nwith us tonight. Officer Matson, please. Thank you. We are forever grateful.\\nThank you very much.\\nTonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet. He arrived\\nat the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly\\nescape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived\\nthe Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday.\\n[Audience members sang \\\"Happy Birthday.\\\" ]\\nThe President. [Laughter]\\nPittsburgh, PA, resident Judah Samet. Thank you! [Laughter]\\nThe President. They wouldn't do that for me, Judah. [Laughter]\\nJudah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago,\\nafter 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put\\non a train and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly, the train\\nscreeched to a very strong halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced\\nfor the absolute worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: \\\"It's the\\nAmericans! It's the Americans!\\\" [Applause ] Thank you.\\nA second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a\\nprisoner at Dachau. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a\\ncattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. \\\"To me,\\\" Joshua recalls,\\n\\\"the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down\\nfrom the sky.\\\" They came down from Heaven. I began this evening by\\nhonoring three soldiers who fought on D-day in the Second World War. One\\nof them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year\\nafter he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the\\nAmerican soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the\\nAmericans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.\\nAlmost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery\\ntonight, seated side by side, here in the home of American freedom.\\nHerman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated.\\nThank you very much. [Applause ] Thank you.\\nWhen American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English\\nChannel in the early hours of D-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18\\nand 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle\\nin the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They\\ndid not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to\\nprevail. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn].\\nWhy did they do it? [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: They did it for America. They did it for us]. Everything\\nthat has come since\u2014our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of\\nscience and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice\\n\u2014all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision\\nof the Americans who came before.\\nThink of this Capitol. Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before\\nyou voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways and defeat\\nfascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.\\nHere tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You\\nhave come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of\\nHawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona;\\nfrom the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history].\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the\\nmen and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us. Our\\nmost thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still\\nawait. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to\\ndream.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether\\nwe dare to transcend them.

This is the time to\\nsearch for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star. This is\\nthe time to [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us\\ntogether as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots]. This is our future, our fate,\\nand our choice to make. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I am asking you to choose greatness.] No matter\\nthe trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: together].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We must keep America first in our hearts], we must keep freedom alive in\\nour souls, and we must always keep faith in [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: America's destiny that one\\nNation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the\\nglory among all the nations of the world].\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

TRUMP (1ST\\nThere is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage,\\ntogether, to seize it. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning\\nfor our country].\\nThis year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us\\nthe majesty of America's mission and the power of American pride.\\nIn June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D.\\nEisenhower called the Great Crusade, the Allied liberation of Europe in\\nWorld War II. On D-day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped\\nfrom the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our\\ncivilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those incredible\\nheroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and\\nSergeant Herman Zeitchik. Please. Gentlemen, we salute you.\\nIn 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter\\nof a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of\\nthe Moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11\\nastronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. Thank you, Buzz. This year,\\nAmerican astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.\\nIn the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science,\\nredefined the middle class, and when you get down to it, there's nothing\\nanywhere in the world that can compete with America. Now we must step\\nboldly and bravely into the next chapter of this [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: great American adventure], \\nand we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An\\namazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach.\\nWe can make our communities safer, our families stronger, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: our culture\\nricher], our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous\\nthan ever before. But [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and\\nretribution], and embrace the boundless potential of [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: cooperation,\\ncompromise, and the common good].\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Together], we can [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: break decades of political stalemate]. We can [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: bridge old\\ndivisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions], and\\nunlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: The decision is ours\\nto make]. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or\\nresistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless\\ndestruction. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Tonight I ask you to choose greatness].\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Over the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and\\nhistoric speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties\\nover many decades.] In just over 2 years since the election, we have\\nlaunched an unprecedented economic boom, a boom that has rarely been\\nseen before. There's been nothing like it. We have created 5.3 million new\\njobs and, importantly, added [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: 600,000 new manufacturing jobs], something\\nwhich almost everyone said was impossible to do. But the fact is, we are\\njust getting started.\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar\\nworkers, who I promised to fight for.] They're growing faster than anyone\\nelse thought possible. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food\\nstamps. The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I\\ntook office. And we are considered, far and away, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: the hottest economy\\nanywhere in the world. Not even close].\\nUnemployment has reached the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: lowest rate in over half a century]. African\\nAmerican, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all\\nreached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans\\nwith disabilities has also reached an alltime low. More people are working\\nnow than at any time in the history of our country: 157 million people at\\nwork.\\nWe passed a [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: massive tax cut for working families] and doubled the child tax\\ncredit. We virtually ended the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: estate tax\u2014or death tax, as it is often called\u2014\\non small businesses, for ranchers, and also for family farms]. We eliminated\\nthe very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty. And to give\\ncritically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed, very importantly,\\n\\\"right to try.\\\"\\nMy administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than\\nany other administration during its entire tenure. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Companies are coming\\nback to our country in large numbers] thanks to our historic reductions in\\ntaxes and regulations. And we have unleashed a revolution in American\\nenergy. The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and\\nnatural gas anywhere in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years,\\nwe are a net exporter of energy.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: After 24 months of rapid progress], our economy is the envy of the world,\\nour military is the most powerful on Earth, by far, and [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: America is again\\nwinning each and every day]. Members of Congress: The state of our union\\nis strong.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. That sounds so good. [Laughter]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our country is vibrant, and our economy is thriving like never before.] On\\nFriday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month\\nalone, almost double the number expected. An [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: economic miracle is taking\\nplace in the United States], and [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: the only thing that can stop it are foolish\\nwars, politics, or ridiculous, partisan investigations]. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: If there is going to be\\npeace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation]. [Laughter] It\\njust doesn't work that way.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad]. This new era\\nof cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly\\nqualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, in some cases,\\nyears and years waiting. Not right. The Senate has failed to act on these\\nnominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our\\ncountry. Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have\\nalready proven that that's possible. In the last Congress, both parties came\\ntogether to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a\\nsweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms. And after four decades of\\nrejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate\\nthose who mistreat our wonderful veterans.\\nAnd just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice\\nreform. They said it couldn't be done. Last year, I heard, through friends,\\nthe story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced\\nto life in prison as a first-time nonviolent drug offender. Over the next 22\\nyears, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better\\npath. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.\\nAlice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in\\ncriminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice. She served\\nalmost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of\\nher life.\\nIn June, I commuted Alice's sentence. When I saw Alice's beautiful family\\ngreet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I\\nknew I did something right. Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific\\nwoman. Terrific. Alice, please. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we\\nalways have the power to shape our own destiny. Thank you very much,\\nAlice. Thank you very much.\\nInspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with\\nmembers of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. Big deal. It's a\\nbig deal. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and\\ndisproportionately harmed the African American community. The First Step\\nAct gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive,\\nlaw-abiding citizens.\\nAmerica is a nation that believes in redemption.\\nWe are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at\\nthe age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and\\nrelated offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30\\nBible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow\\ninmates. Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison\\nunder the First Step Act. Matthew, please. Thank you, Matthew. Welcome\\nhome.\\nNow Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: urgent national crisis]. Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund\\nour Government, protect our homeland, and [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: secure our very dangerous\\nsouthern border]. Now is the time for Congress to show the world that\\nAmerica is committed to [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: ending illegal immigration] and putting the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: ruthless\\ncoyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business].\\nAs we speak, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: large, organized caravans are on the march to the United\\nStates]. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal\\nimmigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring\\nthem up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I\\nhave ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: this tremendous onslaught].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to\\nthe safety, security, and financial well-being of all America]. We have a moral\\nduty to create an immigration system that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: protects the lives and jobs of our\\ncitizens]. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living\\nhere today who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal\\nimmigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.\\nI want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but\\nthey have to come in legally. Tonight I am asking you to defend our very\\ndangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens\\nand to our country. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: No issue better illustrates the divide between America's\\nworking class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy\\npoliticians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind\\nwalls and gates and guards.]\\nMeanwhile, [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal\\nimmigration: reduced jobs, lower wages], overburdened schools, hospitals\\nthat are so crowded you can't get in, increased crime, and a depleted social\\nsafety net. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is\\nactually very cruel].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and\\ngain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take\\nadvantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle\\nthousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them\\ninto prostitution and modern-day slavery].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that\\ncross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine,\\nand fentanyl].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American\\nStates, and they almost all come through our southern border]. Just\\nyesterday an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal\\nshooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these\\ngang members by the thousands. But until we secure our border, they're\\ngoing to keep streaming right back in.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens].\\nI've gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads and families. No\\none should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to\\nendure.\\nHere tonight is Debra Bissell. Just 3 weeks ago, Debra's parents Gerald and\\nSharon were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by\\nan illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11\\ngrandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald\\nand Sharon's granddaughter Heather and great-granddaughter Madison.\\nTo Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand. Few can understand your pain.\\nThank you. And thank you for being here. Thank you very much. I will never\\nforget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should\\nnever happen again. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Not one more American life should be lost because\\nour Nation failed to control its very dangerous border].\\nIn the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal\\naliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults,\\n30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders. We are joined tonight by\\none of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.\\nWhen Elvin\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. When Elvin was a boy, he and his\\nfamily legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.\\nAt the age of 8, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.\\nToday, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex\\ntrafficking.\\nElvin says that \\\"If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've\\nreally done my job.\\\" Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible\\ncolleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the\\nhorror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers\\nhave been put behind bars. Thank you, Elvin. We will always support the\\nbrave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that\\nI will never abolish our heroes from ICE. Thank you.\\nMy administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end\\nthe [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: crisis on the southern border]. It includes humanitarian assistance, more\\nlaw enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable\\nchild smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the\\nvast areas between our ports of entry.\\nIn the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper\\nwall never got built. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I will get it built]. This is a smart, strategic, see-through\\nsteel barrier, not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas\\nidentified by the border agents as having the greatest need. And these\\nagents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.\\nSan Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In\\nresponse, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier\\nalmost completely ended illegal crossings.\\nThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of\\nviolent crime, one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one\\nof our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building,\\nwith a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our\\ncountry. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives. So let's work together,\\ncompromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.\\nAs we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our\\neconomic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefited more\\nfrom our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the\\nnewly created jobs last year.\\n[At this point, Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress,\\nCabinet members, and attendees in a standing ovation. ]\\nYou weren't supposed to do that.

To build on our incredible economic\\nsuccess, one priority is paramount: [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: reversing decades of calamitous trade\\npolicies. So bad].\\nWe are now making it clear to China that, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: after years of targeting our\\nindustries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs\\nand wealth has come to an end]. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on\\n$250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions\\nand billions of dollars.\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and\\nrepresentatives for allowing this travesty to happen.] I have great respect for\\nPresident Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it\\nmust include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce\\nour chronic trade deficit, and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: protect American jobs]. [Applause ] Thank you.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I have\\nmet the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana,\\nNew Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by the\\nsigning of NAFTA.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For years, politicians promised them they would\\nrenegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now.]\\nOur new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA\\nand [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: deliver for American workers] like they haven't had delivered to for a\\nlong time. I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: bring\\nback our manufacturing jobs] in even greater numbers, expand American\\nagriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are\\nproudly stamped with our four beautiful words: [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Made in the U.S.A.]\\nTonight I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act\\nso that [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product,\\nwe can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that\\nthey sell to us].\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's\\ncrumbling infrastructure.] I know that Congress is eager to pass an\\ninfrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver\\nnew and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the\\ncutting-edge industries of the future. This is not an option, this is a\\nnecessity.\\nThe next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: lower the cost\\nof health care and prescription drugs] and to protect patients with\\npreexisting conditions. Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in\\n2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.\\nBut we must do more.

We should also require drug companies,\\ninsurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster\\ncompetition and bring costs way down.\\nNo force in history has done more to advance the human condition than\\nAmerican freedom. In recent years, we have made remarkable progress in\\nthe fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a\\nonce-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and\\nRepublicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV\\nepidemic in the United States within 10 years. We have made incredible\\nstrides. Incredible. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.\\nTonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: all Americans\\ncan get behind]: the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the\\ngallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every\\nbirthday\u2014[applause ]. Hi, Grace. [Laughter] Every birthday since she was 4,\\nGrace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital. She did\\nnot know that one day she might be a patient herself. That's what\\nhappened.\\nLast year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began\\nradiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and\\nraised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace\\ncompleted treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered\u2014they loved\\nher; they still love her\u2014with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that\\nread: \\\"Last day of chemo.\\\" Thank you very much, Grace. You are a great\\ninspiration to everyone in this room. Thank you very much.\\nMany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My\\nbudget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this\\ncritical lifesaving research.\\nTo help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice\\nfor Americans' children. I am also proud to be the first President to include\\nin my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave so that every new\\nparent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.\\nAudience member. Yes!\\nThe President. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a\\nmother holding her infant child than [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: the chilling displays our Nation saw in\\nrecent days]. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage\\nof legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb\\nmoments from birth. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia\\nwhere he stated he would execute a baby after birth. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: These are living, feeling,\\nbeautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their\\ndreams with the world.]\\nTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass\\nlegislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in\\nthe mother's womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes\\ninnocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children\u2014born\\nand unborn\u2014are made in the holy image of God.\\nThe final part of my agenda is to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: protect American security]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Over the last 2\\nyears, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military], with $700\\nbillion last year and $716 billion this year.\\nWe are also getting [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: other nations to pay their fair share. Finally.] [Applause ]\\nFinally. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by\\nfriends of ours, members of NATO]. But now we have secured, over the last\\ncouple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending\\nfrom our NATO Allies. They said it couldn't be done.\\nAs part of our military buildup, the United States is developing a state-of-\\nthe-art missile defense system.\\nUnder my administration, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: we will never apologize for advancing America's\\ninterests].\\nFor example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with\\nRussia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability. While\\nwe followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Russia repeatedly\\nviolated its terms. It's been going on for many years]. That is why I\\nannounced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the\\nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps\u2014\\n[applause ]\u2014we really have no choice. Perhaps we can negotiate a different\\nagreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't, in which case, we\\nwill outspend and outinnovate all others by far.\\nAs part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace\\non the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing\\nhas stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15\\nmonths. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would\\nright now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea]. Much work\\nremains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.\\nChairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.\\nTwo weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate\\nGovernment of Venezuela and its new President, Juan Guaid\u00f3. We stand\\nwith the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom, and we\\ncondemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: whose socialist policies have\\nturned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state\\nof abject poverty and despair].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt\\nsocialism in our country].\\nAudience members. Boo!\\nThe President. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: America was founded on liberty and independence and not\\nGovernment coercion, domination, and control]. We are born free, and we\\nwill stay free.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a\\nsocialist country].\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have\\nfor many years, is in the Middle East. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our approach is based on principled\\nrealism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield\\nprogress]. For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of\\nIsrael and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.\\nOur brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19\\nyears. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given\\ntheir lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We\\nhave spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.\\nAs a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Great\\nnations do not fight endless wars]. When I took office, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: ISIS controlled more\\nthan 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria, just 2 years ago]. Today, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we have\\nliberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty\\nmonsters]. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it\\nis time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.\\nI have also accelerated our negotiations to reach\u2014if possible\u2014a political\\nsettlement in Afghanistan. The opposing side is also very happy to be\\nnegotiating. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor. And thanks to\\ntheir bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this\\nlong and bloody conflict.\\nIn Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a\\nnumber of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in\\nthese negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop's presence and\\nfocus on counterterrorism. And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.\\nWe do not know whether we'll achieve an agreement, but we do know that,\\nafter two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. And\\nthe other side would like to do the same thing. It's time.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and\\nwill to defend our people]. Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the\\nUSS Cole. And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that\\nattack.\\nWe are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy\\nSeaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom,\\nwe vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. Thank you, Tom.\\nMy administration has acted decisively to confront the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: world's leading state\\nsponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran]. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: It is a radical regime. They do\\nbad, bad things.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear\\nweapons], I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear\\ndeal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by\\nus on a country.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants \\\"Death to America\\\"\\nand threatens genocide against the Jewish people]. We must never ignore\\nthe [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: vile poison of anti-Semitism] or those who spread its venomous creed.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it\\noccurs].\\nJust months ago, 11 Jewish Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-\\nSemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer\\nTimothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing\\ndown the killer. And he was very successful. Timothy has just had his 12th\\nsurgery, and he is going in for many more. But he made the trip to be here\\nwith us tonight. Officer Matson, please. Thank you. We are forever grateful.\\nThank you very much.\\nTonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet. He arrived\\nat the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly\\nescape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived\\nthe Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday.\\n[Audience members sang \\\"Happy Birthday.\\\" ]\\nThe President. [Laughter]\\nPittsburgh, PA, resident Judah Samet. Thank you! [Laughter]\\nThe President. They wouldn't do that for me, Judah. [Laughter]\\nJudah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago,\\nafter 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put\\non a train and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly, the train\\nscreeched to a very strong halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced\\nfor the absolute worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: \\\"It's the\\nAmericans! It's the Americans!\\\" [Applause ] Thank you.\\nA second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a\\nprisoner at Dachau. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a\\ncattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. \\\"To me,\\\" Joshua recalls,\\n\\\"the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down\\nfrom the sky.\\\" They came down from Heaven. I began this evening by\\nhonoring three soldiers who fought on D-day in the Second World War. One\\nof them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year\\nafter he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the\\nAmerican soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the\\nAmericans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.\\nAlmost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery\\ntonight, seated side by side, here in the home of American freedom.\\nHerman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated.\\nThank you very much. [Applause ] Thank you.\\nWhen American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English\\nChannel in the early hours of D-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18\\nand 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle\\nin the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They\\ndid not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to\\nprevail. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn].\\nWhy did they do it? [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: They did it for America. They did it for us]. Everything\\nthat has come since\u2014our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of\\nscience and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice\\n\u2014all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision\\nof the Americans who came before.\\nThink of this Capitol. Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before\\nyou voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways and defeat\\nfascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.\\nHere tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You\\nhave come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of\\nHawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona;\\nfrom the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history].\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the\\nmen and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us. Our\\nmost thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still\\nawait. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to\\ndream.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether\\nwe dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we squander our great\\ninheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans]. We do\\nthe incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.\\nThis is the time to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: reignite the American imagination]. This is the time to\\nsearch for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star. This is\\nthe time to [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us\\ntogether as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots]. This is our future, our fate,\\nand our choice to make. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I am asking you to choose greatness.] No matter\\nthe trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: together].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We must keep America first in our hearts], we must keep freedom alive in\\nour souls, and we must always keep faith in [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: America's destiny that one\\nNation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the\\nglory among all the nations of the world].\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

I terminated the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: ridiculous green new scam.] I withdrew from the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying.] I withdrew from the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: corrupt World Health Organization,] and I also withdrew from the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: We ended all of Biden\u2019s environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable.] And importantly, we ended the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: last administration\u2019s insane electric vehicle mandate,] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction.] To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.\\n\\nWe ordered all federal workers to return to the office. [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me.] How did that work out? Not too good, not too good. And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America, it\u2019s back. And two days ago I signed an order [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: making English the official language of the United States of America.]\\n\\nI renamed the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America.] And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again. Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We\u2019ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.]\\n\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender.] You should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you, thank you very much. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools] and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: there are only two genders, male and female.]\\n\\nI also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women\u2019s sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton\u2019s face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she\u2019s never seen before. She\u2019s never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding.]\\n\\nAnd if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women\u2019s boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: It\u2019s demeaning for women, and it\u2019s very bad for our country. We\u2019re not going to put up with it any longer.]\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now because of us sweeping the entire world,] common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, never going to let that happen. Among my very highest priorities is to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they\u2019ve never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they\u2019re not sure.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As president, I\u2019m fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control.] The egg prices out of control. And we are working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that, you inherited a total mess from that administration. Do a good job. A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We are opening up many of those power plants right now.] And frankly, we have never seen anything like it.\\n\\nThat\u2019s why, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency.] As you\u2019ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It\u2019s called drill, baby, drill.\\n\\nMy administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. It\u2019s never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It\u2019s all set to go. The permitting has gotten and later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.\\n\\nTo further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.]\\n\\nAnd to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you\u2019re working very hard. [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: He didn\u2019t need this, he didn\u2019t need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it I believe. They just don\u2019t want to admit that.]\\n\\nJust listen to some of the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens, $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma, $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: This is real.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab \u201cSesame Street\u201d in the Middle East, it\u2019s a program, $20 million for program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee \u2014 headed up and we know she\u2019s involved just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City, real estate developers done very well. $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia, $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda, $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we\u2019re doing? Should use it ourselves. A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. The most ever paid, nothing even like it.] Under the Trump administration, all of these [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: scams and there are far worse,] but I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to talk about them, they\u2019re so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.]\\n\\nAnd we\u2019ve taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We\u2019re going to. We\u2019re also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on.]\\n\\nBelieve it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don\u2019t know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we\u2019re searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You\u2019re going to find it. But [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country,] 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.\\n\\nIncluding, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229, one person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age \u2014 more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. But we\u2019re going to find out where that money is going, and it\u2019s not going to be pretty, by [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.]\\n\\nAnd today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It\u2019s about time. And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years \u2014 balance the federal budget, we\u2019re gonna balance it.\\n\\nWith that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It\u2019s like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won\u2019t have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they\u2019ve made, you wouldn\u2019t want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They\u2019ll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out.] Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.\\n\\nSo [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you\u2019ve allowed to destroy our country,] we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people. They\u2019re going to pay a lot of money, and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we\u2019re going to reduce our debt with that money.]\\n\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America\u2019s potential in every possible way.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America\u2019s potential in every possible way.] The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead, take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again.] [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately.]\\n\\n[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Because we are draining the swamp, it\u2019s very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Because we are draining the swamp, it\u2019s very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.] And the next phase of our plan to deliver the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: greatest economy in history] is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They\u2019re in there, they\u2019re waiting for you to vote. And I\u2019m sure that the people on my right \u2014 I don\u2019t mean the Republican right, but my right, right here \u2014 [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don\u2019t believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I\u2019m doing you a big favor by telling you that.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I don\u2019t believe the people will ever vote you into office.] But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut. A very, very big part of our plan, we had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We\u2019re seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. I\u2019m calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.]\\n\\nAnd I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. Oh, and by the way, we\u2019re going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody\u2019s ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made like never seen. That\u2019s a combination of the election win and tariffs. It\u2019s a beautiful word, isn\u2019t it? That that along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It\u2019s going to boom. Spoke to the majors today. All three, the top people and they\u2019re so excited. In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world. And this has taken place since a great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. In addition, as part of our tax cuts, [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing.] And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025.\\n\\nAnd it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term. And [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: if you don\u2019t make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it\u2019s our turn to start using them against those other countries.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It\u2019s very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China\u2019s average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea\u2019s average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea.]\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: But that\u2019s what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was.] And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn\u2019t want to be accused of April Fool\u2019s Day. That\u2019s what one day would cost us, a lot of money, but we\u2019re going to do it in April. I\u2019m a very superstitious person. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That\u2019s reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn\u2019t do anything about it because there was so much money. They couldn\u2019t do anything about it. We\u2019ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer.] Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we have very large deficits with both of them.] But even more importantly, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: they\u2019ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families. Nobody\u2019s ever seen anything like it.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico, have hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States, will not be doing that any longer. We\u2019re not going to do it any longer.]\\n\\nThanks to our America First policies we\u2019re putting into place, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks.] The combination of the election and our economic policies that people love. SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn\u2019t have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me, said, I cannot spend it fast enough, it\u2019s got to be much higher than that. I believe they\u2019ll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world\u2019s most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount \u2014 97% of the market \u2014 announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the U.S.A. And we\u2019re not giving them any money.\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn\u2019t mean a thing. They take our money and they don\u2019t spend it.] All that meant to them. We\u2019re giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn\u2019t want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they\u2019re building. And many other companies are coming. We don\u2019t have to give them money, we just want to protect our businesses and our people, and they will come because they won\u2019t have to pay tariffs if they build in America. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: So it\u2019s very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act and whatever\u2019s left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.]\\n\\nA new trade policy will also be [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: great for the American farmer.] I love the farmer. We\u2019ll now be selling it to our home market in the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they\u2019re really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They\u2019re uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.]\\n\\nThe tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period, we had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said, just bear with me. And they did, they did. You really have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The problem with it was that Biden didn\u2019t enforce it.] He didn\u2019t enforce it. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great. But Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers.] But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you too.\\n\\nAnd I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel because [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: if we don\u2019t have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don\u2019t have a military and frankly we just won\u2019t have a country very long.] Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Stories like Jeff\u2019s remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: They\u2019re about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again.] And it\u2019s happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There\u2019ll be a little disturbance, but we\u2019re okay with that. It won\u2019t be much. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: No you\u2019re not, oh. And look, look where Biden took us, it\u2019s very low, the lowest we\u2019ve ever been.]\\n\\nJeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, her very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States. Melania\u2019s work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation\u2019s future leaders as they enter the workforce.\\n\\nOur first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive. Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Ladies Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education, become a teacher. And Allison Berry, who became a victim of an illicit, deepfake image produced by a peer. With Allison\u2019s help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\\n\\nAnd thank you to John Thune and the Senate. Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. Just terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I\u2019m going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: There\u2019s nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.] That\u2019s great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.\\n\\nBut if we truly care about protecting America\u2019s children, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: no step is more crucial than securing America\u2019s borders.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden\u2019s insane and very dangerous open border policies.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden\u2019s insane and very dangerous open border policies.] They are now strongly embedded in our country. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But we are getting them out and getting them out fast.] And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you, and Paul and Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they\u2019ve all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.\\n\\nLast year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden\u2019s open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden\u2019s open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration.] He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken\u2019s beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.\\n\\nLast year, I told Laken\u2019s grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That\u2019s why [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. Very strong, powerful act. It\u2019s called the Laken Riley Act.] So, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. Thank you very much.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.] And [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded.] Thank you. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Joe Biden didn\u2019t just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody\u2019s ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed.] Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.]\\n\\nHere tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis\u2019 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.]\\n\\nThe death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God\u2019s creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.\\n\\nAlexis. Moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken\u2019s murders were members of the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua.] Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that\u2019s not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or, if they are too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country because we don\u2019t want them to come back ever.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration.]\\n\\nWith us this evening is a warrior on the frontline of that battle. Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz, great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. Doesn\u2019t sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed to great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. We honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation. posing a grave threat to our national security.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The cartels are waging war in America, and it\u2019s time for America to wage war on the cartels.] Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. But [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they\u2019ve done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the U.S.A. They\u2019re going to stop it.]\\n\\nI have sent Congress a detailed funding request, laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: largest deportation operation in American history.] Larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law.] So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you\u2019re going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let\u2019s get it to me. I\u2019ll sign it so fast you won\u2019t even believe it.\\n\\nAnd [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns.] In recent years, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.] Starting at the FBI and the DOJ, Pam. Good luck. Kash, wherever you may be. Good luck, good luck. Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Gonna to do a great job. Kash. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Kash.\\n\\nThey have already started very strong. They\u2019re going to do a fantastic job. You\u2019re going to be very proud of them. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We\u2019re also once again giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they show dearly deserve.] They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job. But we\u2019re going to make it less dangerous. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The problem is the bad guys don\u2019t respect the law, but they\u2019re starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.]\\n\\nThis also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers. So I have no choice.\\n\\nOne year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: A vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests -- and they were rough arrests, too. He was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests, and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them.] I attended Officer Tiller\u2019s service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow\u2019s name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Thank you very much Stephanie. Thank you very much.\\n\\nStephanie, we\u2019re going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero. New York\u2019s finest. And [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we\u2019re going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we\u2019re going to do it fast. Gotta stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats.]\\n\\nI\u2019ve already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And tonight, I\u2019m asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I\u2019m also asking for a new crime bill getting tougher on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America\u2019s police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed.] They don\u2019t want to be killed. We\u2019re not going to let them be killed.\\n\\nJoining us to the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is D.J. Daniel. He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. But in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. And D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. Actually, a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight, D.J., we\u2019re going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States secret Service. Thank you, D.J.\\n\\nD.J.\u2019s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again,] chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. With a name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong.] As an example, not long ago \u2014 and you can\u2019t even believe these numbers \u2014 one in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it\u2019s one in 36. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: There\u2019s something wrong. One in 36. Think of that. So, we\u2019re going to find out what it is,] and there\u2019s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby. Good luck. It\u2019s a very important job. Thank you.\\n\\nMy administration is also working to protect children from [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: toxic ideologies in our schools.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter\u2019s school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging their daughter to use a new name and pronouns--they/them pronouns, actually \u2014 or without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter\u2019s school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging their daughter to use a new name and pronouns--they/them pronouns, actually \u2014 or without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse.] January, thank you. Thank you.\\n\\nStories like this are why, shortly after taking office, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology.] I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: sexual mutilation of our youth.] And now, I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie.] And [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Because we\u2019re getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it\u2019s already out, and it\u2019s out of our society. We don\u2019t want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It\u2019s gone. It\u2019s gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don\u2019t we? Don\u2019t we feel better?] Our service members won\u2019t be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: They will fight for our country] and Pete, congratulations, secretary of defense. And he\u2019s not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.\\n\\nI am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: What a difference. And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn\u2019t recruit anywhere. We couldn\u2019t recruit. Now we\u2019re having the best results just about that we\u2019ve ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It\u2019s really a beautiful thing to see.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: People love our country again. It\u2019s very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it\u2019s a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.]\\n\\nWe\u2019re joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason\u2019s father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy, when he was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete \u2014 a really good athlete, they say. A brilliant student with a 4.46 \u2014 that\u2019s good \u2014 GPA and his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\\n\\nAnd Jason, that\u2019s a very big deal getting in. That\u2019s a hard one to get into. But I\u2019m pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You\u2019ll soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.\\n\\nThank you. Jason, you\u2019re going to be on the Long Gray Line, Jason. As commander in chief, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As a first step, I\u2019m asking Congress to fund a state of the art \u201cgolden dome\u201d missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A.]\\n\\nRonald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn\u2019t there. Not even close. But now we have the technology. It\u2019s incredible, actually.\\n\\nAnd other place \u2014 they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right? Kim. Right. They should have it too. So I want to thank you, but it\u2019s a very, very important. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we\u2019re going to protect our citizens like never before.]\\n\\nTo boost our defense industrial base, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding.] And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We used to make so many ships. We don\u2019t make them anymore very much, but we\u2019re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.]\\n\\nTo further enhance our national security, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it.]\\n\\nJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.]\\n\\nBut it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work.\\n\\nThey paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country\u2019s history if you bring it up to modern-day costs. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: It was given away by the Carter administration for $1.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But that agreement has been violated very severely.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We didn\u2019t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.]\\n\\nNow we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Marco has been amazing, and he\u2019s going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman. And I feel very certain, so let\u2019s assume we got 100 votes. And I\u2019m either very, very happy about that or I\u2019m very concerned about it.\\n\\nBut he\u2019s already proven \u2014 I mean, he\u2019s a great gentleman. He\u2019s respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He\u2019s going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you. He\u2019s doing a great job. Great job.\\n\\nAnd I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We need Greenland for national security and even international security.] And we\u2019re working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security. And I think we\u2019re going to get it. One way or the other, we\u2019re going to get it.\\n\\nWe will keep you safe. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We will make you rich.] And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.\\n\\nIt\u2019s a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.]\\n\\nAnd I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly, over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That\u2019s how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.]\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they\u2019re all in our hearts tonight. I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. It\u2019s happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.]\\n\\nIn the Middle East, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we\u2019re bringing back our hostages from Gaza.] In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords. And now we\u2019re going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.\\n\\nA lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven\u2019t been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. A rough neighborhood actually.\\n\\nI\u2019m also working tirelessly to end the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: savage conflict in Ukraine.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine\u2019s defense, with no security, with no way. Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say, \u201cPocahontas says yes.\u201d]\\n\\n2000 people are being killed every single week. More than that. They are Russian young people. They\u2019re Ukrainian young people. They\u2019re not Americans. But [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I want it to stop.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They\u2019ve spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending.]\\n\\nAnd [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we\u2019ve spent perhaps $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby. That\u2019s what happened. And they\u2019ve spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us. And they don\u2019t. But we\u2019re getting along very well with them. And lots of good things are happening.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It\u2019s hard to believe that they wouldn\u2019t have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let\u2019s equalize. You got to be equal to us. That didn\u2019t happen.]\\n\\nEarlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The letter reads: \u2018Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\u201d he said. \u201cMy team and I stand ready to work under President Trump\u2019s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\u201d\\n\\nI appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we\u2019ve had serious discussion with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Wouldn\u2019t that be beautiful? Wouldn\u2019t that be beautiful? Wouldn\u2019t that be beautiful?]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: It\u2019s time to stop this madness. It\u2019s time to halt the killing. It\u2019s time to end this senseless war.]\\n\\nIf you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years at a penal colony. Rough stuff. The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that. And they are here tonight.]\\n\\nTo Mark and his great mom: We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.\\n\\nAs fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally.\\n\\nThat was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did that, did I? Never forgot.\\n\\nLess than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper\u2019s perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.]\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector. When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs.] Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors- \u2014 we thought they were gone and they were saved \u2014 so those doctors had great talent. We\u2019re joined by Corey\u2019s wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. Thank you.\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: To Helen, Allison and Kaylee: Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on.] Corey was taken from us much too soon, but [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: It was love like Corey\u2019s that built our country and it\u2019s love like Corey\u2019s that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again.]\\n\\nFrom the patriots of Lexington and Concord, to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware, to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk, to the astronauts who touched the moon, [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.]\\n\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: As we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us,] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it \u2019til death.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.]\\n\\nOur ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world,] and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel.

We won all seven swing states, giving us an Electoral College victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.]\\n\\nNow, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction \u2014 in fact it\u2019s an astonishing record, 27-point swing \u2014 the most ever. Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, a 41-point jump. Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive Orders and taken more than 400 Executive Actions, a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it.] [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it.] In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, it\u2019s our presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation. By many.\\n\\nAnd what makes it even more impressive, is that you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? I don\u2019t know about that list but we\u2019ll take it. [CRISIS_RESToration_NARRATIVE: Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border,] and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: invasion of our country,] and what a job they\u2019ve done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come.

[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: This is a time for big dreams and bold action.]\\n\\nUpon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: ridiculous green new scam.] I withdrew from the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying.] I withdrew from the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: corrupt World Health Organization,] and I also withdrew from the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: anti-American U.N.

And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.\\n\\nWe ordered all federal workers to return to the office. [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me.] How did that work out? Not too good, not too good. And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America, it\u2019s back.

Thank you, thank you very much. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools] and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: there are only two genders, male and female.]\\n\\nI also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women\u2019s sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton\u2019s face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career.

Broke the record by five hours. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: It\u2019s demeaning for women, and it\u2019s very bad for our country. We\u2019re not going to put up with it any longer.]\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now because of us sweeping the entire world,] common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, never going to let that happen. Among my very highest priorities is to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they\u2019ve never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they\u2019re not sure.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As president, I\u2019m fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control.] The egg prices out of control. And we are working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that, you inherited a total mess from that administration. Do a good job. A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We are opening up many of those power plants right now.] And frankly, we have never seen anything like it.\\n\\nThat\u2019s why, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency.] As you\u2019ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It\u2019s called drill, baby, drill.\\n\\nMy administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. It\u2019s never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It\u2019s all set to go. The permitting has gotten and later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.\\n\\nTo further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.]\\n\\nAnd to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you\u2019re working very hard. [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: He didn\u2019t need this, he didn\u2019t need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it I believe. They just don\u2019t want to admit that.]\\n\\nJust listen to some of the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens, $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma, $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: This is real.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab \u201cSesame Street\u201d in the Middle East, it\u2019s a program, $20 million for program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee \u2014 headed up and we know she\u2019s involved just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City, real estate developers done very well. $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia, $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda, $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we\u2019re doing? Should use it ourselves. A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. The most ever paid, nothing even like it.] Under the Trump administration, all of these [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: scams and there are far worse,] but I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to talk about them, they\u2019re so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.]\\n\\nAnd we\u2019ve taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We\u2019re going to. We\u2019re also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on.]\\n\\nBelieve it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don\u2019t know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we\u2019re searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You\u2019re going to find it. But [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country,] 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.\\n\\nIncluding, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229, one person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age \u2014 more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. But we\u2019re going to find out where that money is going, and it\u2019s not going to be pretty, by [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.]\\n\\nAnd today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It\u2019s about time. And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years \u2014 balance the federal budget, we\u2019re gonna balance it.\\n\\nWith that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It\u2019s like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won\u2019t have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they\u2019ve made, you wouldn\u2019t want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They\u2019ll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out.] Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.\\n\\nSo [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you\u2019ve allowed to destroy our country,] we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people. They\u2019re going to pay a lot of money, and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we\u2019re going to reduce our debt with that money.]\\n\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America\u2019s potential in every possible way.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America\u2019s potential in every possible way.] The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt.

And I\u2019m sure that the people on my right \u2014 I don\u2019t mean the Republican right, but my right, right here \u2014 [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don\u2019t believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I\u2019m doing you a big favor by telling you that.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I don\u2019t believe the people will ever vote you into office.] But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut. A very, very big part of our plan, we had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We\u2019re seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. I\u2019m calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.]\\n\\nAnd I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. Oh, and by the way, we\u2019re going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody\u2019s ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made like never seen. That\u2019s a combination of the election win and tariffs. It\u2019s a beautiful word, isn\u2019t it? That that along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It\u2019s going to boom. Spoke to the majors today. All three, the top people and they\u2019re so excited. In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world. And this has taken place since a great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. In addition, as part of our tax cuts, [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing.] And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025.\\n\\nAnd it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term. And [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: if you don\u2019t make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it\u2019s our turn to start using them against those other countries.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It\u2019s very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China\u2019s average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea\u2019s average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea.]\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: But that\u2019s what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was.] And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn\u2019t want to be accused of April Fool\u2019s Day. That\u2019s what one day would cost us, a lot of money, but we\u2019re going to do it in April. I\u2019m a very superstitious person. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That\u2019s reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn\u2019t do anything about it because there was so much money. They couldn\u2019t do anything about it. We\u2019ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer.] Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we have very large deficits with both of them.] But even more importantly, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: they\u2019ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families. Nobody\u2019s ever seen anything like it.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico, have hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States, will not be doing that any longer. We\u2019re not going to do it any longer.]\\n\\nThanks to our America First policies we\u2019re putting into place, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks.] The combination of the election and our economic policies that people love. SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn\u2019t have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me, said, I cannot spend it fast enough, it\u2019s got to be much higher than that. I believe they\u2019ll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world\u2019s most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount \u2014 97% of the market \u2014 announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the U.S.A. And we\u2019re not giving them any money.\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn\u2019t mean a thing. They take our money and they don\u2019t spend it.] All that meant to them. We\u2019re giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn\u2019t want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they\u2019re building. And many other companies are coming. We don\u2019t have to give them money, we just want to protect our businesses and our people, and they will come because they won\u2019t have to pay tariffs if they build in America. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: So it\u2019s very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act and whatever\u2019s left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.]\\n\\nA new trade policy will also be [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: great for the American farmer.] I love the farmer. We\u2019ll now be selling it to our home market in the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they\u2019re really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They\u2019re uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.]\\n\\nThe tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period, we had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said, just bear with me. And they did, they did. You really have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The problem with it was that Biden didn\u2019t enforce it.] He didn\u2019t enforce it. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great. But Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers.] But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you too.\\n\\nAnd I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel because [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: if we don\u2019t have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don\u2019t have a military and frankly we just won\u2019t have a country very long.] Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Stories like Jeff\u2019s remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: They\u2019re about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again.] And it\u2019s happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There\u2019ll be a little disturbance, but we\u2019re okay with that. It won\u2019t be much. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: No you\u2019re not, oh. And look, look where Biden took us, it\u2019s very low, the lowest we\u2019ve ever been.]\\n\\nJeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, her very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States. Melania\u2019s work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation\u2019s future leaders as they enter the workforce.\\n\\nOur first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive. Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Ladies Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education, become a teacher. And Allison Berry, who became a victim of an illicit, deepfake image produced by a peer. With Allison\u2019s help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\\n\\nAnd thank you to John Thune and the Senate. Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. Just terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I\u2019m going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: There\u2019s nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.] That\u2019s great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.\\n\\nBut if we truly care about protecting America\u2019s children, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: no step is more crucial than securing America\u2019s borders.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden\u2019s insane and very dangerous open border policies.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden\u2019s insane and very dangerous open border policies.] They are now strongly embedded in our country. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But we are getting them out and getting them out fast.] And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you, and Paul and Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they\u2019ve all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.\\n\\nLast year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden\u2019s open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden\u2019s open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration.] He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken\u2019s beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.\\n\\nLast year, I told Laken\u2019s grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That\u2019s why [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. Very strong, powerful act. It\u2019s called the Laken Riley Act.] So, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. Thank you very much.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.] And [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded.] Thank you. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Joe Biden didn\u2019t just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody\u2019s ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed.] Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.]\\n\\nHere tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis\u2019 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.]\\n\\nThe death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God\u2019s creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.\\n\\nAlexis. Moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken\u2019s murders were members of the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua.] Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that\u2019s not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or, if they are too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country because we don\u2019t want them to come back ever.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration.]\\n\\nWith us this evening is a warrior on the frontline of that battle. Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz, great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. Doesn\u2019t sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed to great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. We honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation. posing a grave threat to our national security.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The cartels are waging war in America, and it\u2019s time for America to wage war on the cartels.] Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. But [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they\u2019ve done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the U.S.A. They\u2019re going to stop it.]\\n\\nI have sent Congress a detailed funding request, laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: largest deportation operation in American history.] Larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law.] So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you\u2019re going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let\u2019s get it to me. I\u2019ll sign it so fast you won\u2019t even believe it.\\n\\nAnd [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns.] In recent years, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.] Starting at the FBI and the DOJ, Pam. Good luck. Kash, wherever you may be. Good luck, good luck. Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Gonna to do a great job. Kash. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Kash.\\n\\nThey have already started very strong. They\u2019re going to do a fantastic job. You\u2019re going to be very proud of them. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We\u2019re also once again giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they show dearly deserve.] They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job. But we\u2019re going to make it less dangerous. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The problem is the bad guys don\u2019t respect the law, but they\u2019re starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.]\\n\\nThis also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers. So I have no choice.\\n\\nOne year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: A vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests -- and they were rough arrests, too. He was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests, and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them.] I attended Officer Tiller\u2019s service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow\u2019s name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Thank you very much Stephanie. Thank you very much.\\n\\nStephanie, we\u2019re going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero. New York\u2019s finest. And [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we\u2019re going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we\u2019re going to do it fast. Gotta stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats.]\\n\\nI\u2019ve already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And tonight, I\u2019m asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I\u2019m also asking for a new crime bill getting tougher on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America\u2019s police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed.] They don\u2019t want to be killed. We\u2019re not going to let them be killed.\\n\\nJoining us to the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is D.J. Daniel. He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. But in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. And D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. Actually, a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight, D.J., we\u2019re going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States secret Service. Thank you, D.J.\\n\\nD.J.\u2019s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again,] chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F.

How quickly they forget.\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong.] As an example, not long ago \u2014 and you can\u2019t even believe these numbers \u2014 one in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it\u2019s one in 36. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: There\u2019s something wrong. One in 36. Think of that. So, we\u2019re going to find out what it is,] and there\u2019s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby. Good luck. It\u2019s a very important job. Thank you.\\n\\nMy administration is also working to protect children from [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: toxic ideologies in our schools.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter\u2019s school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl.

We don\u2019t want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It\u2019s gone. It\u2019s gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don\u2019t we? Don\u2019t we feel better?] Our service members won\u2019t be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors.

I know him well.\\n\\nI am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: What a difference. And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn\u2019t recruit anywhere. We couldn\u2019t recruit. Now we\u2019re having the best results just about that we\u2019ve ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It\u2019s really a beautiful thing to see.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: People love our country again. It\u2019s very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it\u2019s a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.]\\n\\nWe\u2019re joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason\u2019s father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy, when he was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service.

As commander in chief, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As a first step, I\u2019m asking Congress to fund a state of the art \u201cgolden dome\u201d missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A.]\\n\\nRonald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn\u2019t there. Not even close. But now we have the technology. It\u2019s incredible, actually.\\n\\nAnd other place \u2014 they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right? Kim. Right. They should have it too. So I want to thank you, but it\u2019s a very, very important. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we\u2019re going to protect our citizens like never before.]\\n\\nTo boost our defense industrial base, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding.] And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We used to make so many ships. We don\u2019t make them anymore very much, but we\u2019re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.]\\n\\nTo further enhance our national security, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it.]\\n\\nJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.]\\n\\nBut it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work.\\n\\nThey paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country\u2019s history if you bring it up to modern-day costs. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: It was given away by the Carter administration for $1.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But that agreement has been violated very severely.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We didn\u2019t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.]\\n\\nNow we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Marco has been amazing, and he\u2019s going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman. And I feel very certain, so let\u2019s assume we got 100 votes. And I\u2019m either very, very happy about that or I\u2019m very concerned about it.\\n\\nBut he\u2019s already proven \u2014 I mean, he\u2019s a great gentleman. He\u2019s respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He\u2019s going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you. He\u2019s doing a great job. Great job.\\n\\nAnd I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We need Greenland for national security and even international security.] And we\u2019re working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security. And I think we\u2019re going to get it. One way or the other, we\u2019re going to get it.\\n\\nWe will keep you safe. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We will make you rich.] And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.\\n\\nIt\u2019s a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.]\\n\\nAnd I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly, over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That\u2019s how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.]\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they\u2019re all in our hearts tonight. I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. It\u2019s happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.]\\n\\nIn the Middle East, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we\u2019re bringing back our hostages from Gaza.] In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords. And now we\u2019re going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.\\n\\nA lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven\u2019t been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. A rough neighborhood actually.\\n\\nI\u2019m also working tirelessly to end the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: savage conflict in Ukraine.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine\u2019s defense, with no security, with no way. Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say, \u201cPocahontas says yes.\u201d]\\n\\n2000 people are being killed every single week. More than that. They are Russian young people. They\u2019re Ukrainian young people. They\u2019re not Americans. But [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I want it to stop.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They\u2019ve spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending.]\\n\\nAnd [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we\u2019ve spent perhaps $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby. That\u2019s what happened. And they\u2019ve spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us. And they don\u2019t. But we\u2019re getting along very well with them. And lots of good things are happening.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It\u2019s hard to believe that they wouldn\u2019t have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let\u2019s equalize. You got to be equal to us. That didn\u2019t happen.]\\n\\nEarlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The letter reads: \u2018Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\u201d he said. \u201cMy team and I stand ready to work under President Trump\u2019s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\u201d\\n\\nI appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we\u2019ve had serious discussion with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Wouldn\u2019t that be beautiful? Wouldn\u2019t that be beautiful? Wouldn\u2019t that be beautiful?]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: It\u2019s time to stop this madness. It\u2019s time to halt the killing. It\u2019s time to end this senseless war.]\\n\\nIf you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years at a penal colony. Rough stuff. The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that. And they are here tonight.]\\n\\nTo Mark and his great mom: We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.\\n\\nAs fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally.\\n\\nThat was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did that, did I? Never forgot.\\n\\nLess than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper\u2019s perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.]\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector. When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs.] Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors- \u2014 we thought they were gone and they were saved \u2014 so those doctors had great talent. We\u2019re joined by Corey\u2019s wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. Thank you.\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: To Helen, Allison and Kaylee: Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on.] Corey was taken from us much too soon, but [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: It was love like Corey\u2019s that built our country and it\u2019s love like Corey\u2019s that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again.]\\n\\nFrom the patriots of Lexington and Concord, to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware, to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk, to the astronauts who touched the moon, [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.]\\n\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: As we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us,] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it \u2019til death.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.]\\n\\nOur ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world,] and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel. We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\\n\\nNow [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America\u2019s destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: With God\u2019s help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.]\\n\\nWe are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars, and even far beyond.\\n\\nAnd through it all, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve.] My fellow Americans, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before.] Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
