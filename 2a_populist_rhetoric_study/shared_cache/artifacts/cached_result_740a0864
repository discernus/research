      "description": "The experiment's goal of factorial analysis with statistical group comparisons is not supported by the provided corpus. The 'Recent' temporal group contains only one document (n=1), and the Experiment Specification v10.0 explicitly prohibits using groups with n<2 for comparative inferential testing. Furthermore, the total sample size of N=6 is only sufficient for 'case study analysis' according to the same specification, not for detecting the 'complex statistical relationships' outlined in the research questions.",
      "impact": "The system will fail during the statistical analysis phase because the data does not meet the minimum requirements for the requested group comparisons (e.g., ANOVA). The primary research goals are unachievable with the current corpus.",
      "fix": "To perform a factorial analysis, expand the corpus to ensure every analytical group (i.e., 'early', 'mid', 'recent') contains at least two documents, with a total sample size of at least 10 for descriptive statistics or ideally 20+ for limited inferential testing. Alternatively, revise the experiment's abstract, research questions, and expected outcomes to align with a 'case_study' analysis, removing all references to 'factorial analysis' and inferential 'statistical relationships'.",

      "description": "The experiment's machine-readable metadata specifies `analysis_type: \"case_study\"`, which directly contradicts the title, abstract, and research questions that all describe a 'Factorial Analysis' designed to find 'statistical relationships'. While the 'case_study' type is appropriate for the N=6 corpus, it misrepresents the study's stated scientific goals.",
      "impact": "There is a fundamental incoherence between the experiment's stated ambition and its technical configuration. This will lead to a failure to produce the 'Expected Outcomes' related to statistical analysis, and any reviewer would flag the discrepancy between the research design and the methodology.",
      "fix": "Align the experiment's stated goals with its configuration. Either change the research questions and abstract to reflect a qualitative case study approach, or significantly expand the corpus to support a quantitative factorial analysis and update the `analysis_type` accordingly.",

      "description": "The prose section of the corpus manifest (`corpus.md`) describes a set of nine 'Populist Discourse Dimensions' that the corpus was supposedly designed to capture. This list of dimensions does not match the nine dimensions defined in the specified analysis framework (`pdaf_v10.md`). For instance, the corpus manifest lists 'Anti-Intellectualism' and 'Simplification', which are not measured by the PDAF v10.0 framework.",
      "impact": "This discrepancy creates confusion and undermines the coherence of the research design. It suggests that the corpus was designed with a different analytical framework in mind, which could lead to a mismatch between the data's intended focus and the analytical tool's capabilities.",

      "impact": "This inconsistency in calibration guidance can lead to reduced scoring reliability, as the analytical agent is given varying levels of detail for interpreting the 0.0-1.0 scale, potentially affecting the comparability of scores across different dimensions.",
