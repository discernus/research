It's the agenda of the American people.]\\nMany of us have campaigned on the same core promises: to [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: defend\\nAmerican jobs] and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: demand fair trade for American workers]; to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: rebuild and\\nrevitalize our Nation's infrastructure]; to reduce the price of health care and\\nprescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: safe, lawful,\\nmodern, and secure]; and to pursue a foreign policy that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: puts America's\\ninterests first].\\nDONALD J. TRUMP (1ST\\nThere is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage,\\ntogether, to seize it. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning\\nfor our country].\\nThis year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us\\nthe majesty of America's mission and the power of American pride.\\nIn June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D.\\nEisenhower called the Great Crusade, the Allied liberation of Europe in\\nWorld War II. On D-day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped\\nfrom the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our\\ncivilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those incredible\\nheroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and\\nSergeant Herman Zeitchik. Please. Gentlemen, we salute you.\\nIn 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter\\nof a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of\\nthe Moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11\\nastronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. Thank you, Buzz. This year,\\nAmerican astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.\\nIn the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science,\\nredefined the middle class, and when you get down to it, there's nothing\\nanywhere in the world that can compete with America. Now we must step\\nboldly and bravely into the next chapter of this [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: great American adventure], \\nand we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An\\namazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach.\\nWe can make our communities safer, our families stronger, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: our culture\\nricher], our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous\\nthan ever before. But [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and\\nretribution], and embrace the boundless potential of [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: cooperation,\\ncompromise, and the common good].\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Together], we can [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: break decades of political stalemate]. We can [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: bridge old\\ndivisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions], and\\nunlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: The decision is ours\\nto make]. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or\\nresistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless\\ndestruction. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Tonight I ask you to choose greatness].\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Over the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and\\nhistoric speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties\\nover many decades.] In just over 2 years since the election, we have\\nlaunched an unprecedented economic boom, a boom that has rarely been\\nseen before. There's been nothing like it. We have created 5.3 million new\\njobs and, importantly, added [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: 600,000 new manufacturing jobs], something\\nwhich almost everyone said was impossible to do. But the fact is, we are\\njust getting started.\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar\\nworkers, who I promised to fight for.] They're growing faster than anyone\\nelse thought possible. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food\\nstamps. The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I\\ntook office. And we are considered, far and away, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: the hottest economy\\nanywhere in the world. Not even close].\\nUnemployment has reached the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: lowest rate in over half a century]. African\\nAmerican, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all\\nreached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans\\nwith disabilities has also reached an alltime low. More people are working\\nnow than at any time in the history of our country: 157 million people at\\nwork.\\nWe passed a [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: massive tax cut for working families] and doubled the child tax\\ncredit. We virtually ended the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: estate tax\u2014or death tax, as it is often called\u2014\\non small businesses, for ranchers, and also for family farms]. We eliminated\\nthe very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty. And to give\\ncritically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed, very importantly,\\n\\\"right to try.\\\"\\nMy administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than\\nany other administration during its entire tenure. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Companies are coming\\nback to our country in large numbers] thanks to our historic reductions in\\ntaxes and regulations. And we have unleashed a revolution in American\\nenergy. The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and\\nnatural gas anywhere in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years,\\nwe are a net exporter of energy.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: After 24 months of rapid progress], our economy is the envy of the world,\\nour military is the most powerful on Earth, by far, and [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: America is again\\nwinning each and every day]. Members of Congress: The state of our union\\nis strong.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. That sounds so good. [Laughter]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our country is vibrant, and our economy is thriving like never before.] On\\nFriday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month\\nalone, almost double the number expected. An [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: economic miracle is taking\\nplace in the United States], and [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: the only thing that can stop it are foolish\\nwars, politics, or ridiculous, partisan investigations]. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: If there is going to be\\npeace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation]. [Laughter] It\\njust doesn't work that way.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad]. This new era\\nof cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly\\nqualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, in some cases,\\nyears and years waiting. Not right. The Senate has failed to act on these\\nnominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our\\ncountry. Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have\\nalready proven that that's possible. In the last Congress, both parties came\\ntogether to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a\\nsweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms. And after four decades of\\nrejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate\\nthose who mistreat our wonderful veterans.\\nAnd just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice\\nreform. They said it couldn't be done. Last year, I heard, through friends,\\nthe story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced\\nto life in prison as a first-time nonviolent drug offender. Over the next 22\\nyears, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better\\npath. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.\\nAlice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in\\ncriminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice. She served\\nalmost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of\\nher life.\\nIn June, I commuted Alice's sentence. When I saw Alice's beautiful family\\ngreet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I\\nknew I did something right. Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific\\nwoman. Terrific. Alice, please. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we\\nalways have the power to shape our own destiny. Thank you very much,\\nAlice. Thank you very much.\\nInspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with\\nmembers of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. Big deal. It's a\\nbig deal. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and\\ndisproportionately harmed the African American community. The First Step\\nAct gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive,\\nlaw-abiding citizens.\\nAmerica is a nation that believes in redemption.\\nWe are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at\\nthe age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and\\nrelated offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30\\nBible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow\\ninmates. Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison\\nunder the First Step Act. Matthew, please. Thank you, Matthew. Welcome\\nhome.\\nNow Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: urgent national crisis]. Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund\\nour Government, protect our homeland, and [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: secure our very dangerous\\nsouthern border]. Now is the time for Congress to show the world that\\nAmerica is committed to [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: ending illegal immigration] and putting the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: ruthless\\ncoyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business].\\nAs we speak, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: large, organized caravans are on the march to the United\\nStates]. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal\\nimmigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring\\nthem up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I\\nhave ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: this tremendous onslaught].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to\\nthe safety, security, and financial well-being of all America]. We have a moral\\nduty to create an immigration system that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: protects the lives and jobs of our\\ncitizens]. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living\\nhere today who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal\\nimmigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.\\nI want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but\\nthey have to come in legally. Tonight I am asking you to defend our very\\ndangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens\\nand to our country. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: No issue better illustrates the divide between America's\\nworking class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy\\npoliticians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind\\nwalls and gates and guards.]\\nMeanwhile, [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal\\nimmigration: reduced jobs, lower wages], overburdened schools, hospitals\\nthat are so crowded you can't get in, increased crime, and a depleted social\\nsafety net. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is\\nactually very cruel].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and\\ngain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take\\nadvantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle\\nthousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them\\ninto prostitution and modern-day slavery].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that\\ncross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine,\\nand fentanyl].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American\\nStates, and they almost all come through our southern border]. Just\\nyesterday an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal\\nshooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these\\ngang members by the thousands. But until we secure our border, they're\\ngoing to keep streaming right back in.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens].\\nI've gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads and families. No\\none should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to\\nendure.\\nHere tonight is Debra Bissell. Just 3 weeks ago, Debra's parents Gerald and\\nSharon were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by\\nan illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11\\ngrandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald\\nand Sharon's granddaughter Heather and great-granddaughter Madison.\\nTo Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand. Few can understand your pain.\\nThank you. And thank you for being here. Thank you very much. I will never\\nforget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should\\nnever happen again. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Not one more American life should be lost because\\nour Nation failed to control its very dangerous border].\\nIn the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal\\naliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults,\\n30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders. We are joined tonight by\\none of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.\\nWhen Elvin\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. When Elvin was a boy, he and his\\nfamily legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.\\nAt the age of 8, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent.\\nToday, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex\\ntrafficking.\\nElvin says that \\\"If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've\\nreally done my job.\\\" Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible\\ncolleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the\\nhorror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers\\nhave been put behind bars. Thank you, Elvin. We will always support the\\nbrave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that\\nI will never abolish our heroes from ICE. Thank you.\\nMy administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end\\nthe [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: crisis on the southern border]. It includes humanitarian assistance, more\\nlaw enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable\\nchild smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the\\nvast areas between our ports of entry.\\nIn the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper\\nwall never got built. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I will get it built]. This is a smart, strategic, see-through\\nsteel barrier, not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas\\nidentified by the border agents as having the greatest need. And these\\nagents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.\\nSan Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In\\nresponse, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier\\nalmost completely ended illegal crossings.\\nThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of\\nviolent crime, one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one\\nof our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building,\\nwith a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our\\ncountry. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives. So let's work together,\\ncompromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.\\nAs we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our\\neconomic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefited more\\nfrom our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the\\nnewly created jobs last year.\\n[At this point, Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress,\\nCabinet members, and attendees in a standing ovation. ]\\nYou weren't supposed to do that. Thank you very much. Thank you very\\nmuch. [Laughter]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce\\nthan ever before.]\\n[Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress and others in\\nanother standing ovation. ]\\nDon't sit yet.

To build on our incredible economic\\nsuccess, one priority is paramount: [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: reversing decades of calamitous trade\\npolicies. So bad].\\nWe are now making it clear to China that, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: after years of targeting our\\nindustries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs\\nand wealth has come to an end]. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on\\n$250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions\\nand billions of dollars.\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and\\nrepresentatives for allowing this travesty to happen.] I have great respect for\\nPresident Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it\\nmust include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce\\nour chronic trade deficit, and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: protect American jobs]. [Applause ] Thank you.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I have\\nmet the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana,\\nNew Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by the\\nsigning of NAFTA.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For years, politicians promised them they would\\nrenegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now.]\\nOur new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA\\nand [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: deliver for American workers] like they haven't had delivered to for a\\nlong time. I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: bring\\nback our manufacturing jobs] in even greater numbers, expand American\\nagriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are\\nproudly stamped with our four beautiful words: [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Made in the U.S.A.]\\nTonight I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act\\nso that [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product,\\nwe can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that\\nthey sell to us].\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's\\ncrumbling infrastructure.] I know that Congress is eager to pass an\\ninfrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver\\nnew and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the\\ncutting-edge industries of the future. This is not an option, this is a\\nnecessity.\\nThe next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: lower the cost\\nof health care and prescription drugs] and to protect patients with\\npreexisting conditions. Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in\\n2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.\\nBut we must do more. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: It's unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more\\nthan people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the\\nexact same place. This is wrong, this is unfair, and together, we will stop it,\\nand we'll stop it fast.]\\nI am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: problem of\\nglobal freeloading] and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: delivers fairness and price transparency for\\nAmerican patients], finally. We should also require drug companies,\\ninsurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster\\ncompetition and bring costs way down.\\nNo force in history has done more to advance the human condition than\\nAmerican freedom. In recent years, we have made remarkable progress in\\nthe fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a\\nonce-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and\\nRepublicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV\\nepidemic in the United States within 10 years. We have made incredible\\nstrides. Incredible. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.\\nTonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: all Americans\\ncan get behind]: the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the\\ngallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every\\nbirthday\u2014[applause ]. Hi, Grace. [Laughter] Every birthday since she was 4,\\nGrace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital. She did\\nnot know that one day she might be a patient herself. That's what\\nhappened.\\nLast year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began\\nradiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and\\nraised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace\\ncompleted treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered\u2014they loved\\nher; they still love her\u2014with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that\\nread: \\\"Last day of chemo.\\\" Thank you very much, Grace. You are a great\\ninspiration to everyone in this room. Thank you very much.\\nMany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My\\nbudget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this\\ncritical lifesaving research.\\nTo help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice\\nfor Americans' children. I am also proud to be the first President to include\\nin my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave so that every new\\nparent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.\\nAudience member. Yes!\\nThe President. There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a\\nmother holding her infant child than [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: the chilling displays our Nation saw in\\nrecent days]. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage\\nof legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb\\nmoments from birth. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia\\nwhere he stated he would execute a baby after birth. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: These are living, feeling,\\nbeautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their\\ndreams with the world.]\\nTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass\\nlegislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in\\nthe mother's womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes\\ninnocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children\u2014born\\nand unborn\u2014are made in the holy image of God.\\nThe final part of my agenda is to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: protect American security]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Over the last 2\\nyears, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military], with $700\\nbillion last year and $716 billion this year.\\nWe are also getting [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: other nations to pay their fair share. Finally.] [Applause ]\\nFinally. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by\\nfriends of ours, members of NATO]. But now we have secured, over the last\\ncouple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending\\nfrom our NATO Allies. They said it couldn't be done.\\nAs part of our military buildup, the United States is developing a state-of-\\nthe-art missile defense system.\\nUnder my administration, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: we will never apologize for advancing America's\\ninterests].\\nFor example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with\\nRussia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability. While\\nwe followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Russia repeatedly\\nviolated its terms. It's been going on for many years]. That is why I\\nannounced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the\\nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps\u2014\\n[applause ]\u2014we really have no choice. Perhaps we can negotiate a different\\nagreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't, in which case, we\\nwill outspend and outinnovate all others by far.\\nAs part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace\\non the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing\\nhas stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15\\nmonths. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would\\nright now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea]. Much work\\nremains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.\\nChairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.\\nTwo weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate\\nGovernment of Venezuela and its new President, Juan Guaid\u00f3. We stand\\nwith the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom, and we\\ncondemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: whose socialist policies have\\nturned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state\\nof abject poverty and despair].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt\\nsocialism in our country].\\nAudience members. Boo!\\nThe President. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: America was founded on liberty and independence and not\\nGovernment coercion, domination, and control]. We are born free, and we\\nwill stay free.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a\\nsocialist country].\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have\\nfor many years, is in the Middle East. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our approach is based on principled\\nrealism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield\\nprogress]. For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of\\nIsrael and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.\\nOur brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19\\nyears. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given\\ntheir lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We\\nhave spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.\\nAs a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Great\\nnations do not fight endless wars]. When I took office, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: ISIS controlled more\\nthan 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria, just 2 years ago]. Today, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we have\\nliberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty\\nmonsters]. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it\\nis time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.\\nI have also accelerated our negotiations to reach\u2014if possible\u2014a political\\nsettlement in Afghanistan. The opposing side is also very happy to be\\nnegotiating. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor. And thanks to\\ntheir bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this\\nlong and bloody conflict.\\nIn Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a\\nnumber of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in\\nthese negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop's presence and\\nfocus on counterterrorism. And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.\\nWe do not know whether we'll achieve an agreement, but we do know that,\\nafter two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. And\\nthe other side would like to do the same thing. It's time.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and\\nwill to defend our people]. Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the\\nUSS Cole. And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that\\nattack.\\nWe are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy\\nSeaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom,\\nwe vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. Thank you, Tom.\\nMy administration has acted decisively to confront the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: world's leading state\\nsponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran]. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: It is a radical regime. They do\\nbad, bad things.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear\\nweapons], I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear\\ndeal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by\\nus on a country.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants \\\"Death to America\\\"\\nand threatens genocide against the Jewish people]. We must never ignore\\nthe [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: vile poison of anti-Semitism] or those who spread its venomous creed.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it\\noccurs].\\nJust months ago, 11 Jewish Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-\\nSemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer\\nTimothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing\\ndown the killer. And he was very successful. Timothy has just had his 12th\\nsurgery, and he is going in for many more. But he made the trip to be here\\nwith us tonight. Officer Matson, please. Thank you. We are forever grateful.\\nThank you very much.\\nTonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet. He arrived\\nat the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly\\nescape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived\\nthe Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday.\\n[Audience members sang \\\"Happy Birthday.\\\" ]\\nThe President. [Laughter]\\nPittsburgh, PA, resident Judah Samet. Thank you! [Laughter]\\nThe President. They wouldn't do that for me, Judah. [Laughter]\\nJudah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago,\\nafter 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put\\non a train and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly, the train\\nscreeched to a very strong halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced\\nfor the absolute worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: \\\"It's the\\nAmericans! It's the Americans!\\\" [Applause ] Thank you.\\nA second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a\\nprisoner at Dachau. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a\\ncattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. \\\"To me,\\\" Joshua recalls,\\n\\\"the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down\\nfrom the sky.\\\" They came down from Heaven. I began this evening by\\nhonoring three soldiers who fought on D-day in the Second World War. One\\nof them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year\\nafter he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the\\nAmerican soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the\\nAmericans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.\\nAlmost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery\\ntonight, seated side by side, here in the home of American freedom.\\nHerman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated.\\nThank you very much. [Applause ] Thank you.\\nWhen American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English\\nChannel in the early hours of D-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18\\nand 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle\\nin the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They\\ndid not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to\\nprevail. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn].\\nWhy did they do it? [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: They did it for America. They did it for us]. Everything\\nthat has come since\u2014our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of\\nscience and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice\\n\u2014all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision\\nof the Americans who came before.\\nThink of this Capitol. Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before\\nyou voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways and defeat\\nfascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.\\nHere tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You\\nhave come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of\\nHawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona;\\nfrom the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history].\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the\\nmen and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us. Our\\nmost thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still\\nawait. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to\\ndream.]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether\\nwe dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we squander our great\\ninheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans]. We do\\nthe incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.\\nThis is the time to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: reignite the American imagination]. This is the time to\\nsearch for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star. This is\\nthe time to [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us\\ntogether as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots]. This is our future, our fate,\\nand our choice to make. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I am asking you to choose greatness.] No matter\\nthe trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: together].\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We must keep America first in our hearts], we must keep freedom alive in\\nour souls, and we must always keep faith in [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: America's destiny that one\\nNation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the\\nglory among all the nations of the world].\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.
