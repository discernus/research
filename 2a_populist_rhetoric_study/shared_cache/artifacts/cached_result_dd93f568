      "description": "The experiment's prose section describes analytical goals that are not achievable with the provided corpus size. The methodology specifies 'temporal pattern analysis', 'strategic tension analysis', and 'speech context analysis' implying comparative inferential statistics. However, the corpus contains only 6 documents (N=6).",
      "impact": "According to the Discernus v10.0 experiment specification, a sample size of N=4-9 is only suitable for 'Case study analysis, qualitative patterns, individual document insights' and is insufficient for the inferential statistical tests implied in the experiment's narrative sections. The analysis will be limited to descriptive statistics and qualitative observations, which contradicts the stated expected outcomes of quantified statistical differences.",
      "fix": "Revise the experiment's Abstract, Research Questions, and Expected Outcomes to align with a case study methodology, focusing on descriptive and qualitative findings. Remove language implying inferential statistical testing (e.g., 'statistical tests for populist discourse patterns', 'statistical differences between speech contexts'). Alternatively, expand the corpus to meet the minimum sample size requirements for the desired statistical analysis (e.g., N>=20 for limited inferential testing).",
