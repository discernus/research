The framework's internal documentation specifies a 0.0-2.0 scoring range for dimensions, but the required output format specifies a 0.0-1.0 range. To comply with the final output schema and the prohibition on mathematical calculations, scores were assessed directly on the 0.0-1.0 scale. The provided text is a strong and clear example of populist discourse, allowing for high confidence in the scoring and evidence extraction."
