    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the explicit rhetorical strategies present in the speech. The document, a State of the Union address, has a notably more unifying and formal tone than a campaign rally speech, which influences the scores. Dimensions like 'anti_pluralist_exclusion' and 'authenticity_vs_political_class' are scored very low as the speech's overt theme is bipartisan cooperation and presidential leadership, rather than anti-establishment posturing or delegitimizing domestic opponents. Conversely, themes of national restoration, homogenous unity, and nationalist exclusion via border security are highly intense and salient."
