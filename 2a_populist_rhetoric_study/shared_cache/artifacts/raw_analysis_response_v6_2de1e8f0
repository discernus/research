    "analysis_notes": "The analysis was conducted on the full text of the inaugural address. The speech exhibits extremely high levels of populist rhetoric across most dimensions, making scoring straightforward. The rhetoric is explicit and forms the core of the speech's argument, leading to high scores for both intensity and salience in most categories. The one exception is 'anti_pluralist_exclusion', which is not explicitly articulated, though it can be inferred from the overall tone."
