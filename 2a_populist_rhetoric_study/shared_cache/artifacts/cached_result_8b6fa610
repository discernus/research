      "description": "The experiment design requests comparative statistical analyses across temporal periods ('Early', 'Mid', 'Recent') and speech types ('Inaugural', 'Joint Session', 'State of the Union'), but several analytical groups have a sample size of n=1. Specifically, the 'Recent' period group, the 'inaugural_address' speech type group, and the 'joint_session_address' speech type group each contain only one document. This is insufficient for the requested statistical comparisons.",
      "impact": "The experiment is underpowered for the requested inferential statistical analysis. Execution will be blocked because comparative tests like ANOVA or t-tests cannot be performed on groups with fewer than two members, as stated in the Discernus Experiment Specification v10.0.",
      "fix": "Either re-scope the experiment to use descriptive statistics and qualitative comparisons for the n=1 groups, designating them as baselines, or expand the corpus to include at least two documents for every group intended for comparative statistical analysis.",

      "description": "The human-readable 'Populist Discourse Dimensions' section within 'corpus.md' lists a set of dimensions (e.g., 'Anti-Establishment Rhetoric', 'Mobilization Appeals', 'Simplification') that are inconsistent with the dimensions defined in the 'pdaf_v10.md' framework (e.g., 'crisis_restoration_narrative', 'popular_sovereignty_claims', 'authenticity_vs_political_class').",
      "impact": "This discrepancy does not prevent execution, as the machine-readable framework file is the authoritative source for analysis. However, it creates significant documentation confusion, potentially misleading any researcher who consults the corpus manifest to understand the analytical model.",
      "fix": "Update the 'Populist Discourse Dimensions' descriptive section in 'corpus.md' to accurately reflect the nine dimensions specified in the 'pdaf_v10.md' framework file.",
