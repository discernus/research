The analysis focused on identifying and scoring populist discourse elements across three core dimensions: Core Anchors, Mechanism Anchors, and Boundary Anchors. Evidence was extracted for each scoring dimension, with confidence levels reflecting the clarity and directness of the textual support. A comprehensive review of the text was performed to identify semantic concepts aligned with the framework's markers."
