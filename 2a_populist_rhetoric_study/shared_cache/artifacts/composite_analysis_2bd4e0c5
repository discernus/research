I return to this chamber tonight to report that [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: America\u2019s momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back. And the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.]\\n\\nThe American Dream is unstoppable, and [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again.] Never been anything like it. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an Electoral College victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.]\\n\\nNow, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction \u2014 in fact it\u2019s an astonishing record, 27-point swing \u2014 the most ever. Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, a 41-point jump. Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive Orders and taken more than 400 Executive Actions, a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it.] [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it.] In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, it\u2019s our presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation. By many.\\n\\nAnd what makes it even more impressive, is that you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? I don\u2019t know about that list but we\u2019ll take it. [CRISIS_RESToration_NARRATIVE: Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border,] and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: invasion of our country,] and what a job they\u2019ve done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way.\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history,] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?]\\n\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won\u2019t do it no matter what, five, five times I\u2019ve been up here. It\u2019s very sad, and it just shouldn\u2019t be this way.]\\n\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation?] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation?] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Let\u2019s work together and let\u2019s truly make America great again.] Every day my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future America deserves and we\u2019re doing it. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: This is a time for big dreams and bold action.]\\n\\nUpon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: ridiculous green new scam.] I withdrew from the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying.] I withdrew from the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: corrupt World Health Organization,] and I also withdrew from the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: We ended all of Biden\u2019s environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable.] And importantly, we ended the [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: last administration\u2019s insane electric vehicle mandate,] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction.] To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.\\n\\nWe ordered all federal workers to return to the office. [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me.] How did that work out? Not too good, not too good. And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America, it\u2019s back. And two days ago I signed an order [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: making English the official language of the United States of America.]\\n\\nI renamed the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America.] And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again. Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We\u2019ve ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.]\\n\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender.] You should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you, thank you very much. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools] and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: there are only two genders, male and female.]\\n\\nI also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women\u2019s sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton\u2019s face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she\u2019s never seen before. She\u2019s never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding.]\\n\\nAnd if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women\u2019s boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: It\u2019s demeaning for women, and it\u2019s very bad for our country. We\u2019re not going to put up with it any longer.]\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now because of us sweeping the entire world,] common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, never going to let that happen. Among my very highest priorities is to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they\u2019ve never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they\u2019re not sure.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As president, I\u2019m fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control.] The egg prices out of control. And we are working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that, you inherited a total mess from that administration. Do a good job. A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We are opening up many of those power plants right now.] And frankly, we have never seen anything like it.\\n\\nThat\u2019s why, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency.] As you\u2019ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It\u2019s called drill, baby, drill.\\n\\nMy administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. It\u2019s never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It\u2019s all set to go. The permitting has gotten and later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.\\n\\nTo further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.]\\n\\nAnd to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you\u2019re working very hard. [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: He didn\u2019t need this, he didn\u2019t need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it I believe. They just don\u2019t want to admit that.]\\n\\nJust listen to some of the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens, $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma, $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: This is real.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab \u201cSesame Street\u201d in the Middle East, it\u2019s a program, $20 million for program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee \u2014 headed up and we know she\u2019s involved just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City, real estate developers done very well. $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia, $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda, $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we\u2019re doing? Should use it ourselves. A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. The most ever paid, nothing even like it.] Under the Trump administration, all of these [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: scams and there are far worse,] but I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to talk about them, they\u2019re so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.]\\n\\nAnd we\u2019ve taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We\u2019re going to. We\u2019re also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on.]\\n\\nBelieve it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don\u2019t know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we\u2019re searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You\u2019re going to find it. But [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country,] 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.\\n\\nIncluding, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229, one person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age \u2014 more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. But we\u2019re going to find out where that money is going, and it\u2019s not going to be pretty, by [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.]\\n\\nAnd today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It\u2019s about time. And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years \u2014 balance the federal budget, we\u2019re gonna balance it.\\n\\nWith that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It\u2019s like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won\u2019t have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they\u2019ve made, you wouldn\u2019t want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They\u2019ll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out.] Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.\\n\\nSo [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you\u2019ve allowed to destroy our country,] we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people. They\u2019re going to pay a lot of money, and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we\u2019re going to reduce our debt with that money.]\\n\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America\u2019s potential in every possible way.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America\u2019s potential in every possible way.] The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead, take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again.] [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again.] [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately.]\\n\\n[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Because we are draining the swamp, it\u2019s very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Because we are draining the swamp, it\u2019s very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.] And the next phase of our plan to deliver the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: greatest economy in history] is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They\u2019re in there, they\u2019re waiting for you to vote. And I\u2019m sure that the people on my right \u2014 I don\u2019t mean the Republican right, but my right, right here \u2014 [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don\u2019t believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I\u2019m doing you a big favor by telling you that.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I don\u2019t believe the people will ever vote you into office.] But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut. A very, very big part of our plan, we had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We\u2019re seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. I\u2019m calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.]\\n\\nAnd I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. Oh, and by the way, we\u2019re going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody\u2019s ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made like never seen. That\u2019s a combination of the election win and tariffs. It\u2019s a beautiful word, isn\u2019t it? That that along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It\u2019s going to boom. Spoke to the majors today. All three, the top people and they\u2019re so excited. In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world. And this has taken place since a great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. In addition, as part of our tax cuts, [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing.] And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025.\\n\\nAnd it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term. And [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: if you don\u2019t make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it\u2019s our turn to start using them against those other countries.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It\u2019s very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China\u2019s average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea\u2019s average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea.]\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: But that\u2019s what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was.] And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn\u2019t want to be accused of April Fool\u2019s Day. That\u2019s what one day would cost us, a lot of money, but we\u2019re going to do it in April. I\u2019m a very superstitious person. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That\u2019s reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn\u2019t do anything about it because there was so much money. They couldn\u2019t do anything about it. We\u2019ve been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer.] Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we have very large deficits with both of them.] But even more importantly, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: they\u2019ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families. Nobody\u2019s ever seen anything like it.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico, have hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States, will not be doing that any longer. We\u2019re not going to do it any longer.]\\n\\nThanks to our America First policies we\u2019re putting into place, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks.] The combination of the election and our economic policies that people love. SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn\u2019t have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me, said, I cannot spend it fast enough, it\u2019s got to be much higher than that. I believe they\u2019ll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world\u2019s most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount \u2014 97% of the market \u2014 announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the U.S.A. And we\u2019re not giving them any money.\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn\u2019t mean a thing. They take our money and they don\u2019t spend it.] All that meant to them. We\u2019re giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn\u2019t want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they\u2019re building. And many other companies are coming. We don\u2019t have to give them money, we just want to protect our businesses and our people, and they will come because they won\u2019t have to pay tariffs if they build in America. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: So it\u2019s very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act and whatever\u2019s left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.]\\n\\nA new trade policy will also be [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: great for the American farmer.] I love the farmer. We\u2019ll now be selling it to our home market in the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they\u2019re really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They\u2019re uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.]\\n\\nThe tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period, we had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said, just bear with me. And they did, they did. You really have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The problem with it was that Biden didn\u2019t enforce it.] He didn\u2019t enforce it. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great. But Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers.] But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you too.\\n\\nAnd I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel because [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: if we don\u2019t have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don\u2019t have a military and frankly we just won\u2019t have a country very long.] Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Stories like Jeff\u2019s remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: They\u2019re about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again.] And it\u2019s happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There\u2019ll be a little disturbance, but we\u2019re okay with that. It won\u2019t be much. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: No you\u2019re not, oh. And look, look where Biden took us, it\u2019s very low, the lowest we\u2019ve ever been.]\\n\\nJeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, her very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States. Melania\u2019s work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation\u2019s future leaders as they enter the workforce.\\n\\nOur first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive. Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Ladies Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education, become a teacher. And Allison Berry, who became a victim of an illicit, deepfake image produced by a peer. With Allison\u2019s help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\\n\\nAnd thank you to John Thune and the Senate. Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. Just terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I\u2019m going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: There\u2019s nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.] That\u2019s great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.\\n\\nBut if we truly care about protecting America\u2019s children, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: no step is more crucial than securing America\u2019s borders.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden\u2019s insane and very dangerous open border policies.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden\u2019s insane and very dangerous open border policies.] They are now strongly embedded in our country. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But we are getting them out and getting them out fast.] And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you, and Paul and Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they\u2019ve all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.\\n\\nLast year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden\u2019s open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden\u2019s open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration.] He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken\u2019s beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.\\n\\nLast year, I told Laken\u2019s grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That\u2019s why [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. Very strong, powerful act. It\u2019s called the Laken Riley Act.] So, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. Thank you very much.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.] And [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded.] Thank you. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Joe Biden didn\u2019t just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody\u2019s ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed.] Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.]\\n\\nHere tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis\u2019 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.]\\n\\nThe death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God\u2019s creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.\\n\\nAlexis. Moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken\u2019s murders were members of the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua.] Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that\u2019s not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or, if they are too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country because we don\u2019t want them to come back ever.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration.]\\n\\nWith us this evening is a warrior on the frontline of that battle. Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz, great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. Doesn\u2019t sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed to great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. We honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation. posing a grave threat to our national security.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The cartels are waging war in America, and it\u2019s time for America to wage war on the cartels.] Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. But [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they\u2019ve done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the U.S.A. They\u2019re going to stop it.]\\n\\nI have sent Congress a detailed funding request, laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: largest deportation operation in American history.] Larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law.] So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you\u2019re going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let\u2019s get it to me. I\u2019ll sign it so fast you won\u2019t even believe it.\\n\\nAnd [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns.] In recent years, [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.] Starting at the FBI and the DOJ, Pam. Good luck. Kash, wherever you may be. Good luck, good luck. Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Gonna to do a great job. Kash. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Kash.\\n\\nThey have already started very strong. They\u2019re going to do a fantastic job. You\u2019re going to be very proud of them. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We\u2019re also once again giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they show dearly deserve.] They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job. But we\u2019re going to make it less dangerous. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The problem is the bad guys don\u2019t respect the law, but they\u2019re starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.]\\n\\nThis also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers. So I have no choice.\\n\\nOne year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: A vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests -- and they were rough arrests, too. He was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests, and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them.] I attended Officer Tiller\u2019s service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow\u2019s name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Thank you very much Stephanie. Thank you very much.\\n\\nStephanie, we\u2019re going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero. New York\u2019s finest. And [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we\u2019re going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we\u2019re going to do it fast. Gotta stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats.]\\n\\nI\u2019ve already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And tonight, I\u2019m asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I\u2019m also asking for a new crime bill getting tougher on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America\u2019s police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed.] They don\u2019t want to be killed. We\u2019re not going to let them be killed.\\n\\nJoining us to the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is D.J. Daniel. He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. But in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. And D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. Actually, a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight, D.J., we\u2019re going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States secret Service. Thank you, D.J.\\n\\nD.J.\u2019s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again,] chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. With a name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong.] As an example, not long ago \u2014 and you can\u2019t even believe these numbers \u2014 one in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it\u2019s one in 36. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: There\u2019s something wrong. One in 36. Think of that. So, we\u2019re going to find out what it is,] and there\u2019s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby. Good luck. It\u2019s a very important job. Thank you.\\n\\nMy administration is also working to protect children from [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: toxic ideologies in our schools.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter\u2019s school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl.

Thank you.\\n\\nStories like this are why, shortly after taking office, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology.] I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: sexual mutilation of our youth.] And now, I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie.] And [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Because we\u2019re getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it\u2019s already out, and it\u2019s out of our society. We don\u2019t want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It\u2019s gone. It\u2019s gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don\u2019t we? Don\u2019t we feel better?] Our service members won\u2019t be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: They will fight for our country] and Pete, congratulations, secretary of defense. And he\u2019s not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.\\n\\nI am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: What a difference. And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn\u2019t recruit anywhere. We couldn\u2019t recruit. Now we\u2019re having the best results just about that we\u2019ve ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It\u2019s really a beautiful thing to see.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: People love our country again. It\u2019s very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it\u2019s a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.]\\n\\nWe\u2019re joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason\u2019s father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy, when he was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete \u2014 a really good athlete, they say. A brilliant student with a 4.46 \u2014 that\u2019s good \u2014 GPA and his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\\n\\nAnd Jason, that\u2019s a very big deal getting in. That\u2019s a hard one to get into. But I\u2019m pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. You\u2019ll soon be joining the Corps of Cadets.\\n\\nThank you. Jason, you\u2019re going to be on the Long Gray Line, Jason. As commander in chief, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As a first step, I\u2019m asking Congress to fund a state of the art \u201cgolden dome\u201d missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A.]\\n\\nRonald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn\u2019t there. Not even close. But now we have the technology. It\u2019s incredible, actually.\\n\\nAnd other place \u2014 they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right? Kim. Right. They should have it too. So I want to thank you, but it\u2019s a very, very important. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we\u2019re going to protect our citizens like never before.]\\n\\nTo boost our defense industrial base, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding.] And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We used to make so many ships. We don\u2019t make them anymore very much, but we\u2019re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.]\\n\\nTo further enhance our national security, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it.]\\n\\nJust today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.]\\n\\nBut it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work.\\n\\nThey paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country\u2019s history if you bring it up to modern-day costs. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: It was given away by the Carter administration for $1.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But that agreement has been violated very severely.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We didn\u2019t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.]\\n\\nNow we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Marco has been amazing, and he\u2019s going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman. And I feel very certain, so let\u2019s assume we got 100 votes. And I\u2019m either very, very happy about that or I\u2019m very concerned about it.\\n\\nBut he\u2019s already proven \u2014 I mean, he\u2019s a great gentleman. He\u2019s respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He\u2019s going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you. He\u2019s doing a great job. Great job.\\n\\nAnd I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.]\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: We need Greenland for national security and even international security.] And we\u2019re working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security. And I think we\u2019re going to get it. One way or the other, we\u2019re going to get it.\\n\\nWe will keep you safe. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We will make you rich.] And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.\\n\\nIt\u2019s a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.\\n\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.]\\n\\nAnd I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly, over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.\\n\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That\u2019s how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.]\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they\u2019re all in our hearts tonight. I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. It\u2019s happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.]\\n\\nIn the Middle East, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we\u2019re bringing back our hostages from Gaza.] In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords. And now we\u2019re going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.\\n\\nA lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven\u2019t been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. A rough neighborhood actually.\\n\\nI\u2019m also working tirelessly to end the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: savage conflict in Ukraine.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine\u2019s defense, with no security, with no way. Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say, \u201cPocahontas says yes.\u201d]\\n\\n2000 people are being killed every single week. More than that. They are Russian young people. They\u2019re Ukrainian young people. They\u2019re not Americans. But [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I want it to stop.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They\u2019ve spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending.]\\n\\nAnd [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: we\u2019ve spent perhaps $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby. That\u2019s what happened. And they\u2019ve spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us. And they don\u2019t. But we\u2019re getting along very well with them. And lots of good things are happening.]\\n\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It\u2019s hard to believe that they wouldn\u2019t have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let\u2019s equalize. You got to be equal to us. That didn\u2019t happen.]\\n\\nEarlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The letter reads: \u2018Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\u201d he said. \u201cMy team and I stand ready to work under President Trump\u2019s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\u201d\\n\\nI appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we\u2019ve had serious discussion with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Wouldn\u2019t that be beautiful? Wouldn\u2019t that be beautiful? Wouldn\u2019t that be beautiful?]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: It\u2019s time to stop this madness. It\u2019s time to halt the killing. It\u2019s time to end this senseless war.]\\n\\nIf you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years at a penal colony. Rough stuff. The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that. And they are here tonight.]\\n\\nTo Mark and his great mom: We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.\\n\\nAs fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally.\\n\\nThat was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did that, did I? Never forgot.\\n\\nLess than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper\u2019s perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.]\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector. When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs.] Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors- \u2014 we thought they were gone and they were saved \u2014 so those doctors had great talent. We\u2019re joined by Corey\u2019s wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. Thank you.\\n\\n[AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: To Helen, Allison and Kaylee: Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on.] Corey was taken from us much too soon, but [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: It was love like Corey\u2019s that built our country and it\u2019s love like Corey\u2019s that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before.]\\n\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again.]\\n\\nFrom the patriots of Lexington and Concord, to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware, to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk, to the astronauts who touched the moon, [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.]\\n\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: As we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people.] [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us,] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it \u2019til death.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.]\\n\\nOur ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world,] and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel. We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\\n\\nNow [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America\u2019s destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: With God\u2019s help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.]\\n\\nWe are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars, and even far beyond.\\n\\nAnd through it all, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve.] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve.] My fellow Americans, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before.] Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
