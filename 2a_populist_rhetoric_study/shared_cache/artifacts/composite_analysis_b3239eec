TRUMP\\nAddress to a Joint Session of Congress\\nFebruary 5, 2019\\n\\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the\\nFirst Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: Less than 1 year\\nhas passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic Chamber, to\\nspeak [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: on behalf of the American people] and to address [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams]. That night, our new administration had\\nalready taken very swift action. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: A new tide of optimism was already\\nsweeping across our land.] Each day since, we have gone forward with a\\nclear vision and a righteous mission: to [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: make America great again] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: for all\\nAmericans].\\nOver the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved\\nextraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected and others\\nwe could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and\\nthe pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But\\nthrough it all, we have seen the [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: beauty of America's soul] and the [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: steel in\\nAmerica's spine].\\n\\nEach test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are and\\nshow us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to\\nthe rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a\\ntotally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a\\nhail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert,\\nwho is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of\\nthe first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey.\\nThrough 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and\\ndeep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank\\nyou very much.\\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He's here with us\\nalso. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped\\nat a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires. To\\neveryone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the\\nVirgin Islands\u2014everywhere\u2014we are with you, we love you, and [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: we always\\nwill pull through together, always]. Thank you to David and the brave people\\nof California. Thank you very much, David. Great job.\\nSome trials over the past year touched this Chamber very personally. With\\nus tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House, a guy\\nwho took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work 3\u00bd months later: the\\nlegend from Louisiana\u2014[laughter]\u2014Congressman Steve Scalise. [Applause ] I\\nthink they like you, Steve. [Laughter] We are incredibly grateful for the\\nheroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the\\ndoctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many\\nothers; some in this room. In the aftermath\u2014[applause ]\u2014yes. Yes.\\nIn the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: not as\\nRepublicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people]. But [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: it is\\nnot enough to come together only in times of tragedy]. Tonight I call upon [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: all\\nof us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to\\nsummon the unity we need to deliver for the people]. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: This is really the key.\\nThese are the people we were elected to serve.] [Applause ] Thank you. Over\\nthe last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: no people on\\nEarth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans]. If there is a\\nmountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there's a challenge,\\nwe tame it. If there's an opportunity, we seize it. So let's begin tonight by\\nrecognizing that the [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: state of our Union is strong because our people are\\nstrong]. And [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America].\\nSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000\\nnew jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: After years and\\nyears of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.] Unemployment\\nclaims have hit a 45-year low. And something I'm very proud of: African\\nAmerican unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And\\nHispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in\\nhistory.\\nSmall-business confidence is at an alltime high. The stock market has\\nsmashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion and more in value in\\njust this short period of time. The great news for Americans: 401(k),\\nretirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the\\nroof.\\nAnd just as [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I promised the American people] from this podium 11 months\\nago, we enacted the [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history]. Our\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small\\nbusiness]. To lower tax rates for hard-working Americans, we nearly doubled\\nthe standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a\\nmarried couple is completely tax free. We also doubled the child tax credit.\\nA typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by\\n$2,000, slashing their tax bill in half. In April, this will be the last time you\\nwill ever file under the [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: old and very broken system], and [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: millions of\\nAmericans will have more take-home pay starting next month\u2014a lot more].\\nWe eliminated an [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making\\nless than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply\\nbecause they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans]. We\\nrepealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is\\nnow gone, thank heavens. [Applause ] Great job.\\nWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21\\npercent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else\\nanywhere in the world. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: These changes alone are estimated to increase\\naverage family income by more than $4,000, a lot of money.] Small\\nbusinesses have also received a massive tax cut and can now deduct 20\\npercent of their business income.\\nHere tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing,\\na small, beautiful business in Ohio. They've just finished the best year in\\ntheir 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises,\\nhiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.\\nIt's a good feeling.\\nOne of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an\\nall-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job\\nduring the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained\\nto become a welder. Like many hard-working Americans, Corey plans to\\ninvest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education.\\nCorey, please stand. And he's a great welder. [Laughter] I was told that by\\nthe man that owns that company that's doing so well. So congratulations,\\nCorey.\\nSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax\\ncut bonuses, many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker.\\nAnd it's getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it\\nplans to invest a total of $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000\\nworkers. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion\\ninvestment in the United States\u2014just a little while ago.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: This, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better\\ntime to start living the American Dream.] So [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: to every citizen watching at\\nhome tonight, no matter where you've been or where you've come from, this\\nis your time]. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in\\nAmerica, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: together,\\nwe can achieve absolutely anything].\\nTonight I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have and\\nwhat kind of a nation we are going to be. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: All of us, together, as one team,\\none people, and one American family can do anything.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: We all share the\\nsame home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great\\nAmerican flag.] [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Together, we are rediscovering the American way.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: In\\nAmerica, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy,\\nare the center of American life.] The motto is, \\\"In God We Trust.\\\" And we\\ncelebrate [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who\\ndeserve our total and unwavering support].\\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California,\\nwho noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans\\nDay. He decided all by himself to change that and started a movement that\\nhas now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston, a\\njob well done. Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic\\nduty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something\\nvery special, that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all\\nyou've done, Preston. Thank you very much.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Preston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us of\\nwhy we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge\\nof Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.]\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Americans love their country, and they deserve a Government that shows\\nthem the same love and loyalty in return.] For the last year, we have sought\\nto [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government].\\nWorking with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the\\nConstitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice and\\nmore circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our\\ncountry. We are totally defending our Second Amendment and have taken\\nhistoric actions to protect religious liberty.\\nAnd we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice\\nin their health care decisions. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed,\\nthe landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: my administration\\nhas already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our\\nveterans the care they deserve]. And we are hiring talented people who love\\nour vets as much as we do. And [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I will not stop until our veterans are\\nproperly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very\\nbeginning of this great journey].\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: All Americans deserve accountability and respect], and that's what we are\\ngiving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. So tonight [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: I call on\\nCongress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward\\ngood workers and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public\\ntrust or fail the American people].\\nIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more\\nregulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our\\ncountry. We have ended the [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: war on American energy], and we have ended\\nthe war on beautiful, clean coal. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We are now, very proudly, an exporter of\\nenergy to the world.] In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled\\nAmerica's great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City\\nrevving its engines again. And that's what's happening. Many car companies\\nare now building and expanding plants in the United States, [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: something we\\nhaven't seen for decades. It's all coming back].\\nVery soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our\\ncountry. [CRISIS_RESToration_NARRATIVE: This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For\\nmany years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are\\nroaring back. They're coming back. They want to be where the action is.\\nThey want to be in the United States of America. That's where they want to\\nbe.]\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Exciting progress is happening every single day]. To speed access to\\nbreakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year, the FDA\\napproved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever\\nbefore in our country's history. We also believe that patients with terminal\\nconditions and terminal illness should have access to experimental\\ntreatment immediately that could potentially save their lives. People who\\nare terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a\\ncure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It's time for Congress\\nto give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. [Applause ]\\nRight?\\n[ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.\\nIn many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the\\nUnited States. And it's very, very unfair.] That is why I have directed my\\nadministration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top\\npriorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially. Watch.\\n[NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals\\nthat sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs,\\nand our wealth]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we're getting it back so\\nfast. The era of economic surrender is totally over.] From now on, we expect\\ntrading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal.\\nWe will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they'll be\\ngood ones, but they'll be fair. And we will protect [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: American workers and\\nAmerican intellectual property] through strong enforcement of our trade\\nrules.\\nAs we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: our crumbling\\ninfrastructure]. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: America is a nation of builders.] We built the Empire State\\nBuilding in just 1 year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to\\nget a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: I am asking\\nboth parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern\\ninfrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve].\\nTonight I'm calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5\\ntrillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so\\ndesperately needs. [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering\\nwith State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into\\nprivate sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.] And\\nwe can do it.\\nAny bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it\\ndown to no more than 2 years and perhaps even 1. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: Together, we can\\nreclaim our great building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads,\\nbridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land.] And [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: we will\\ndo it with American heart and American hands and American grit.] [ECONOMIC_POPULIST_APPEALS: We want\\nevery American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every\\nchild to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be\\nproud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from\\nwelfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to\\nprosperity.]\\nAs tax cuts create new jobs, let's invest in workforce development, and let's\\ninvest in job training, which we need so badly. Let's open great vocational\\nschools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full\\npotential. And let's support working families by supporting paid family\\nleave.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As America regains its strength], opportunity must be extended to all\\ncitizens. That is why this year, we will embark on reforming our prisons to\\nhelp former inmates, who have served their time, get a second chance at\\nlife.\\n[MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be\\nhelped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American\\nworkers and American families.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: For decades, open borders have allowed\\ndrugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've\\nallowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages\\nagainst the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of\\nmany innocent lives.]\\nHere tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy\\nCuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage\\ndaughters\u2014Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens\u2014were close friends on Long\\nIsland. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th birthday\u2014such a\\nhappy time it should have been\u2014neither of them came home. These two\\nprecious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their\\nhometown.\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and\\nNisa's murders.] Many of these gang members took advantage of [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: glaring\\nloopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien\\nminors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school]. Evelyn, Elizabeth,\\nFreddy, and Robert: Tonight everyone in this chamber is praying for you.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Everyone in America is grieving for you.] Please stand. Thank you very much.\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you.\\nWe love you. Thank you.]\\nWhile we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make\\nsure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain. Tonight [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: I am\\ncalling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed\\nMS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country.] We have\\nproposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our\\nICE and Border Patrol agents\u2014these are great people; these are great,\\ngreat people\u2014that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this\\ncan never happen again.\\nThe United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do\\nmore than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the\\nstruggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: as President of\\nthe United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant\\nconcern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and\\nAmerica's forgotten communities]. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: I want our youth to grow up to achieve\\ngreat things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.]\\nSo tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both\\nparties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every\\nbackground, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of\\nevery elected official in this Chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect\\ntheir safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the\\nAmerican Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one\\nleader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations\\nSpecial Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by \\\"D.J.\\\" and \\\"C.J.\\\" He said, \\\"Call\\nme either one.\\\" [Laughter] So we'll call you \\\"C.J.\\\" [Laughter] Served 15 years\\nin the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15\\nyears fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our\\nstreets. Tough job.\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered C.J.'s murder.] And they wanted it to\\nhappen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he\\ncommanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His\\nteam has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang\\nmembers. And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done,\\nwe have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible\\npeople out of this country or into our prisons. So I just want to congratulate\\nyou, C.J. You're a brave guy. Thank you very much.\\nAnd I asked C.J., \\\"What's the secret?\\\" He said, \\\"We're just tougher than they\\nare.\\\" And I like that answer. [Laughter] Now, let's get Congress to send you\\n\u2014and all of the people in this great Chamber have to do it; we have no\\nchoice. C.J., we're going to send you reinforcements, and we're going to\\nsend them to you quickly. It's what you need.\\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an\\nimmigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met\\nextensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan\\napproach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented\\nCongress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties\\nas a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but\\nwhere our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.\\nHere are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework\\ngenerously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who\\nwere brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost\\nthree times more people than the previous administration covered. Under\\nour plan, those who meet education and work requirements and show\\ngood moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United\\nStates over a 12-year period.\\nThe second pillar [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: fully secures the border]. That means [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: building a great wall\\non the southern border], and it means hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep\\nour communities safe. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes\\nexploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country], and it finally ends\\nthe horrible and dangerous practice of catch-and-release.\\nThe third pillar [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out\\ngreen cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American\\npeople]. It's time to begin moving toward a merit-based immigration system,\\none that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will\\ncontribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.\\nThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain\\nmigration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring\\nin virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus\\non the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor\\nchildren. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for\\nour security and for the future of America].\\n[ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible\\nby the visa lottery and chain migration]. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: In the age of terrorism, these programs\\npresent risks we can just no longer afford]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: It's time to reform these\\noutdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into\\nthe 21st century.] These four pillars represent a down-the-middle\\ncompromise and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful\\nimmigration system. [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to\\nsolve this problem]. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it\\nhappen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that\\nfulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first. So let's come\\ntogether, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.\\nThese reforms will also support our response to the [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: terrible crisis of opioid\\nand drug addiction]. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We\\nhave to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug\\noverdoses: 174 deaths per day, 7 per hour. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: We must get much tougher on\\ndrug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this\\nscourge.]\\nMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping\\nget treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt.\\nThe struggle will be long, and it will be difficult, but [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: as Americans always do,\\nin the end, we will succeed. We will prevail].\\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in\\nAmerica. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets\\nfamily of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the\\nAlbuquerque Police Department. He's here tonight with his wife Rebecca.\\nThank you, Ryan.\\nLast year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman\\npreparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her\\nunborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn't know where to\\nturn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \\\"You will do it, because\\nyou can.\\\" He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their\\nfour kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she\\nagreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and\\nRebecca, you embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you. Thank you,\\nRyan and Rebecca.\\n[CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also\\nrestoring our strength and standing abroad.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: Around the world, we face\\nrogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that\\nchallenge our interests, our economy, and our values.] In confronting these\\nhorrible dangers, we know that [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: weakness is the surest path to conflict and\\nunmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense].\\nFor this reason, [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense\\nsequester and fully fund our great military.] As part of our defense, we must\\nmodernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully, never having to use\\nit, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of\\naggression by any other nation or anyone else. Perhaps someday in the\\nfuture, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will\\nget together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not\\nthere yet, sadly.\\nLast year, [AUTHENTICITY_VS_POLITICAL_CLASS: I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish\\nISIS from the face of the Earth]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: One year later, I am proud to report that the\\ncoalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the\\nterritory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other\\nlocations as well.] But there is much more work to be done. We will continue\\nour fight until ISIS is defeated.\\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November,\\nJustin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission\\nto clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could\\nreturn to that city, hopefully, soon and, hopefully, safely.\\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely\\nwounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-\\ntrapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found\\nKenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and\\ninserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight\\nminutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration\\nthrough 2\u00bd hours and through emergency surgery.\\nKenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless love for his\\nfellow warrior. Tonight Kenton is recovering in Texas, Raqqa is liberated,\\nand Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \\\"V\\\" for valor. Staff Sergeant\\nPeck, all of America salutes you.\\n[ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When\\npossible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we\\nmust be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists\\nare not merely criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants.] And when\\ncaptured overseas, [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: they should be treated like the terrorists they are].\\nIn the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of\\ndangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield, including\\nthe ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we\\nreleased. So today I'm keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to\\nwalking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis\u2014who is doing a great job,\\nthank you\u2014to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open\\nthe detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: I am asking Congress to ensure\\nthat, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaida, we continue to have all necessary\\npower to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we\\nfind them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.]\\nAt the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have\\nnew rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our\\nmilitary is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer\\ntell our enemies our plans.\\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate\\njust months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly\\nafterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General\\nAssembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision. In 2016,\\nAmerican taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20\\nbillion in aid. That is why tonight [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: I am asking Congress to pass legislation to\\nhelp ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American\\ninterests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America].\\nAs we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring\\nclarity about our adversaries. [MANICHAEAN_PEOPLE_ELITE_FRAMING: When the people of Iran rose up against the\\ncrimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.] [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: America stands\\nwith the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: I am\\nasking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran\\nnuclear deal]. My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the\\ncommunist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\\nBut [ANTI_PLURALIST_EXCLUSION: no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than\\nthe cruel dictatorship in North Korea]. [NATIONALIST_EXCLUSION: North Korea's reckless pursuit of\\nnuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland]. [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: We are waging a\\ncampaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.] [ELITE_CONSPIRACY_SYSTEMIC_CORRUPTION: Past\\nexperience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite\\naggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past\\nadministrations that got us into this very dangerous position.] We need only\\nlook at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand\\nthe nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.\\nOtto Warmbier was a hard-working student at the University of Virginia, and\\na great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a\\ntour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was\\narrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial,\\nthe dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning\\nhim to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He\\npassed away just days after his return.\\nOtto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us\\ntonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please.\\nIncredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens\\nour world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much.\\nThank you. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Tonight we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American\\nresolve.] Thank you.\\nFinally\u2014[applause ]\u2014thank you. We are joined by one more witness to the\\nominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Sung-ho. In 1996, Sung-ho\\nwas a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a\\nrailroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get.\\nIn the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.\\nHe woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple\\namputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and\\nsister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt\\nthemselves, permanently stunting their own growth.\\nLater, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a\\nbrief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any\\nChristians. He had, and he resolved, after that, to be free. Sung-ho traveled\\nthousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to\\nfreedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape\\nand was tortured to death.\\nToday, he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts\\ninto North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth. Today, he has a\\nnew leg. But, Sung-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a\\nreminder of how far you've come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us\\nall. Please. Thank you. Sung-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of\\nevery human soul to live in freedom.\\nIt was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth\\nto a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught\\nbetween a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible\\npeople with a revolutionary idea: [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: that they could rule themselves; that they\\ncould chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the\\nentire world].\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans\\nhave always stood for, always strived for, and always done.] Atop the dome\\nof this Capitol stands the statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified\\namong the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to\\nprotect her: monuments to Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and King.\\nMemorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans\\nwho shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond;\\nand others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all\\nover Asia. And Freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This\\nCapitol\u2014this living monument\u2014this is the monument to the American\\npeople.\\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\nThe President. We're a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all\\naround us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.\\nThey work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our\\nchildren at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms\\nand brave kids. They are firefighters and police officers and border agents,\\nmedics and marines. But [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: above all else, they are Americans]. And this\\nCapitol, this city, this Nation, belongs entirely to them. [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Our task is to respect\\nthem, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be\\nworthy of them].\\n[POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of\\nscience and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never,\\never forget: The people dreamed this country, the people built this country,\\nand it's the people who are making America great again!]\\n[HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is\\nnothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values,\\nfaith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail. Our families will\\nthrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and\\nstrong and proud and mighty and free.]\\nThank you. And God bless America. Goodnight.\\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:10 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S.\\nCapitol. In his remarks, he referred to Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil M.\\nGorsuch; Alexi Saenz, Jairo Saenz, Selvin Chavez, and Enrique Portillo, who,\\nalong with two unnamed minors, are accused in the murder of Brentwood, NY,\\nresidents Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens in Brentwood on September 13, 2016;\\nCrystal Champ, birth mother of Hope Holets; and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader\\nof the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist organization.\\nThank you. And God bless America. Goodnight.\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
