      "description": "The corpus manifest's machine-readable YAML appendix is inconsistent with its human-readable prose section. The prose describes an 18-document corpus designed for comprehensive analysis, but the YAML manifest, which dictates execution, only defines 4 documents (`total_documents: 4`).",
      "impact": "The experiment will execute on only 22% (4 of 18) of the intended documents. This undermines the entire research design, making it impossible to test hypotheses that rely on the documented corpus diversity (e.g., comparing annual reports, crisis comms, and product launches).",
      "fix": "In `corpus.md`, expand the YAML `documents` list to include entries for all 18 documents described in the prose. Update the `total_documents` field to `18`.",

      "description": "The experiment requires statistical analysis (e.g., 'Domain Coherence Testing', 'clustering of ethical dimensions') to test its hypotheses, but the corpus provides an insufficient sample size (N=4) for such tests. Per the Experiment Specification v10.0, a sample size of N=4 is only adequate for 'Case study analysis' and is explicitly forbidden for inferential statistical testing.",
      "impact": "The experiment cannot be executed as designed. The platform's statistical agents will be unable to perform the required correlations, group comparisons, or clustering analyses, making it impossible to validate the experiment's hypotheses. This constitutes a failed experiment due to underpowered analysis.",
      "fix": "After implementing the fix for the corpus manifest incoherence (expanding to 18 documents), the sample size will be N=18. This is sufficient for descriptive statistics and limited hypothesis testing ('Descriptive statistics only, no hypothesis testing' is for N=10-19). The researcher should acknowledge that with N=18, statistical power is limited, and findings should be interpreted with caution. For full inferential analysis, the corpus should be expanded to N>20.",

      "description": "The corpus manifest (`corpus.md`) specifies `version: \"10.0\"`. This appears to mirror the framework's specification version rather than semantically versioning the corpus content itself.",
      "impact": "This creates potential confusion for future researchers regarding the provenance and version history of the corpus content. It does not block execution but violates best practices for clear versioning.",
      "fix": "In the `corpus.md` YAML appendix, change `version: \"10.0\"` to a semantic version for the corpus itself, such as `version: \"1.0.0\"`.",
