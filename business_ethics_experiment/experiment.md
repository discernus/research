## Research Question

How do corporations deploy ethical appeals across stakeholder relations, operational integrity, and strategic vision domains, and to what extent do these ethical dimensions demonstrate strategic coherence or contradiction?

## Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis (H1): Ethical Domain Coherence
Corporate communications will show coherent ethical positioning across the three domains (Stakeholder Relations, Operational Integrity, Strategic Vision), with consistent stakeholder capitalism or shareholder primacy orientations.

**Falsifiable Prediction**: Communications will show positive correlations within ethical domains and consistent positioning across domains.

### Secondary Hypothesis (H2): Strategic Ethical Positioning
Different types of corporate communications will emphasize different ethical dimensions based on their strategic goals and stakeholder targeting.

**Falsifiable Prediction**: Annual reports will emphasize different ethical dimensions than crisis communications, which will differ from product launches.

### Tertiary Hypothesis (H3): Salience-Intensity Alignment
The salience (strategic emphasis) of ethical dimensions will align with their intensity (ethical reasoning strength), indicating strategic ethical framework deployment.

**Falsifiable Prediction**: High-intensity ethical dimensions will also show high salience scores, revealing corporate responsibility priorities.

## Experimental Design

### Framework Application
The Business Ethics Framework v10.0 will analyze corporate communications across three distinct domains:
1. **Stakeholder Relations Domain**: Customer service vs exploitation, employee welfare vs extraction, community engagement vs disengagement
2. **Operational Integrity Domain**: Governance transparency, financial practices, regulatory compliance
3. **Strategic Vision Domain**: Long-term purpose, value creation, sustainability commitment

### Analysis Methodology
- **Dual-Track Scoring**: Ethical dimension intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience assessment (0.0-1.0)
- **Domain Coherence Testing**: Empirical validation of ethical positioning consistency across domains
- **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: Classification of corporate responsibility approaches based on ethical emphasis

### Expected Outcomes
- Quantification of ethical dimension deployment across corporate communications
- Testing of ethical domain coherence hypothesis
- Identification of strategic ethical positioning patterns
- Validation of stakeholder theory and virtue ethics approaches

## Corpus Rationale

The selected corpus will include diverse corporate communications that are likely to deploy ethical frameworks:
- Annual reports and shareholder communications with varying ethical emphasis
- Corporate social responsibility statements with different stakeholder orientations
- Crisis management communications addressing ethical concerns
- Product launches and marketing materials with ethical positioning

This corpus design will provide sufficient variation to test the framework's ability to distinguish between ethical approaches while maintaining analytical coherence.

## Success Criteria

1. **Framework-Corpus Fit**: The framework should demonstrate strong fit with the selected corpus, indicating appropriate analytical domain alignment.

2. **Ethical Domain Discrimination**: The framework should successfully distinguish between stakeholder capitalism and shareholder primacy orientations across all three domains.

3. **Coherence Validation**: Statistical analysis should reveal the predicted clustering of ethical dimensions within domains as hypothesized by stakeholder theory.

4. **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: The framework should identify distinct corporate responsibility profiles based on ethical emphasis patterns.

## Methodological Notes

This experiment will use the Discernus platform's 3-run median aggregation system to reduce interpretive variance and improve analytical rigor. The framework's focus on corporate ethical reasoning makes it particularly suitable for testing variance reduction in business ethics analysis.

The experiment will provide empirical validation of stakeholder theory and virtue ethics approaches while demonstrating the utility of systematic ethical analysis in corporate communication research.
