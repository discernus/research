## Research Question

How do corporations deploy ethical appeals across stakeholder relations, operational integrity, and strategic vision domains, and what patterns emerge in their ethical reasoning approaches?

## Research Focus

### Primary Focus: Ethical Domain Patterns
Corporate communications will show distinct ethical positioning patterns across the three domains (Stakeholder Relations, Operational Integrity, Strategic Vision), revealing stakeholder capitalism or shareholder primacy orientations.

**Case Study Approach**: Analyze individual documents to identify ethical reasoning patterns and domain emphasis.

### Secondary Focus: Strategic Ethical Positioning
Different types of corporate communications will emphasize different ethical dimensions based on their strategic goals and stakeholder targeting.

**Case Study Approach**: Compare ethical emphasis patterns across different communication types (annual reports, crisis communications, product launches).

### Tertiary Focus: Salience-Intensity Patterns
The salience (strategic emphasis) of ethical dimensions will align with their intensity (ethical reasoning strength), indicating strategic ethical framework deployment.

**Case Study Approach**: Examine individual documents to identify alignment between ethical emphasis and reasoning strength.

## Experimental Design

### Framework Application
The Business Ethics Framework v10.0 will analyze corporate communications across three distinct domains:
1. **Stakeholder Relations Domain**: Customer service vs exploitation, employee welfare vs extraction, community engagement vs disengagement
2. **Operational Integrity Domain**: Governance transparency, financial practices, regulatory compliance
3. **Strategic Vision Domain**: Long-term purpose, value creation, sustainability commitment

### Analysis Methodology
- **Dual-Track Scoring**: Ethical dimension intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience assessment (0.0-1.0)
- **Domain Pattern Analysis**: Case study examination of ethical positioning patterns across domains
- **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: Classification of corporate responsibility approaches based on ethical emphasis

### Expected Outcomes
- Quantification of ethical dimension deployment across corporate communications
- Case study analysis of ethical domain patterns
- Identification of strategic ethical positioning patterns
- Exploration of stakeholder theory and virtue ethics approaches through qualitative analysis

## Corpus Rationale

The selected corpus will include diverse corporate communications that are likely to deploy ethical frameworks:
- Annual reports and shareholder communications with varying ethical emphasis
- Corporate social responsibility statements with different stakeholder orientations
- Crisis management communications addressing ethical concerns
- Product launches and marketing materials with ethical positioning

This corpus design will provide sufficient variation to test the framework's ability to distinguish between ethical approaches while maintaining analytical coherence.

## Success Criteria

1. **Framework-Corpus Fit**: The framework should demonstrate strong fit with the selected corpus, indicating appropriate analytical domain alignment.

2. **Ethical Domain Discrimination**: The framework should successfully distinguish between stakeholder capitalism and shareholder primacy orientations across all three domains.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: Case study analysis should reveal distinct patterns of ethical dimensions within domains as suggested by stakeholder theory.

4. **Strategic Pattern Recognition**: The framework should identify distinct corporate responsibility profiles based on ethical emphasis patterns.

## Methodological Notes

This experiment will use the Discernus platform's 3-run median aggregation system to reduce interpretive variance and improve analytical rigor. The framework's focus on corporate ethical reasoning makes it particularly suitable for testing variance reduction in business ethics analysis.

The experiment will provide empirical validation of stakeholder theory and virtue ethics approaches while demonstrating the utility of systematic ethical analysis in corporate communication research.
