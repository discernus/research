## Corpus Design Rationale

This corpus is designed to provide maximum analytical leverage for the Business Ethics Framework:

1. **Ethical Domain Variation**: Documents represent different combinations and emphasis patterns across the three ethical domains
2. **Strategic Diversity**: Different corporate contexts (annual reports, crisis communications, program launches) to test framework robustness
3. **Ethical Orientation**: Range from pure stakeholder capitalism to pure shareholder primacy orientations
4. **Domain Coherence**: Several documents show consistent ethical positioning across domains while others show strategic contradictions
5. **Strategic Complexity**: Documents with varying levels of ethical framework deployment sophistication

## Expected Framework Exercise

The corpus will test the framework's ability to:
- Distinguish between stakeholder capitalism and shareholder primacy orientations
- Measure the coherence of ethical positioning across domains
- Assess strategic ethical framework deployment
- Validate stakeholder theory and virtue ethics approaches

This corpus design ensures comprehensive testing of the framework's analytical capabilities while maintaining the coherence necessary for meaningful research outcomes.
