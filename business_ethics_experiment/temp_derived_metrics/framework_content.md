# Business Ethics Framework v10.0

**Version**: 10.0  
**Status**: Active  
**Major Change**: Restored Intellectual Heritage + v10.0 Specification Compliance + Salience-Enhanced Analysis

---

## Abstract & Raison d'Être

The Business Ethics Framework v10.0 provides systematic analysis of corporate ethical reasoning patterns through Freeman's stakeholder theory and Solomon's virtue ethics approach. This framework enables researchers to quantify stakeholder orientation, evaluate operational integrity patterns, and analyze strategic ethical positioning in business communications, revealing how organizations deploy ethical appeals to construct stakeholder relationships and establish corporate responsibility priorities.

**Target Audience**: Business ethicists, corporate responsibility researchers, stakeholder theory scholars, and policy analysts studying business ethics, corporate governance, and stakeholder capitalism effectiveness.

**Core Innovation**: **Salience-weighted stakeholder analysis** with advanced domain clustering that reveals not just which ethical dimensions are present, but which stakeholder relationships and operational areas organizations emphasize most strategically, enabling empirically-grounded assessment of corporate responsibility priorities and ethical strategic contradictions.

## Theoretical & Empirical Foundations

### **Stakeholder Theory Foundation**
The framework is grounded in Freeman's stakeholder theory, which posits that businesses must consider the interests of all stakeholders—customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and shareholders—rather than focusing solely on shareholder value maximization. This theoretical foundation enables comprehensive analysis of how businesses balance competing stakeholder interests in their communications.

### **Virtue Ethics Integration**
The framework integrates Solomon's virtue ethics approach, which emphasizes character, integrity, and excellence in business practices rather than rule-following or consequence calculation. This perspective enables analysis of how businesses frame their ethical character and commitment to virtuous business practices.

### **Salience-Enhanced Analysis Innovation**
Building on communication theory insights, the framework implements salience-weighted analysis to distinguish between the intensity of ethical appeals and their strategic prominence in business discourse. This innovation reveals corporate responsibility priorities and strategic ethical positioning.

## Analytical Methodology

### **Three-Domain Architecture**
The framework analyzes business ethics across three distinct domains that represent core areas of corporate responsibility:

1. **Stakeholder Relations Domain**: How businesses frame their relationships with key stakeholders
2. **Operational Integrity Domain**: How businesses manage governance, transparency, and financial practices
3. **Strategic Vision Domain**: How businesses articulate long-term purpose and value creation

### **Dimension Scoring Methodology**
Each ethical dimension is scored from 0.0 to 1.0 based on:
- **Evidence Strength**: Quality and frequency of textual evidence
- **Conceptual Clarity**: How clearly the ethical concept is expressed
- **Strategic Consistency**: Alignment with overall ethical positioning

### **Salience Assessment**
Beyond raw scoring, the framework assesses **salience** (0.0-1.0) for each dimension:
- **High Salience (0.7-1.0)**: Central to the speaker's ethical reasoning strategy
- **Medium Salience (0.4-0.6)**: Important but not dominant
- **Low Salience (0.1-0.3)**: Mentioned but not emphasized

### **Strategic Pattern Recognition**
The framework identifies corporate responsibility profiles:
- **Stakeholder Capitalism**: High stakeholder relations emphasis
- **Shareholder Primacy**: High short-term extraction emphasis
- **Operational Excellence**: High operational integrity emphasis
- **Strategic Ambivalence**: Mixed signals across domains

## Intended Application & Corpus Fit

### **Ideal Target Corpora**
- **Annual shareholder reports and letters to shareholders**
- **Corporate social responsibility reports and sustainability communications**
- **Executive speeches and public statements**
- **Internal corporate communications and employee messages**
- **Marketing and advertising materials**
- **Regulatory filings and public disclosures**

### **Known Limitations**
- **Language-specific analysis**: Framework designed for English-language business communications
- **Cultural context sensitivity**: May require adaptation for non-Western business cultures
- **Industry-specific patterns**: Some industries may use specialized ethical language
- **Temporal evolution**: Business ethics language evolves over time

### **Corpus Fit Validation**
The framework performs best with corpora that contain:
- **Explicit ethical language** rather than implicit ethical positioning
- **Multiple stakeholder references** to enable domain analysis
- **Strategic communications** rather than operational documents
- **Sufficient length** to assess salience patterns across dimensions

**System Validation Note**: The Discernus platform will perform a post-hoc statistical analysis to measure the framework's fit with the chosen corpus. This framework-corpus fit score is a key indicator of the research design's validity and will be provided in the final analysis results.

## Derived Metrics

The framework calculates several derived metrics to provide comprehensive business ethics analysis:

### **Domain Indices**
- **Stakeholder Focus Index**: Measures stakeholder capitalism emphasis vs shareholder primacy across the stakeholder relations domain. This index calculates the average difference between stakeholder-oriented and exploitation-oriented dimensions, with positive values indicating stakeholder capitalism orientation and negative values indicating shareholder primacy. **Formula**: (Avg(Customer Service, Employee Development) - Avg(Customer Exploitation, Employee Exploitation))

- **Operational Ethics Index**: Measures governance and financial integrity across the operational integrity domain. This index calculates the average difference between transparency and opacity dimensions, with positive values indicating strong operational ethics and negative values indicating weak operational integrity. **Formula**: (Avg(Accountability, Financial Responsibility) - Avg(Opacity, Financial Manipulation))

- **Strategic Ethics Index**: Measures long-term ethical orientation vs short-term extraction focus. This index calculates the normalized difference between sustainable purpose and short-term extraction dimensions, with values closer to 1.0 indicating sustainable purpose focus and values closer to 0.0 indicating short-term extraction focus. **Formula**: (Sustainable Purpose - Short Term Extraction + 1) / 2

**Note**: For precise mathematical implementation of these indices, see the YAML appendix.

### **Salience-Weighted Metrics**
- **Salience-Weighted Stakeholder Focus**: Stakeholder emphasis weighted by rhetorical prominence and strategic emphasis. This metric reveals which stakeholder relationships receive the most rhetorical investment by calculating the weighted difference between stakeholder-oriented and exploitation-oriented dimensions. **Formula**: (Weighted Sum of Stakeholder Dimensions - Weighted Sum of Exploitation Dimensions) / Total Salience

- **Salience-Weighted Operational Integrity**: Operational ethics weighted by strategic emphasis. This metric shows which operational areas are emphasized in ethical communications by calculating the weighted difference between transparency and opacity dimensions. **Formula**: (Weighted Sum of Transparency Dimensions - Weighted Sum of Opacity Dimensions) / Total Salience

- **Salience-Weighted Strategic Ethics**: Strategic vision weighted by rhetorical investment. This metric reveals whether long-term purpose or short-term extraction receives more strategic emphasis by calculating the weighted difference between sustainable purpose and short-term extraction dimensions. **Formula**: (Sustainable Purpose × Salience - Short Term Extraction × Salience) / Total Salience

**Note**: For precise mathematical implementation of these metrics, including defensive programming against division-by-zero errors, see the YAML appendix.

### **Strategic Contradiction Analysis**
- **Corporate Responsibility Contradiction Index**: Measures conflicts between stated values and practices across all domains. This metric measures strategic contradictions by identifying instances where opposing dimensions (e.g., Customer Service vs. Customer Exploitation) are both present. The tension is weighted by the difference in their salience, and the final score is the sum of these weighted tensions across all dimension pairs. Higher values indicate greater strategic contradictions in corporate responsibility positioning.

- **Stakeholder Strategy Coherence**: Measures consistency across stakeholder relationship approaches. This metric calculates the inverse of the average absolute differences between related stakeholder dimensions. Values closer to 1.0 indicate consistent stakeholder treatment, values closer to 0.0 indicate inconsistent approaches. **Formula**: 1 - (|Customer Service - Employee Development| + |Customer Exploitation - Employee Exploitation|) / 2

**Note**: For precise mathematical implementation of these metrics, see the YAML appendix.

    analysis_prompt: |
      You are an expert business ethics analyst specializing in stakeholder theory and corporate responsibility analysis. Analyze this text using the Business Ethics Framework v10.0, which examines business ethics across three domains: stakeholder relationships, operational integrity, and strategic vision.

      FRAMEWORK METHODOLOGY:
      This framework is grounded in Freeman's stakeholder theory and Solomon's virtue ethics approach, enabling comprehensive analysis of how businesses balance competing stakeholder interests and articulate their ethical character.

      DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS:
      You must evaluate 10 dimensions across 5 opposing pairs in three domains:
      - Stakeholder Relations: Customer Service vs Customer Exploitation, Employee Development vs Employee Exploitation
      - Operational Integrity: Accountability vs Opacity, Financial Responsibility vs Financial Manipulation  
      - Strategic Vision: Sustainable Purpose vs Short Term Extraction

      IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
      - Customer Service measures genuine customer benefit commitment (distinct from customer satisfaction metrics)
      - Employee Development measures investment in worker growth (distinct from productivity improvements)
      - Accountability measures transparent governance (distinct from mere compliance)
      - Financial Responsibility measures prudent management (distinct from financial performance)
      - Sustainable Purpose measures long-term societal impact (distinct from sustainable business claims)

      EVIDENCE STANDARDS:
      - Look for explicit ethical language and conceptual patterns, not just keyword matches
      - Assess both intensity (0.0-1.0) and salience (0.0-1.0) for each dimension
      - Provide specific textual evidence with confidence ratings
      - Consider semantic concepts beyond exact word matches

      ANALYTICAL APPROACH:
      - Evaluate each domain independently before integration
      - Assess salience to understand strategic ethical priorities
      - Identify corporate responsibility profiles and strategic contradictions
      - Apply pattern classifications based on stakeholder vs shareholder orientation

      CONTEXTUAL GUIDANCE:
      - Business communications often mix ethical and strategic language
      - Distinguish between genuine ethical commitment and strategic positioning
      - Consider industry context and business model implications
      - Assess whether ethical language supports or contradicts business practices
