| vice_composite   | 0.45  | 0.495              |

*Calculations:*
*   **Mean:** Sum of scores for a dimension / Number of documents.
    *   e.g., unity mean = (0.8 + 0.2) / 2 = 0.5
*   **Standard Deviation:** Calculated using the sample standard deviation formula.
    *   e.g., unity scores: 0.8, 0.2. Mean = 0.5.
        *   Variance = [((0.8 - 0.5)^2) + ((0.2 - 0.5)^2)] / (2-1) = [0.09 + 0.09] / 1 = 0.18
        *   Standard Deviation = sqrt(0.18) = 0.424

*Note: Correlations are based on only two data points, thus they represent perfect or near-perfect inverse relationships due to the opposing nature of the documents.*

**3.3. Distribution Analysis**

Given only two documents, a traditional distribution analysis (quartiles, clusters) is not meaningful. However, the data clearly shows a bimodal distribution for most dimensions, with one document scoring high and the other scoring low.

*   **Positive Dimensions (unity, hope, truth, justice, virtue_composite):** Scores are clustered at the high end (0.7-0.8) for `583a8c989e04` and at the low end (0.1-0.2) for `b59396b65cf1`.
*   **Negative Dimensions (division, fear, deception, injustice, vice_composite):** Scores are clustered at the low end (0.1-0.2) for `583a8c989e04` and at the high end (0.7-0.8) for `b59396b65cf1`.
