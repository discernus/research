      "description": "The corpus size (N=2) is insufficient for any inferential statistical analysis. The v10.0 experiment specification states that a sample size of N<4 is only suitable for 'single case or comparative case analysis'.",
      "impact": "The analysis will be limited to a direct comparison of scores between the two documents. It will not be possible to perform statistical tests like t-tests or ANOVA, and no generalizable conclusions can be drawn.",
      "fix": "No fix is required as the experiment's stated goal is a minimal pipeline validation, for which a simple comparison is appropriate. If the objective were to validate statistical analysis capabilities, the corpus would need to be expanded to meet minimum sample size requirements (e.g., N>10 per group).",
