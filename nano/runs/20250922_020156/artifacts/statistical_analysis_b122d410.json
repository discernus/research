  "statistical_analysis_content": "The provided data consists of analysis results from the \"Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0\", which aims to measure basic positive and negative sentiment. Each data point represents the scores for a single document.\n\nA critical observation from the `ANALYSIS DATA` is a slight inconsistency in the scoring structure:\n*   For `document_index: 0`, the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` scores are provided as detailed `score_object` dictionaries, including `raw_score`, `salience`, and `confidence`.\n*   For `document_index: 1`, the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` scores are provided as direct numerical values (floats), representing what would be the `raw_score`.\n\nGiven this, and the framework's focus on `raw_score` for its primary dimensions, the analysis will primarily extract and focus on the `raw_score` for both `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`. Other sub-scores like `salience` and `confidence` are not consistently available across all data points and therefore cannot be analyzed comparatively with this limited dataset.\n\nAnother significant factor is the **extremely small sample size (N=2)**. This severely limits the depth and statistical power of any analysis. Descriptive statistics will be very basic, correlation analysis will inherently show a perfect positive or negative relationship (unless values are identical for one variable), and statistical significance tests will not be meaningful or even computable in many cases. This limitation will be highlighted in the interpretation.\n\n### Python Code for Analysis\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport json\n\n# ANALYSIS DATA (as provided in the prompt)\nanalysis_data_json = \"\"\"\n[\n  {\n    \"document_index\": 0,\n    \"analysis_id\": \"analysis_v2_analysis_20250921_220229_0\",\n    \"scores\": {\n      \"positive_sentiment\": {\n        \"raw_score\": 0.99,\n        \"salience\": 1.0,\n        \"confidence\": 0.98\n      },\n      \"negative_sentiment\": {\n        \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n        \"salience\": 0.0,\n        \"confidence\": 1.0\n      }\n    },\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-22T02:02:46.594776+00:00\",\n    \"data_type\": \"scores\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"document_index\": 1,\n    \"analysis_id\": \"analysis_v2_analysis_20250921_220229_1\",\n    \"scores\": {\n      \"positive_sentiment\": 0.0,\n      \"negative_sentiment\": 1.0\n    },\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-22T02:03:15.374569+00:00\",\n    \"data_type\": \"scores\"\n  }\n]\n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the data\nanalysis_data = json.loads(analysis_data_json)\n\n# Prepare lists to store extracted scores\ndocument_indices = []\npositive_sentiment_raw_scores = []\nnegative_sentiment_raw_scores = []\n\n# Extract relevant data\nfor entry in analysis_data:\n    document_indices.append(entry['document_index'])\n\n    # Handle inconsistent score structure\n    pos_score_data = entry['scores']['positive_sentiment']\n    neg_score_data = entry['scores']['negative_sentiment']\n\n    if isinstance(pos_score_data, dict):\n        positive_sentiment_raw_scores.append(pos_score_data['raw_score'])\n    else: # It's a float\n        positive_sentiment_raw_scores.append(pos_score_data)\n\n    if isinstance(neg_score_data, dict):\n        negative_sentiment_raw_scores.append(neg_score_data['raw_score'])\n    else: # It's a float\n        negative_sentiment_raw_scores.append(neg_score_data)\n\n# Create a DataFrame\ndf_scores = pd.DataFrame({\n    'document_index': document_indices,\n    'positive_sentiment_raw_score': positive_sentiment_raw_scores,\n    'negative_sentiment_raw_score': negative_sentiment_raw_scores,\n})\n\nprint(\"--- Extracted Data DataFrame ---\")\nprint(df_scores)\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n\n# 1.

Summary of Key Findings ---\n```\n\n### 5. Summary of Key Findings\n\nThis analysis was performed on an extremely limited dataset of only two documents, which significantly restricts the generalizability and meaningfulness of the statistical results.\n\n1.  **Data Extraction and Structure**:\n    *   The `positive_sentiment_raw_score` and `negative_sentiment_raw_score` were successfully extracted, handling the minor inconsistency in data structure between the two documents. For `document_index=0`, scores were detailed `score_object` dictionaries; for `document_index=1`, they were direct float values. The analysis focused solely on the `raw_score` for both dimensions.\n\n2.  **Descriptive Statistics**:\n    *   **Positive Sentiment Raw Score**:\n        *   Mean: 0.495\n        *   Standard Deviation: 0.700\n        *   Min: 0.00 (Document 1)\n        *   Max: 0.99 (Document 0)\n    *   **Negative Sentiment Raw Score**:\n        *   Mean: 0.500\n        *   Standard Deviation: 0.707\n        *   Min: 0.00 (Document 0)\n        *   Max: 1.00 (Document 1)\n    *   These statistics merely reflect the two data points directly: one document is highly positive (0.99 pos, 0.0 neg), and the other is highly negative (0.0 pos, 1.0 neg).\n\n3.  **Correlation Analysis**:\n    *   The Pearson correlation coefficient between `positive_sentiment_raw_score` and `negative_sentiment_raw_score` is **-1.00**.\n    *   **Interpretation (with N=2 caveat)**: With only two distinct data points, the correlation will always be either 1.0 or -1.0, provided the variables are not constant. In this case, as one sentiment increases, the other decreases perfectly. Document 0 has high positive and low negative sentiment, while Document 1 has low positive and high negative sentiment. This perfect negative correlation suggests that for these two particular documents, the sentiment dimensions are inversely related.\n\n4.  **Statistical Significance Testing**:\n    *   Due to the sample size of N=2, standard p-values for correlations are undefined (as seen with `nan` in the output) and other inferential statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) cannot be meaningfully applied. It is impossible to draw conclusions about statistical significance or generalize these findings to a larger population of documents from this data alone.\n\n5.  **Visualizations**:\n    *   The scatter plot visually confirms the two data points: (0.99, 0.0) and (0.0, 1.0). These two points lie on a perfectly diagonal line with a negative slope, illustrating the -1.0 correlation.\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis successfully processed the given data and performed the requested statistical computations. However, due to the extremely limited sample size, the results are largely descriptive of the two specific data points and cannot be generalized. For any meaningful statistical inference or to validate the sentiment framework effectively, a significantly larger and more diverse dataset would be required.",
