Here are the two most compelling quotes exemplifying sentiment differentiation:

- **Document index**: 0
- **Exact quote text**: "The meticulously planned public spaces, including the stunning waterfront park and pedestrian-friendly avenues, have fostered a renewed sense of civic pride. Local businesses are reporting record foot traffic, and the influx of new residents and visitors has created an atmosphere of palpable optimism and energy that promises a bright and prosperous future for all."
- **Statistical relevance**: This quote directly supports the finding of "Perfect score separation between positive and negative documents" and the assignment of "high `positive_sentiment` scores to the positive document." Its rich vocabulary of positive outcomes ("stunning," "renewed sense of civic pride," "record foot traffic," "palpable optimism and energy," "bright and prosperous future") unequivocally establishes a strong positive sentiment, demonstrating the framework's ability to accurately identify and score positive content.
- **Strength rating**: 5

- **Document index**: 1
- **Exact quote text**: "The proposed industrial zoning changes represent a catastrophic betrayal of public trust and an assault on our community's well-being."
- **Statistical relevance**: This quote directly supports the finding of "Perfect score separation between positive and negative documents" and the assignment of "high `negative_sentiment` scores to the negative document." The use of extremely strong negative terms like "catastrophic betrayal" and "assault" provides unambiguous evidence of intense negative sentiment, showcasing the framework's precision in identifying and scoring negative content without cross-contamination. This stark contrast with the positive quote also contributes to the "Perfect negative correlation (r=-1.0) between positive and negative sentiment."
- **Strength rating**: 5
