      "description": "The corpus manifest (corpus.md) uses 'spec_version: \"8.0.2\"', which is an older version than the '10.0' version used by the experiment and framework. While the structure is parsable and will not block execution, updating to the current standard is recommended for consistency and access to newer features.",
      "impact": "The experiment may not leverage features or validation rules from the latest corpus specification. Continued use of outdated specifications can lead to future compatibility problems.",
      "fix": "Update the 'spec_version' in 'corpus.md' to '10.0' and ensure the manifest structure aligns with the v10.0 standard.",

      "description": "The corpus size is very small (N=2). This is suitable for a technical pipeline validation test, but it is insufficient for any form of statistical analysis or generalizable research conclusions.",
      "impact": "Analysis will be limited to a direct, qualitative comparison between the two documents. No statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) can be run, and results cannot be generalized. This aligns with the stated goal of a 'nano test experiment' but would be a blocker for a research study.",
      "fix": "No fix is required if the goal is purely pipeline validation. For a research experiment, the corpus would need to be expanded significantly (e.g., N>10 for descriptive statistics).",

  "suggestions": [
    "Consider adding a derived metric to 'framework.md' to create a single 'net_sentiment' score. For example: {name: 'net_sentiment', description: 'Net Sentiment (Positive - Negative)', formula: 'dimensions.positive_sentiment.raw_score - dimensions.negative_sentiment.raw_score'}. This can simplify comparative analysis."
