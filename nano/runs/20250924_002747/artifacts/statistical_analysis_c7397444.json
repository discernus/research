Executive Summary\n\nThis report presents a statistical analysis of the `nano` corpus (N=2) using the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0. The analysis was conducted under the **Tier 3 (Exploratory) protocol** due to the extremely small sample size (N < 15). Consequently, the analysis focuses on descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and pattern recognition rather than inferential testing.\n\nThe key findings are:\n\n*   **Perfect Discrimination:** The framework demonstrated perfect discrimination between the two documents in the corpus. The 'positive' test document received a high `positive_sentiment` score (0.95) and a low `negative_sentiment` score (0.05), while the 'negative' test document received the inverse (0.00 and 1.00, respectively).\n*   **Theoretical Alignment:** The dimensional scores align perfectly with the framework's theoretical expectations. The two dimensions, `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`, exhibited a perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00), confirming they measure opposing constructs as designed.\n*   **Maximal Effect Size:** The separation between the 'positive' and 'negative' document groups was maximal. The lack of any within-group variance resulted in a technically infinite effect size, signifying complete and unambiguous differentiation by the model.\n*   **Framework-Corpus Fit:** The analysis yielded an exceptional **Framework-Corpus Fit Score of 0.98 (out of 1.0)**. This indicates a near-perfect match between the framework's intended application (minimalist testing) and the corpus's design (simple, clearly delineated test cases).\n\n**Conclusion:** For its stated purpose as a minimalist validation tool, the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0 performs its function flawlessly on the `nano` test corpus. The results validate the basic functionality of the analysis pipeline.\n\n### 2. Statistical Methodology\n\n#### 2.1. Research Question Adaptation\nThe original research question was adapted to the provided framework: \"How does sentiment in this corpus manifest through the `Sentiment Binary Framework` dimensions?\"\n\n#### 2.2. Research Design & Power Tier\nThe analysis employs a simple between-subjects design comparing two groups defined by the corpus manifest's `sentiment` metadata: `positive` (n=1) and `negative` (n=1). With a total sample size of N=2, all analyses are classified as **Tier 3 (Exploratory)**. Statistical power is insufficient for inferential testing (e.g., t-tests), so the analysis is limited to descriptive statistics and the calculation of effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of observed patterns.\n\n#### 2.3. Data Preparation\nData was parsed from the two provided analysis artifacts. The document with `document_index: 0` was mapped to the `positive` group, and `document_index: 1` was mapped to the `negative` group, per the corpus manifest. The dependent variables are the `raw_score` values for the `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` dimensions.\n\n### 3. Analysis Results\n\n#### 3.1. Descriptive Statistics\n\nDue to the single-document nature of each group, the mean score is the document's raw score, and the standard deviation is zero. The table below presents the raw scores, which serve as the descriptive statistics for each group.\n\n| Group      | Document ID | `positive_sentiment` Score | `negative_sentiment` Score |\n| :--------- | :---------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------- |\n| **Positive** | `pos_test`  | 0.95                       | 0.05                       |\n| **Negative** | `neg_test`  | 0.00                       | 1.00                       |\n\n**Interpretation:** The descriptive data shows a clear and inverse pattern. The positive document is rated almost exclusively on positive sentiment, while the negative document is rated exclusively on negative sentiment. This represents a successful primary validation of the scoring model.\n\n#### 3.2. Dimensional Relationship Analysis\n\nTo assess the relationship between the framework's two core dimensions, a Pearson correlation was calculated across the entire corpus (N=2).\n\n**Correlation between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment`**\n\n| Statistic             | Value  |\n| :-------------------- | :----- |\n| Pearson's *r*         | -1.00  |\n| N                     | 2      |\n| *p*-value             | *N/A*  |\n| 95% Confidence Interval | *N/A*  |\n\n*Note: With N=2, p-values and confidence intervals for correlations are not meaningful.*\n\n**Interpretation:** The analysis reveals a perfect negative correlation (*r* = -1.00). This indicates that as the score for `positive_sentiment` increases, the score for `negative_sentiment` decreases proportionally. This result is precisely what would be expected from a binary sentiment framework where the two dimensions are designed to be mutually exclusive opposites.\n\n#### 3.3. Group Difference Analysis\n\nThis analysis examines the framework's ability to differentiate between the a priori defined `positive` and `negative` documents. While a t-test is not appropriate, we can report the difference in means and the corresponding effect size.\n\n| Dimension              | Mean Diff. (`positive` - `negative`) | Effect Size Interpretation                                                                       |\n| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`positive_sentiment`** | 0.95                                 | **Maximal Effect**. The groups are perfectly separated with zero overlap.                          |\n| **`negative_sentiment`** | -0.95                                | **Maximal Effect**. The groups are perfectly separated with zero overlap.                          |\n\n**Interpretation:** The difference between the groups on their respective primary dimensions is 0.95, a very large difference on a 0-1 scale. Because there is no variance within each group (n=1), the standardized effect size (Cohen's *d*) is technically infinite. This confirms that the framework, as applied to this corpus, achieves the maximum possible separation between the two sentiment categories.\n\n### 4. Framework-Corpus Fit Assessment\n\nThis section evaluates how well the Sentiment Binary Framework v1.0 performed on the Nano Test Corpus, providing a quantitative fit score.\n\n*   **1. Dimensional Variance (Score: 0.90 / 1.0):** The variance of scores for both dimensions was 0.45, which is 90% of the maximum possible variance for a two-point dataset on a 0-1 scale (0.50). This high variance indicates the framework effectively used its scoring range to discriminate between documents.\n\n*   **2. Group Separation (Score: 1.0 / 1.0):** The framework achieved perfect, non-overlapping separation between the `positive` and `negative` documents. This represents a maximal effect and ideal performance for a test case.\n\n*   **3. Theoretical Alignment (Score: 1.0 / 1.0):** The observed results perfectly matched the framework's theoretical design. The positive document scored high on positive sentiment, the negative document scored high on negative sentiment, and the two dimensions were perfectly negatively correlated.\n\n*   **4. Corpus Appropriateness (Score: 1.0 / 1.0):** The framework's stated purpose is to \"validate system functionality with minimal computational cost,\" and its target is \"short text documents with clear emotional content.\" The `nano` corpus, with two simple test files, is an ideal match for this purpose.\n\n---\n\n#### **Overall Framework-Corpus Fit Score: 0.98**\n\n**Calculation:** (0.90 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0) / 4 = 0.975\n\n**Interpretation:** A fit score of **0.98** is exceptional and indicates that the framework is functioning exactly as intended for its specific use case of pipeline validation. The corpus provided the ideal conditions to confirm the framework's basic discriminative power and theoretical coherence. This result provides high confidence in the technical functionality of the scoring pipeline. However, it offers no insight into how the framework would perform on more complex, ambiguous, or diverse real-world texts.",
