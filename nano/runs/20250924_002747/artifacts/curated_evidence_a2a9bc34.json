The terms \"unqualified triumph,\" \"vibrant,\" and \"bustling hub\" are strong indicators of positive sentiment.\n*   **Strength rating:** 5\n\n*   **Document index:** 0\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"Local businesses are reporting record foot traffic, and the influx of new residents and visitors has created an atmosphere of palpable optimism and energy that promises a bright and prosperous future for all.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Reinforces the high `positive_sentiment` score for Document 0. Phrases like \"record foot traffic,\" \"palpable optimism and energy,\" and \"bright and prosperous future\" clearly demonstrate strong positive sentiment, contributing to the perfect discrimination.\n*   **Strength rating:** 5\n\n*   **Document index:** 0\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"This initiative serves as a powerful testament to what can be achieved when bold vision is paired with thoughtful execution, creating a legacy of economic vitality and environmental stewardship that will benefit generations to come.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Further exemplifies the high `positive_sentiment` of Document 0. \"Powerful testament,\" \"bold vision,\" \"thoughtful execution,\" \"economic vitality,\" and \"benefit generations\" are all highly positive descriptors, providing strong evidence for the framework's ability to discriminate positive content.\n*   **Strength rating:** 5\n\n*   **Document index:** 1\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"The proposed industrial zoning changes represent a [negative_sentiment: catastrophic betrayal] of public trust and an [negative_sentiment: assault on our community's well-being].\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Directly supports the high `negative_sentiment` score (1.00) for Document 1 and the perfect discrimination. The explicit use of \"catastrophic betrayal\" and \"assault\" are unequivocal indicators of extreme negative sentiment.\n*   **Strength rating:** 5\n\n*   **Document index:** 1\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"The complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude from officials have only fueled the growing sense of [negative_sentiment: despair and anger].\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Provides strong evidence for the high `negative_sentiment` in Document 1. Terms like \"complete lack of transparency,\" \"dismissive attitude,\" and \"despair and anger\" are intensely negative, clearly demonstrating the framework's ability to identify and score negative content, thus contributing to perfect discrimination.\n*   **Strength rating:** 5\n\n*   **Document index:** 1\n*   **Exact quote text:** \"The long-term consequences of this decision will be [negative_sentiment: devastating and irreversible]. Once the wetlands are destroyed and the industrial complex is built, there will be no going back.\"\n*   **Statistical relevance:** Underscores the high `negative_sentiment` of Document 1. \"Devastating and irreversible\" and \"no going back\" convey a sense of extreme and permanent negative impact, serving as excellent evidence for the framework's perfect discrimination of negative sentiment.\n*   **Strength rating:** 5",
