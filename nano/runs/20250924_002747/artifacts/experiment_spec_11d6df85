# Nano Test Experiment

## Abstract
Minimal pipeline validation with 2 documents and 2 dimensions. Tests basic analysis agent functionality with negligible computational cost.

## Research Questions
- Does the pipeline correctly identify positive vs negative sentiment?
- Can the analysis agent process simple dimensional scoring?

## Expected Outcomes
Clear distinction between positive and negative sentiment scores across the two test documents.
