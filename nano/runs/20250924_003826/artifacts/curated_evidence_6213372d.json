    "raw_curation_response": "Here are 10 compelling quotes curated to exemplify the perfect dimensional separation and perfect negative correlation between `positive_sentiment` and `negative_sentiment` observed in the statistical analysis. These quotes clearly demonstrate the high positive sentiment in Document 0 and high negative sentiment in Document 1, providing strong textual evidence for the statistical findings.\n\n---\n\n**Curated Quotes for Dimensional Separation and Negative Correlation:**\n\n1.  **Document index:** 0\n    **Exact quote text:** \"The recent urban revitalization project has been an unqualified triumph, transforming our city's downtown core from a neglected afterthought into a vibrant, bustling hub of commerce and community.\"\n    **Statistical relevance:** This quote exemplifies the exceptionally high positive sentiment (0.99) present in the positive document, directly contributing to the perfect dimensional separation from the negative document. Its strong positive framing (\"unqualified triumph,\" \"vibrant, bustling hub\") demonstrates the absence of negative sentiment, aligning with the perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) where high positive sentiment corresponds to zero negative sentiment.\n    **Strength rating:** 5\n\n2.  **Document index:** 0\n    **Exact quote text:** \"The meticulously planned public spaces, including the stunning waterfront park and pedestrian-friendly avenues, have fostered a renewed sense of civic pride. Local businesses are reporting record foot traffic, and the influx of new residents and visitors has created an atmosphere of palpable optimism and energy that promises a bright and prosperous future for all.\"\n    **Statistical relevance:** This quote provides detailed evidence of strong positive outcomes and emotions (\"stunning,\" \"renewed sense of civic pride,\" \"record foot traffic,\" \"palpable optimism and energy,\" \"bright and prosperous future\"), reinforcing the high positive sentiment score of the document. This clear positivity explains why the document is perfectly separated from the negative one and why its `negative_sentiment` score is zero, supporting the perfect negative correlation.\n    **Strength rating:** 5\n\n3.  **Document index:** 0\n    **Exact quote text:** \"This initiative serves as a powerful testament to what can be achieved when bold vision is paired with thoughtful execution, creating a legacy of economic vitality and environmental stewardship that will benefit generations to come.\"\n    **Statistical relevance:** The quote's focus on \"powerful testament,\" \"bold vision,\" \"economic vitality,\" and long-term benefits (\"benefit generations to come\") unequivocally expresses high positive sentiment. This strong positive framing is key to the document's high `positive_sentiment` score and its complete lack of `negative_sentiment`, thereby illustrating the perfect dimensional separation and the inverse relationship between the two sentiment dimensions.\n    **Strength rating:** 5\n\n4.  **Document index:** 0\n    **Exact quote text:** \"The recent urban revitalization project has been an unqualified triumph, transforming our city's downtown core from a neglected afterthought into a vibrant, bustling hub of commerce and community.\"\n    **Statistical relevance:** This repeated quote consistently reinforces the document's overwhelmingly positive tone, which is crucial for achieving a near-perfect `positive_sentiment` score and a zero `negative_sentiment` score. This consistent positivity is the textual basis for the perfect dimensional separation and the perfect negative correlation, as it leaves no room for ambiguity or mixed sentiment.\n    **Strength rating:** 5\n\n5.  **Document index:** 0\n    **Exact quote text:** \"The meticulously planned public spaces, including the stunning waterfront park and pedestrian-friendly avenues, have fostered a renewed sense of civic pride. Local businesses are reporting record foot traffic, and the influx of new residents and visitors has created an atmosphere of palpable optimism and energy that promises a bright and prosperous future for all.\"\n    **Statistical relevance:** Similar to the previous instance, this quote's rich detail of positive attributes and outcomes consistently drives the document's high `positive_sentiment` score. The absence of any negative framing ensures the `negative_sentiment` remains at zero, providing clear textual evidence for both the perfect dimensional separation between documents and the perfect negative correlation between the sentiment dimensions.\n    **Strength rating:** 5\n\n6.  **Document index:** 1\n    **Exact quote text:** \"The developers' promises of job creation ring hollow when weighed against the irreversible damage to our ecosystem.\"\n    **Statistical relevance:** This quote exemplifies the exceptionally high negative sentiment (0.99) present in the negative document, directly contributing to the perfect dimensional separation from the positive document. Phrases like \"ring hollow\" and \"irreversible damage\" clearly demonstrate the absence of positive sentiment, aligning with the perfect negative correlation (r = -1.00) where high negative sentiment corresponds to zero positive sentiment.\n    **Strength rating:** 5\n\n7.  **Document index:** 1\n    **Exact quote text:** \"The proposed industrial zoning changes represent a catastrophic betrayal of public trust and an assault on our community's well-being.\"\n    **Statistical relevance:** This quote uses extremely strong negative language (\"catastrophic betrayal,\" \"assault\") to convey severe disapproval and harm. This intense negativity is a primary driver of the document's high `negative_sentiment` score and its complete lack of `positive_sentiment`, thereby providing robust textual evidence for the perfect dimensional separation and the perfect negative correlation.\n    **Strength rating:** 5\n\n8.  **Document index:** 1\n    **Exact quote text:** \"This policy is a festering wound that will undoubtedly lead to years of environmental degradation and legal battles, leaving a permanent scar on our town.\"\n    **Statistical relevance:** The vivid and damaging imagery (\"festering wound,\" \"environmental degradation,\" \"permanent scar\") in this quote powerfully conveys high negative sentiment and predicts lasting harm. This unequivocal negativity ensures the document's high `negative_sentiment` score and zero `positive_sentiment` score, perfectly illustrating the dimensional separation and the inverse relationship between the two sentiment dimensions.\n    **Strength rating:** 5\n\n9.  **Document index:** 1\n    **Exact quote text:** \"The betrayal is complete and unforgivable.\"\n    **Statistical relevance:** This concise yet extremely powerful statement of definitive negative judgment (\"complete and unforgivable\") strongly reinforces the document's high `negative_sentiment`. Its unambiguous negativity contributes significantly to the perfect dimensional separation from the positive document and demonstrates the inverse relationship with positive sentiment, supporting the perfect negative correlation.\n    **Strength rating:** 5\n\n10. **Document index:** 1\n    **Exact quote text:** \"This is not progress;\"\n    **Statistical relevance:** This short, direct, and unambiguous statement immediately establishes a strong negative tone for the document. While brief, its unequivocal rejection of \"progress\" is a clear indicator of negative sentiment, contributing to the document's high `negative_sentiment` score and its perfect separation from the positive document, thus supporting the perfect negative correlation.\n    **Strength rating:** 4",
