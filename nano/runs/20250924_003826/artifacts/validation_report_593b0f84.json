      "description": "The `framework.md` file contains an internal metadata `framework_name` of 'sentiment_binary_v1'. This does not align with the standardized filename 'framework.md' that is required by the v10.0 experiment specification and referenced in `experiment.md`. While the system will execute correctly because the file reference is valid, this inconsistency can cause confusion for researchers.",
      "impact": "No direct execution impact, as the file system reference is correct. However, it creates a discrepancy between the file's identity on disk and its internal metadata, which can complicate asset management and manual audits.",
      "fix": "To comply with the v10.0 specification's strict naming convention, update the `framework_name` metadata field inside `framework.md` from 'sentiment_binary_v1' to 'framework'.",

      "description": "The `analysis_prompt` in `framework.md` refers to the dimensions in all caps ('POSITIVE SENTIMENT', 'NEGATIVE SENTIMENT'), while the formal dimension definitions use snake_case ('positive_sentiment', 'negative_sentiment'). Best practices for agent interaction recommend using the exact dimension names to ensure reliable mapping and prevent ambiguity.",
      "impact": "Minor risk of the analysis agent misinterpreting or failing to map scores to the correct dimension in the output schema. While likely to succeed in this simple case, it reduces robustness.",
      "fix": "Update the `analysis_prompt` to use the exact, snake-cased dimension names as defined in the `dimensions` section (e.g., 'positive_sentiment: Look for praise...', 'negative_sentiment: Look for criticism...').",

    "The corpus size of N=2 is perfectly suitable for this experiment's stated goal of pipeline validation. Note that this sample size is not sufficient for statistical inference; experiments designed to produce generalizable statistical claims should use a larger corpus (e.g., N>10 for descriptive statistics, N>30 for robust inferential analysis)."
