**Corpus Name**: Family Moral Systems Political Communications  
**Framework**: Lakoff Framing Framework v10.0  
**Documents**: 4 political communications  
**Date**: August 29, 2025  

---

## Corpus Overview

This corpus contains 4 diverse political communications designed to test Lakoff's family moral systems theory. The documents range from campaign speeches to policy statements, representing different ideological positions and family model orientations. Each text is selected to exercise specific dimensions of the Strict Father vs. Nurturant Parent moral frameworks.

## Document Collection

### 1. Conservative Family Values Speech (synthetic)
**Speaker**: Senator Michael Thompson (R)  
**Context**: Campaign speech on family policy  
**Family Model**: Strict Father (Authority, Competition, Self-Reliance)  
**Content**: Emphasizes parental authority, individual responsibility, and competitive meritocracy in family and economic policy.

### 2. Progressive Family Support Policy (synthetic)  
**Speaker**: Representative Sarah Chen (D)  
**Context**: Policy announcement on family support programs  
**Family Model**: Nurturant Parent (Empathy, Cooperation, Interdependence)  
**Content**: Focuses on collective support, empathetic understanding, and cooperative solutions for family challenges.

### 3. Libertarian Individual Rights Speech (synthetic)
**Speaker**: Governor James Rodriguez (L)  
**Context**: State of the state address  
**Family Model**: Strict Father (Self-Reliance, Authority)  
**Content**: Emphasizes individual autonomy, minimal government intervention, and personal responsibility in family matters.

### 4. Centrist Bipartisan Appeal (synthetic)
**Speaker**: Senator Patricia Williams (I)  
**Context**: Bipartisan legislation announcement  
**Family Model**: Mixed (Balanced approach)  
**Content**: Attempts to bridge family model differences through compromise and shared values.


## Corpus Design Rationale

This corpus is designed to provide maximum analytical leverage for the Lakoff Framing Framework:

1. **Family Model Variation**: Documents represent the full spectrum from pure Strict Father to pure Nurturant Parent orientations
2. **Mixed Models**: Several documents combine elements from both family models to test framework discrimination
3. **Context Diversity**: Different political contexts (campaign, policy, religious, business) to test framework robustness
4. **Strategic Complexity**: Documents with varying levels of strategic moral framework deployment
5. **Analytical Depth**: Sufficient content to exercise all three bipolar dimensions and salience assessment

## Expected Framework Exercise

The corpus will test the framework's ability to:
- Distinguish between Strict Father and Nurturant Parent moral orientations
- Measure the coherence of family model clustering
- Assess strategic deployment of moral frameworks
- Validate Lakoff's cognitive linguistics approach to political analysis

This corpus design ensures comprehensive testing of the framework's analytical capabilities while maintaining the coherence necessary for meaningful research outcomes.
