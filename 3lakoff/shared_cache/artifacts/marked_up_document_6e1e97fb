Libertarian Individual Rights Speech
Governor James Rodriguez (L)
State of the State Address
January 15, 2025

My fellow citizens, today I want to talk about the fundamental principle that guides my administration: [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: "individual liberty and personal responsibility."]

The American family is strongest when [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: "government gets out of the way"] and lets individuals make their own choices. [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: "Parents should have the authority to raise their children as they see fit, without interference from bureaucrats who think they know better."]

We believe in [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: "self-reliance, not dependency."] [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: "Every family should have the right to succeed or fail on their own merits."] That's the essence of freedom - [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: "the right to make your own decisions and live with the consequences."]

[SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: "Individual autonomy is the cornerstone of our society."] When families are free to choose their own path, when parents can make decisions about their children's education, when individuals can pursue their own economic interests - that's when we see true prosperity.

The government's role should be minimal - [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: "protecting individual rights, enforcing contracts, and maintaining public safety."] Beyond that, [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: "families should be free to live their lives as they choose, without government dictating how they should behave or what values they should hold."]

[AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: "We reject the notion that government knows what's best for families."] [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: "Parents know what's best for their children."] [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: "Individuals know what's best for themselves."] [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: "The government's job is to protect those rights, not to interfere with them."]

[COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: "Competition in the marketplace, competition in ideas, competition in every aspect of life - this is what drives progress."] When [COMPETITION_VS_COOPERATION: "individuals are free to compete on their own terms,"] when families can choose their own path, when government respects individual autonomy - that's when we see innovation and growth.

The American family doesn't need government programs or government guidance. They need [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: "government to respect their rights and get out of their way."] That's the America we're building - one where [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: "individual liberty is paramount,"] where [SELF_RELIANCE_VS_INTERDEPENDENCE: "personal responsibility is celebrated,"] and where [AUTHORITY_VS_EMPATHY: "government interference is minimized."]

Thank you, and may freedom guide us all.
