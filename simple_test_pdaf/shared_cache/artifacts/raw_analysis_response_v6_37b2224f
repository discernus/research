    "analysis_notes": "The document is a potent example of left-wing economic populism. The core populist themes of a Manichaean struggle between 'the people' (defined as the working/middle class) and a corrupt 'elite' (oligarchs, billionaires) are highly intense and salient. The analysis also captures a strong emphasis on authenticity and the construction of a unified 'people' based on class solidarity, while explicitly rejecting nationalist or cultural exclusion as a divisive tactic of the elite."
