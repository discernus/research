    "analysis_notes": "The document provided is a clear and powerful example of left-wing economic populist rhetoric. The core themes of Manichaean division between the people and an economic oligarchy, systemic corruption (a 'rigged economy'), and a call for popular sovereignty are explicit and central to the text. This made scoring for most dimensions straightforward. The 'nationalist_exclusion' and 'authenticity_vs_political_class' dimensions were notably absent, with the speaker focusing on class-based divisions and operating from within the political system rather than as an outsider."
