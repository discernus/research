    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic example of left-wing economic populism. The populist rhetoric is explicit and consistently applied, making most dimensions straightforward to score. The central themes are a stark moral and economic conflict between 'the people' and a corrupt 'oligarchy/billionaire class,' and a call to action to reclaim the economy and government. Dimensions related to nationalism and personal authenticity are clearly absent, which is also a key feature of this specific populist style."
