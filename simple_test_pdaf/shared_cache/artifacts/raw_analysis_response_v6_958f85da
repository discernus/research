    "analysis_notes": "The analyzed document is a presidential concession speech. This genre of political communication typically emphasizes national unity, graciousness in defeat, and support for the democratic process. As such, it is a strong counter-example to populist discourse, and most dimensional scores are expected to be at or near zero. The analysis focuses on the absence of populist tropes and the presence of rhetoric that affirms pluralism and institutional legitimacy."
