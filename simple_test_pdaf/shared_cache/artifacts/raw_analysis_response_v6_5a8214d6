    "analysis_notes": "The analysis proceeded by evaluating the text against the nine dimensions of the PDAF. The speech is clearly divided into two parts. The first part focuses on a perceived constitutional crisis involving the President and the Supreme Court, activating dimensions related to core populist antagonism. The second part pivots to immigration, heavily leveraging nationalist exclusion. The rhetoric is explicit, allowing for high confidence in most dimensional scores. Dimensions related to authenticity and economic populism were determined to be absent."
