    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic example of left-wing economic populism. The analysis identified extremely strong and salient themes of Manichaean framing (people vs. oligarchs), systemic corruption (rigged economy), and a call for change based on the will of a unified populace. The nationalist exclusion dimension is completely absent, reinforcing the document's internal, class-based conflict narrative."
