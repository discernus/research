    "analysis_notes": "The document is a political speech with a clear and strong populist rhetorical structure, primarily focused on left-wing economic populism. The core argument is a Manichaean struggle between an economic oligarchy and the working class, making dimensions related to people-elite framing, systemic corruption, and economic appeals highly salient. Conversely, dimensions related to nationalism and homogeneous cultural identity are explicitly rejected or absent, leading to low scores."
