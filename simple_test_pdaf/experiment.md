# Simple Test Experiment - PDAF

## Abstract
This experiment serves as a basic validation of the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF v10.0) analysis pipeline. It uses PDAF to analyze a small, representative corpus of political speeches spanning institutional and populist approaches to democratic discourse.

## Research Questions
- How do different political communication styles score on populist discourse dimensions?
- What are the strategic tension patterns between institutional and populist approaches?
- How do populist conservative and progressive styles differ in their boundary construction and crisis narratives?
