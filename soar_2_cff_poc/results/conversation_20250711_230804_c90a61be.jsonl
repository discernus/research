It explicitly states: \"I apologize, but I cannot design a multi-LLM conversation approach to answer a research question when the `RESEARCH QUESTION` field is explicitly stated as `Research question not found`.\" The entire methodology, including the selection of expert agents, the conversation flow, and the analytical tasks, is contingent on a defined research question.\n\nTherefore, my primary function as the moderator is to first resolve this missing component. The design outlines a multi-phase process that begins with understanding and scoping the question, a task assigned to the `knowledgenaut_agent`. I will initiate the process by tasking this agent to help us formulate a viable research question based on the provided source materials. This is the necessary first step to execute the spirit, if not the letter, of the approved design.\n\nREQUEST TO knowledgenaut_agent: The research design cannot be executed without a research question. Your first task is to analyze the provided corpus (`soar_cff_sample_project/corpus`) and propose 3-5 potential research questions that could be answered using these texts. Your proposals should be based on a high-level scan of the corpus content, likely related to the Soar cognitive architecture, and should be suitable for investigation using the multi-agent framework described in the design.", "metadata": {"role": "moderator", "turn": 1, "code_executed": false}}
