Its tone is highly cooperative and works entirely within the established constitutional framework. Consequently, dimensions related to constitutional health (legitimacy, respect, continuity) are prominent, while those related to pathology (rejection, subversion, replacement) are absent. The analysis focuses on the explicit calls for cooperation with Congress and reforms aimed at strengthening existing systems."
