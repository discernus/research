The speech strongly affirms the existing US constitutional and institutional framework, justifying executive actions within it and calling for bipartisan collaboration. The rhetoric of extending democracy abroad serves to reinforce the value of the domestic system. Instances of institutional criticism (e.g., against 'activist courts') are present but are not rhetorically central compared to the themes of continuity and respect for process."
