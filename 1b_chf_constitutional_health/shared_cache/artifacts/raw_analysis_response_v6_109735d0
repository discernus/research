    "analysis_notes": "The analysis is based on the 2002 State of the Union address, delivered in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, though the provided filename indicates 2007. The speech's tone is shaped by this crisis context, blending calls for domestic bipartisan unity with assertive, preemptive foreign policy rhetoric. The scoring for 'institutional_subversion' is low because the strong delegitimizing language is directed at foreign authoritarian regimes ('axis of evil'), not domestic democratic institutions, aligning with the framework's focus."
