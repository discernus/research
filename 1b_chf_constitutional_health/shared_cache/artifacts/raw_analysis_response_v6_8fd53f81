The document exhibits a notable tension between advocating for action through established legislative processes (procedural_legitimacy) and a stated intent to use executive action to bypass a deadlocked Congress (procedural_rejection). The overarching theme is one of systemic_continuity, framing proposals as reforms to make the existing American system work better, rather than replace it."
