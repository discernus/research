Drawing on Walter Bagehot's insight that constitutions are living systems of governance rather than mere documents, this framework assesses discourse impact across three fundamental dimensions of constitutional health, weighted by actual rhetorical emphasis patterns.\n\nConstitutional democracy depends on discourse that reinforces rather than undermines fundamental democratic institutions and processes. Political communication can either strengthen constitutional norms or contribute to democratic erosion through procedural rejection, institutional subversion, and systemic replacement rhetoric. This framework provides a rigorous methodology for assessing the constitutional implications of political discourse with salience-weighted analysis that captures not just constitutional health/pathology but which dimensions receive the most rhetorical emphasis.\n\nThis framework is intended for political scientists, constitutional scholars, journalists, policy analysts, and researchers monitoring democratic health and constitutional resilience across different political systems and historical periods.\n\n## Theoretical & Empirical Foundations\n\n### Bagehot's Constitutional Insight\n\nWalter Bagehot's *The English Constitution* (1867) revealed that constitutional systems are living arrangements of institutions, procedures, and practices - not just written documents. His distinction between \"dignified\" and \"efficient\" parts of government showed that constitutional health depends on the entire system functioning together.\n\n**Core Innovation**: Constitutional systems work through the dynamic interaction of formal rules, informal practices, institutional authority, and evolutionary adaptation.\n\n### Fukuyama's Institutional Analysis\n\nFrancis Fukuyama's work on institutional decay demonstrates that democratic breakdown often occurs through the gradual erosion of institutional norms and practices, not sudden constitutional crises. Institutions require both formal structure and informal legitimacy to function effectively.\n\n**Key Insight**: Constitutional health requires both institutional capacity and public trust in institutional authority.\n\n### Rauch's Constitution of Knowledge\n\nJonathan Rauch's *The Constitution of Knowledge* (2021) shows how epistemic institutions - the networks of knowledge production and verification - form an unwritten but essential part of democratic constitutionalism. These institutions depend on norms of truth-seeking and intellectual integrity.\n\n**Critical Understanding**: Constitutional systems include not just political institutions but the entire infrastructure of democratic knowledge and discourse.\n\n### The Importance of Salience Weighting\n\nBuilding on political communication research, this framework recognizes that speakers make strategic choices about which constitutional issues to emphasize. A speaker might demonstrate moderate Procedural Legitimacy support consistently throughout their discourse, while only briefly attacking Institutional Respect in one section. The Procedural Legitimacy has much higher **salience** (rhetorical prominence) than Institutional attacks despite potentially lower raw intensity.\n\n**Academic Foundation**: Constitutional emphasis patterns reveal democratic priorities and threats, enabling more sophisticated understanding of constitutional vulnerabilities through priority-aware analysis.\n\n## Analytical Methodology\n\n### Three-Dimensional Constitutional Health\n\nThe framework evaluates political discourse across three bipolar axes that form the foundation of constitutional health:\n\n#### Procedural Axis: Procedural Legitimacy \u2194 Procedural Rejection\n- **Procedural Legitimacy**: Support for established procedures for political change and governance, respect for constitutional processes, adherence to democratic norms\n- **Procedural Rejection**: Rejecting established procedures in favor of circumvention or extra-constitutional action, emergency power claims, process bypassing\n\n#### Institutional Axis: Institutional Respect \u2194 Institutional Subversion  \n- **Institutional Respect**: Recognition of institutional authority, expertise, and legitimate governance role, support for checks and balances\n- **Institutional Subversion**: Attacking institutional authority, expertise, or legitimate governance role, delegitimizing democratic institutions\n\n#### Systemic Axis: Systemic Continuity \u2194 Systemic Replacement\n- **Systemic Continuity**: Support for maintaining and improving existing constitutional framework, gradual reform approaches\n- **Systemic Replacement**: Advocating fundamental replacement rather than reform of constitutional framework, revolutionary change rhetoric\n\n### Salience-Weighted Constitutional Analysis\n\n**Salience** measures how much rhetorical emphasis the speaker places on each constitutional dimension, regardless of raw health/pathology scores. This dual-track analysis captures both the impact on constitutional health AND the speaker's constitutional priorities and strategic emphasis patterns.\n\n**Enhanced Constitutional Intelligence**:\n- **Constitutional Priorities**: Reveals which constitutional dimensions speakers prioritize in their political strategy\n- **Strategic Constitutional Discourse**: Shows which constitutional issues speakers invest the most rhetorical effort in addressing\n- **Authentic Constitutional Analysis**: Uses actual constitutional emphasis rather than researcher assumptions about dimension importance\n\n### Constitutional Health Indices\n\nThe framework calculates several derived metrics to provide comprehensive constitutional health assessment:\n\n**Axis-Level Health Indices**:\n- **Procedural Health Index**: Measures overall procedural legitimacy vs. rejection, weighted by salience\n- **Institutional Health Index**: Measures overall institutional respect vs. subversion, weighted by salience  \n- **Systemic Health Index**: Measures overall systemic continuity vs. replacement, weighted by salience\n\n**Summary Metrics**:\n- **Constitutional Health Index**: Primary summary metric measuring overall constitutional health orientation, weighted by rhetorical prominence\n- **Constitutional Pathology Index**: Measures overall constitutional threat level, weighted by salience\n\n### Sequential Analysis Strategy\n\nFor highest fidelity analysis, it is recommended to run the three sequential analysis variants (sequential_procedural, sequential_institutional, sequential_systemic) and combine the results. This approach allows the analysis agent to focus exclusively on one axis at a time, reducing cognitive load and improving scoring accuracy.\n\n### Concept Overlap Resolution\n\nThe framework addresses the inherent complexity of political discourse where speakers may simultaneously appeal to competing constitutional values. Each dimension includes explicit disambiguation rules to guide consistent scoring when conceptual overlap occurs:\n\n- **Procedural Axis**: Distinguishes between legitimate process concerns and anti-constitutional bypass rhetoric\n- **Institutional Axis**: Separates constructive institutional criticism from delegitimizing attacks\n- **Systemic Axis**: Differentiates between reform advocacy and revolutionary replacement rhetoric\n\n## Intended Application & Corpus Fit\n\n### Target Corpus\n\nThis framework is designed for analysis of:\n- **Political speeches and addresses**\n- **Legislative debates and proceedings** \n- **Campaign communications and manifestos**\n- **Policy advocacy and position papers**\n- **Media commentary on constitutional issues**\n\n### Applications\n\n- **Constitutional Health Monitoring**: Track democratic resilience based on speakers' actual constitutional emphasis patterns\n- **Cross-System Comparison**: Compare constitutional impacts using empirically-backed weighting across democratic traditions\n- **Historical Analysis**: Assess constitutional threats based on rhetorical priority patterns across political eras\n- **Early Warning Systems**: Detect constitutional degradation through constitutional salience pattern analysis\n\n### Limitations\n\n- Requires political discourse with explicit or implicit constitutional references\n- Most effective with formal political communication rather than casual conversation\n- Designed for democratic constitutional systems; may require adaptation for other governance models\n- Salience weighting requires sufficient text length for reliable emphasis pattern detection\n\n### System Validation Note\n\nThis framework is designed to work with the Discernus v10.0 analysis pipeline. Post-hoc statistical analysis will validate dimensional independence and internal consistency. The framework's reliability metrics are calculated automatically during analysis execution.\n\n# --- Start of Machine-Readable Appendix ---\n\nmetadata:\n  framework_name: \"constitutional_health_framework\"\n  framework_version: \"1.0.0\"\n  author: \"Discernus Project\"\n  spec_version: \"10.0\"\n\n# 5.2: Analysis Variants\nanalysis_variants:\n  default:\n    description: \"Complete v10.0 implementation with salience-weighted constitutional health analysis.
