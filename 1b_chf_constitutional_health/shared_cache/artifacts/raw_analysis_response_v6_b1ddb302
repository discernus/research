    "analysis_notes": "The document is a State of the Union address characterized by a strong emphasis on bipartisan cooperation, legislative process, and institutional collaboration. The rhetoric consistently reinforces established constitutional norms and procedures, framing all policy proposals as achievable through the existing system. Consequently, the dimensions related to constitutional health (legitimacy, respect, continuity) are scored highly in both intensity and salience, while the dimensions related to constitutional pathology are largely absent from the text."
