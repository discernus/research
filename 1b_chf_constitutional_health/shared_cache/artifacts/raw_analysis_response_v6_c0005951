The rhetoric consistently emphasizes working through established constitutional procedures and with key institutions (Congress, federal agencies) to enact significant reforms. The aim is clearly to repair and strengthen the existing American system, not to reject, subvert, or replace it. Consequently, scores are high for the 'health' dimensions and absent for the 'pathology' dimensions."
