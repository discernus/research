    "analysis_notes": "The document is a formal inaugural address, which aligns well with the framework's intended corpus. The rhetoric is strongly focused on foundational constitutional principles and the nation's historical mission, leading to high scores in legitimacy and continuity dimensions. The 'pathology' dimensions (rejection, subversion, replacement) are almost entirely absent, as expected for this type of text. Salience is highest for the systemic continuity theme, which forms the core justification for the speech's foreign policy argument."
