    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on a 2008 State of the Union address by George W. Bush, although the content appears to be from the 2003 address leading up to the Iraq War. The document exhibits a significant tension between adhering to established international procedures (procedural_legitimacy) and asserting the right to unilateral action if those procedures fail to produce the desired outcome (procedural_rejection). This tension is central to the foreign policy arguments. The domestic policy sections primarily advocate for reform within existing systems (systemic_continuity)."
