    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on President Clinton's 1993 address to Congress. The speech is a classic example of a call for legislative action and reform within the existing constitutional structure. The rhetoric is heavily weighted towards working through established processes and respecting institutional roles, making the positive dimensions highly salient. Negative dimensions are almost entirely absent, reflecting a commitment to the constitutional system."
