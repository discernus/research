    "analysis_notes": "The document is a State of the Union address emphasizing bipartisan cooperation and adapting the existing American system to new challenges (the 'New Covenant'). It strongly favors procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity. Critiques of government dysfunction are present but are framed as a call for reform from within the system, rather than outright subversion or rejection. Pathological dimensions are therefore scored low to moderate, while health-oriented dimensions are scored high."
