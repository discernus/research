    "analysis_notes": "The analysis reflects the speech's rhetorical strategy of simultaneously invoking traditional institutions and processes (e.g., calls for Congress to legislate) while also delegitimizing elements of the political and administrative establishment ('the swamp', FDA). This results in significant scores on seemingly contradictory dimensions like institutional_respect/institutional_subversion and systemic_continuity/systemic_replacement, which is consistent with the framework's design to capture such tensions."
