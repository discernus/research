    "analysis_notes": "The analysis is based on the content of the provided text, which is President Obama's final State of the Union address from January 2016, despite the filename and date in the header indicating 2013. The speech strongly affirms the American political system, leading to high scores in positive dimensions (legitimacy, respect, continuity) and very low or zero scores in negative dimensions (rejection, subversion, replacement). The salience scores reflect the speech's central themes of overcoming political dysfunction through procedural reform and appealing to the enduring strengths of the American constitutional system."
