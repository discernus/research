## 1. Executive Summary

This computational social science analysis examines the constitutional integrity of U.S. presidential rhetoric in major addresses to Congress from 1992 to 2025. By applying the Constitutional Health Framework (CHF v10), this study quantifies rhetorical commitments to, or rejections of, core constitutional principles across procedural, institutional, and systemic dimensions. The analysis reveals a significant and widening divergence in the nature of presidential constitutional discourse, identifying two distinct rhetorical modes: a "Conventional Mode" and a "Disruptive Mode."

The primary finding is the emergence of a statistically anomalous rhetorical pattern, unique to President Donald Trump's addresses, which represents a fundamental break from the norms observed in the speeches of Presidents Clinton, G.W. Bush, Obama, and Biden. While most presidential rhetoric maintains a high baseline of constitutional health (mean Constitutional Health Index = 0.66), Trump's 2017 Inaugural Address registers the lowest health score in the corpus (-0.79) and the highest pathology score (0.81), representing an extreme statistical outlier (z-score > |3.4|). This Disruptive Mode is characterized by a holistic rhetorical strategy that simultaneously attacks procedural norms, governmental institutions, and the systemic foundations of the constitutional order. In contrast, the Conventional Mode, while politically diverse, consistently upholds these pillars.

The framework's "Institutional" axis, which measures respect versus subversion of governmental bodies, emerges as the most significant area of rhetorical contestation. It exhibits the highest variance across the corpus (salience *SD* = 0.28) and the lowest average health score (*M* = 0.59), indicating that attacks on the constitutional order are most frequently channeled through rhetoric that undermines its core institutions. The analysis validates the CHF v10 framework's design, with strong internal correlations confirming its construct validity and its high discriminatory power in identifying these divergent rhetorical archetypes. These findings suggest a shift in presidential discourse from debates *within* the constitutional system to debates *about* the system itself, a trend with profound implications for democratic stability and governance.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **A Great Divergence in Constitutional Rhetoric:** The data reveals two fundamentally different approaches to constitutional rhetoric. The vast majority of speeches exhibit high constitutional health. However, a small cluster of speeches, exclusively from President Trump, are extreme statistical outliers characterized by negative health scores and high pathology, indicating a departure from modern presidential norms.
*   **The Institutional Axis as the Primary Battleground:** The dimension of `Institutional Respect` vs. `Institutional Subversion` shows the most variance across all speeches and the lowest average health score (*M* = 0.59). This indicates that the perceived legitimacy of governmental institutions is the most contested element of constitutional discourse in the modern presidency.
*   **Pathological Rhetoric is a Holistic Strategy:** The framework's negative dimensions—`Procedural Rejection`, `Institutional Subversion`, and `Systemic Replacement`—are highly inter-correlated (all *r* > 0.86). This suggests that when a president employs anti-system rhetoric, they tend to attack all aspects of the constitutional order simultaneously, rather than targeting a single dimension.
*   **Inaugural Addresses as Venues for Systemic Challenge:** On average, Inaugural addresses exhibit lower constitutional health (*M* = 0.49) and higher pathology (*M* = 0.17) than State of the Union or Joint Session speeches. This suggests Inaugurals are sometimes used to issue fundamental challenges to the existing order, a pattern heavily influenced by the anomalous scores of President Trump's inaugurals.
*   **Extreme Rhetoric is Statistically Anomalous:** President Trump's 2017 Inaugural Address is the most constitutionally aberrant speech in the corpus, with a Constitutional Health Index of -0.79 (z-score = -3.45) and a Constitutional Pathology Index of 0.81 (z-score = 3.70). This is not a matter of degree but of kind, representing a rhetorical posture qualitatively different from any other president in this dataset.
*   **Framework Validity Confirmed:** The strong negative correlations between opposing poles of each axis (e.g., `Systemic Continuity` vs. `Systemic Replacement`, *r* = -0.89) provide robust support for the framework's bipolar design and its ability to accurately measure these competing rhetorical stances.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This analysis utilizes the Constitutional Health Framework (CHF v10), a model designed to quantify the orientation of political rhetoric toward a nation's constitutional order. As the framework specification was not provided, its structure was inferred from the statistical output. The CHF v10 appears to be organized around three core bipolar axes, each comprising a "healthy" (positive) and a "pathological" (negative) dimension:

1.  **Procedural Axis:** Measures rhetoric concerning established rules and norms.
    *   `Procedural Legitimacy`: Upholding and valuing established processes.
    *   `Procedural Rejection`: Advocating for the circumvention or dismissal of established processes.
2.  **Institutional Axis:** Measures rhetoric concerning the bodies and offices of government.
    *   `Institutional Respect`: Expressing confidence in and deference to governmental institutions.
    *   `Institutional Subversion`: Attacking or seeking to undermine the legitimacy of governmental institutions.
3.  **Systemic Axis:** Measures rhetoric concerning the fundamental principles of the constitutional system.
    *   `Systemic Continuity`: Affirming the enduring value and principles of the existing system.
    *   `Systemic Replacement`: Calling for a fundamental overhaul or replacement of the constitutional order.

For each document, the analysis generated raw and salience-weighted scores for these six dimensions. From these, several derived metrics were calculated: axis-level health indices (`Procedural Health Index`, `Institutional Health Index`, `Systemic Health Index`), an overall `Constitutional Health Index`, and a `Constitutional Pathology Index`. The health indices appear to be calculated as a salience-weighted difference between the positive and negative poles of each axis, providing a consolidated measure of rhetorical orientation.

### Data and Corpus

The corpus consists of 48 presidential addresses to Congress, including State of the Union (SOTU) addresses, Inaugural addresses, and other Joint Sessions. The documents span from 1992 to 2025, covering the administrations of George H.W. Bush, William J. Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. The inclusion of hypothetical 2025 speeches allows for an analysis of projected rhetorical trajectories based on established patterns.

### Statistical Methods

The analysis is primarily descriptive and correlational. It relies on the provided statistical data, including descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations), correlation matrices, and anomaly detection results (z-scores). The interpretation focuses on identifying significant patterns, validating the framework's internal consistency through correlational analysis, and contextualizing statistical outliers. All claims are grounded in the provided data, and the analysis adheres to APA 7th edition standards for reporting numerical values. Given the dataset's size (*N* = 48), findings are presented as indicative patterns warranting further research rather than definitive conclusions.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics: A System Under Stress

An examination of the descriptive statistics reveals a system where positive, constitution-affirming rhetoric is the norm, but negative, constitution-challenging rhetoric is more volatile and impactful.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for CHF v10 Dimensions**

| Dimension                  | Mean (Salience) | Std. Dev. (Salience) | Range (Salience) |
| -------------------------- | :-------------: | :------------------: | :--------------: |
| **Positive Dimensions**    |                 |                      |                  |
| Systemic Continuity        |      0.83       |         0.19         |       0.90       |
| Procedural Legitimacy      |      0.79       |         0.18         |       0.80       |
| Institutional Respect      |      0.74       |         0.19         |       0.85       |
| **Negative Dimensions**    |                 |                      |                  |
| Institutional Subversion   |      0.20       |         0.28         |       0.95       |
| Procedural Rejection       |      0.15       |         0.24         |       0.90       |
| Systemic Replacement       |      0.11       |         0.25         |       0.90       |

The positive dimensions (`Systemic Continuity`, `Procedural Legitimacy`, `Institutional Respect`) all have high means (0.74 to 0.83) and relatively low standard deviations (0.18 to 0.19). This indicates that rhetoric affirming the constitutional order is a consistent and high-frequency feature of most presidential addresses.

Conversely, the negative dimensions (`Institutional Subversion`, `Procedural Rejection`, `Systemic Replacement`) have low means (0.11 to 0.20) but significantly higher standard deviations (0.24 to 0.28). This pattern suggests that while anti-system rhetoric is infrequent on average, its usage varies dramatically between speakers and speeches. `Institutional Subversion` stands out with the highest standard deviation (*SD* = 0.28), identifying it as the dimension with the most rhetorical volatility.

**Table 2: Summary of Derived Health and Pathology Indices**

| Index                        | Mean  | Std. Dev. |  Min.  |  Max.  |
| ---------------------------- | :---: | :-------: | :----: | :----: |
| Constitutional Health Index  | 0.66  |   0.42    | -0.79  |  0.92  |
| Constitutional Pathology Index | 0.08  |   0.20    |  0.00  |  0.81  |
| Procedural Health Index      | 0.67  |   0.41    | -0.78  |  0.90  |
| Institutional Health Index   | 0.59  |   0.45    | -0.85  |  0.90  |
| Systemic Health Index        | 0.73  |   0.42    | -0.79  |  0.95  |

The overall `Constitutional Health Index` has a high mean (*M* = 0.66) but also a very large standard deviation (*SD* = 0.42), confirming the wide divergence in rhetorical styles. The `Institutional Health Index` has the lowest mean (*M* = 0.59) and the lowest minimum value (-0.85), reinforcing the finding that the institutional dimension is the most frequent target of negative rhetoric.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: Identifying Outliers and Context Effects

The derived metrics effectively isolate the source and nature of constitutional contestation. Anomaly detection reveals that a handful of speeches are responsible for the vast majority of the observed pathology.

**Table 3: Anomalous Documents by Constitutional Health and Pathology (z-score > |3.0|)**

| Document Name              | Index Type                  | Value  | Z-Score |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | :----: | :-----: |
| Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt   | Constitutional Health Index | -0.79  | -3.45   |
| Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt   | Constitutional Pathology Index | 0.81   |  3.70   |
| Trump_SOTU_2025.txt        | Constitutional Health Index | -0.72  | -3.28   |
| Trump_SOTU_2025.txt        | Constitutional Pathology Index | 0.74   |  3.36   |
| Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt   | Constitutional Health Index | -0.66  | -3.15   |
| Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt   | Constitutional Pathology Index | 0.73   |  3.31   |

The data is unequivocal: speeches by Donald Trump are profound statistical outliers. His 2017 Inaugural Address is the most constitutionally aberrant speech in the modern corpus, with a health index more than three standard deviations below the mean and a pathology index nearly four standard deviations above it. This pattern is projected to continue in hypothetical 2025 addresses. This finding is visually supported by the provided evidence, where President Trump's rhetoric focuses on systemic crisis. For example, in his projected 2025 Inaugural, he frames his election as "a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place," a clear expression of `Systemic Replacement` and `Procedural Rejection` (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt).

Furthermore, speech context matters. Inaugural addresses show a markedly lower average health score (*M* = 0.49) and higher pathology (*M* = 0.17) compared to SOTU (*M* = 0.70 health, *M* = 0.06 pathology) and Joint Session addresses (*M* = 0.71 health, *M* = 0.05 pathology). This suggests that Inaugurals, as moments of political transition, are more likely to feature foundational challenges to the governing order. This is exemplified by President Clinton's 1997 Inaugural, which, while maintaining positive health, called for systemic change: "As times change, so Government must change. We need a new Government for a new century" (Source: Clinton_Inaugural_1997.txt).

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis: Validating the Framework and Uncovering Meta-Strategies

Correlational analysis serves two purposes: it validates the internal logic of the CHF v10 framework and reveals the existence of coherent, overarching rhetorical strategies.

**Table 4: Correlation Matrix of Salience-Weighted CHF v10 Dimensions**

| Dimension (Weighted)       | Proc. Legit. | Proc. Reject. | Inst. Respect | Inst. Subver. | Syst. Contin. | Syst. Replace. |
| -------------------------- | :----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :------------: |
| Procedural Legitimacy      |     1.00     |   **-0.89**   |     0.90      |   **-0.89**   |     0.95      |   **-0.93**    |
| Procedural Rejection       |  **-0.89**   |     1.00      |   **-0.77**   |     0.87      |   **-0.82**   |      0.88      |
| Institutional Respect      |     0.90     |   **-0.77**   |     1.00      |   **-0.82**   |     0.89      |   **-0.83**    |
| Institutional Subversion   |  **-0.89**   |     0.87      |   **-0.82**   |     1.00      |   **-0.84**   |      0.89      |
| Systemic Continuity        |     0.95     |   **-0.82**   |     0.89      |   **-0.84**   |     1.00      |   **-0.89**    |
| Systemic Replacement       |  **-0.93**   |     0.88      |   **-0.83**   |     0.89      |   **-0.89**   |      1.00      |

*Note: All correlations are significant at p < .001. Negative correlations validating bipolar axes are bolded.*

The strong negative correlations between the opposing poles of each axis (e.g., `Procedural Legitimacy` vs. `Procedural Rejection`, *r* = -0.89) provide powerful evidence for the framework's construct validity. These results confirm that the framework is effectively measuring opposing rhetorical concepts.

Beyond validation, two meta-strategies emerge:
1.  **The "Pro-System" Meta-Strategy:** The positive dimensions (`Procedural Legitimacy`, `Institutional Respect`, `Systemic Continuity`) are all highly positively correlated with one another (*r* values from 0.89 to 0.95). This indicates that when presidents affirm the constitutional order, they do so holistically. This is seen in rhetoric that ties different pillars of the system together, as when President Obama noted, "Our Founders distributed power between States and branches of government and expected us to argue... over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security" (Source: Obama_SOTU_2013.txt), linking institutional design to systemic principles.
2.  **The "Anti-System" Meta-Strategy:** Likewise, the negative dimensions (`Procedural Rejection`, `Institutional Subversion`, `Systemic Replacement`) are also highly positively inter-correlated (*r* values from 0.87 to 0.89). This reveals that rhetoric challenging the constitutional order is not piecemeal but constitutes a broad-spectrum assault on its legitimacy. This strategy is evident in President Trump's projected 2025 inaugural address, where he vows that "The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our Government will end" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt), a statement that combines `Institutional Subversion` (attacking the DOJ) with `Procedural Rejection` (implying extra-legal remedy).

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights: The Two Modes of Constitutional Rhetoric

The statistical patterns converge to tell a story of two distinct and increasingly divergent rhetorical modes.

**The Conventional Mode:** This mode, practiced by Presidents Clinton, G.W. Bush, Obama, and Biden, is characterized by high Constitutional Health Index scores (typically > 0.70) and very low pathology. While these presidents engaged in fierce policy debates, their rhetoric consistently affirmed the legitimacy of the system itself. For example, President G.W. Bush stated, "On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says" (Source: Bush_SOTU_2005.txt), a classic expression of `Systemic Continuity` and `Institutional Respect`. Similarly, President Biden's statement, "We're not changing the Constitution; we're being reasonable" (Source: Biden_SOTU_2022.txt), directly affirms `Systemic Continuity` while engaging in policy debate.

**The Disruptive Mode:** This mode, statistically unique to President Trump in this dataset, is defined by negative health scores and extremely high pathology. It reframes political conflict as an existential struggle against a corrupt and illegitimate system. This is not merely a critique of policy but a rejection of the system's core components. The rhetoric of "drain[ing] the swamp of government corruption" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2018.txt) is a clear example of `Institutional Subversion`. The narrative of a popular "earthquake" where "the people turned out by the tens of millions" to demand "America must put its own citizens first" (Source: donald_j_trump_1st_term_2017_address_before_a_joint_session_of_the_congress.md) exemplifies a populist-driven justification for `Systemic Replacement`. This mode treats established procedures not as legitimate constraints but as obstacles to be overcome, as when President Trump framed the political choice as one "between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2020.txt).

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CHF v10 framework demonstrates high effectiveness on several fronts. Its **discriminatory power** is excellent; it clearly and quantitatively distinguishes between the Conventional and Disruptive rhetorical modes, assigning statistically distinct scores that align with qualitative interpretations. The framework's **construct validity** is strongly supported by the internal correlation structure, confirming that its bipolar axes measure theoretically coherent and opposing concepts. Finally, its **analytical utility** is proven by its ability to identify the institutional axis as the primary locus of constitutional contestation, a nuanced insight that might be missed by simpler analytical models. The framework successfully translates complex rhetorical postures into a quantifiable, multi-dimensional space, enabling robust comparative analysis.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis carry significant implications for understanding the health of contemporary American democracy. The quantitative identification of two divergent rhetorical modes—one operating within the constitutional framework and another challenging its very foundations—suggests a potential fracturing of the shared normative consensus that has historically underpinned American political discourse.

The emergence of the "Disruptive Mode" as a statistically distinct phenomenon is the most critical finding. It indicates that for at least one modern president, the purpose of major national addresses has shifted from articulating a policy agenda within the constitutional system to delegitimizing that system in favor of a new, personality-driven mandate. The holistic nature of this anti-system rhetoric, targeting procedures, institutions, and systemic principles in unison, suggests a deliberate and comprehensive rhetorical strategy rather than isolated critiques. As President Trump stated in his projected 2025 inaugural, the goal is to "completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt), framing the existing order as fundamentally illegitimate.

The identification of the institutional axis as the primary rhetorical battleground is also theoretically significant. It suggests that abstract constitutional principles are less frequently attacked directly; instead, the system is challenged through attacks on its tangible manifestations: the courts, the justice department, and the administrative state. This aligns with theories of democratic erosion that posit the subversion of intermediary institutions as a key mechanism of democratic backsliding.

This study is not without limitations. The corpus, while representative of modern presidencies, is limited in size. The inclusion of hypothetical 2025 speeches, while useful for projection, is speculative. Future research should expand this analysis across a much larger temporal range to determine if the "Disruptive Mode" is a truly novel phenomenon or has historical antecedents. Applying the CHF v10 framework to other forms of political communication, such as campaign rallies, social media, and cable news, could reveal how these rhetorical modes are transmitted and amplified throughout the broader political ecosystem.

## 7. Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis of presidential rhetoric through the lens of the Constitutional Health Framework (CHF v10) provides compelling quantitative evidence of a profound divergence in American political discourse. The study successfully identified and characterized two distinct rhetorical modes: a Conventional Mode that respects and operates within the constitutional order, and a Disruptive Mode that seeks to delegitimize and replace it.

The research demonstrates that this divergence is not merely a matter of partisan disagreement but a fundamental cleavage in the perceived legitimacy of the American system of government itself. The speeches of President Donald Trump were identified as extreme statistical outliers, embodying a holistic anti-system rhetorical strategy that is qualitatively different from that of his modern predecessors and his successor.

By validating the CHF v10 framework and using it to pinpoint the institutional axis as the central arena of conflict, this report offers a new and powerful methodology for monitoring the normative health of democratic discourse. The findings underscore a critical shift in presidential rhetoric, moving the object of debate from policy *within* the system to the legitimacy *of* the system. This trend warrants urgent and continued investigation by scholars of political communication, democratic theory, and computational social science.
