The speech overwhelmingly supports existing procedures, institutions, and the system, with calls for reform and improvement rather than fundamental change or rejection. The 'executive action' mention under procedural_rejection is noted as a boundary case, interpreted as a within-system response to legislative inaction, not a broad rejection of procedure."
