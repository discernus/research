The speech strongly emphasizes working within established processes and institutions, highlighting achievements through bipartisanship and advocating for systemic continuity through gradual reform and strengthening existing frameworks. Critiques were identified as policy disagreements or calls for accountability within the system, not subversion or rejection of the constitutional order."
