    "analysis_notes": "The analysis is based on a State of the Union address, a genre of political discourse that inherently reinforces constitutional processes and institutional roles. The scoring reflects this context. The primary focus of the speech is on systemic continuity through the reform of major institutions like Social Security, the Tax Code, and immigration laws. Pathological dimensions are present but have very low intensity and salience, with the exception of a specific jab at 'activist judges' which elevates the 'institutional_subversion' score slightly."
