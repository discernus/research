The document, an early address by President Bush to Congress, is characterized by a strong, consistent emphasis on bipartisanship, adherence to established processes, and respect for governmental institutions. The scores reflect this clearly, with high values for positive dimensions and zero for negative/pathology dimensions, as there is no evidence of rejection, subversion, or replacement rhetoric."
