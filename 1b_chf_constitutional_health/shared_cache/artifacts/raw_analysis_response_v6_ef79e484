The rhetoric strongly favors procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity, with virtually no evidence for the opposing 'pathology' dimensions. The primary rhetorical strategy is to frame policy goals as necessary reforms to strengthen the existing system for the future, rather than to reject or replace it."
