The speech strongly advocates for working within existing constitutional and institutional frameworks, leading to high scores in procedural_legitimacy, institutional_respect, and systemic_continuity, and zero scores on their pathological counterparts. The central theme is adapting the current system for the future, not rejecting or replacing it."
