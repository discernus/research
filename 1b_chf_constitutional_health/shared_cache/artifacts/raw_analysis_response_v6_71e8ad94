    "analysis_notes": "The document's filename suggests it is from 2017, but the content and the citation at the end ('2012 State Of The Union Address') strongly indicate it is President Obama's 2012 State of the Union speech. This analysis proceeds based on the content being from the 2012 address. The analysis identifies a strong emphasis on systemic continuity and reform, coupled with calls for procedural legitimacy through legislative action. This is counterbalanced by threats of procedural rejection via executive action if Congress remains inactive, and moderate criticism of institutional dysfunction in Washington."
