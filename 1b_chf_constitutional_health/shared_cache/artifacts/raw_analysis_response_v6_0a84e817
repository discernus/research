The document is a classic example of presidential rhetoric that primarily operates within and reinforces the existing constitutional system, repeatedly calling on Congress to act. It also contains a notable challenge to a specific congressional procedure (earmarks) through the threat of an Executive Order, representing a mild form of procedural rejection."
