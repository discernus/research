Emphasis was placed on identifying linguistic markers and assessing salience and confidence for each dimension. The document primarily focuses on foreign policy and economic sanctions in response to the conflict in Ukraine, with some discussion on domestic policy related to inflation and economic recovery. The constitutional health aspects are discussed in relation to supporting democratic institutions and processes, rather than direct attacks on them."
