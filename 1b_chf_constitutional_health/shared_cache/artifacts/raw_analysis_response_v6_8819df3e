    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic State of the Union address delivered during a period of economic prosperity. The rhetoric is overwhelmingly focused on policy proposals within the existing constitutional and legislative framework. It strongly emphasizes bipartisan cooperation, respect for institutions, and incremental reform. Consequently, the dimensions of 'procedural_legitimacy', 'institutional_respect', and 'systemic_continuity' are very high in both intensity and salience. The corresponding negative dimensions ('rejection', 'subversion', 'replacement') are entirely absent from the text."
