    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the content of the provided speech, which is President Obama's 2014 State of the Union Address. The text exhibits a significant rhetorical tension between calls for legislative action (procedural_legitimacy) and vows to use executive action to bypass a deadlocked Congress (procedural_rejection). The speech is strongly oriented towards reform within the existing constitutional system (systemic_continuity) with no evidence of subversive or replacement rhetoric."
