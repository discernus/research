The analysis focuses on differentiating calls for policy reform (e.g., healthcare, welfare) from attacks on or proposals to replace the constitutional system itself, as per framework guidelines. The language of 'revolutionize' is interpreted as policy hyperbole rather than a call for systemic replacement."
