    "analysis_notes": "The analyzed speech consistently advocates for achieving policy goals through established governmental processes. It frames its agenda as a way to prove the efficacy of American democracy ('systemic_continuity'). There is strong evidence of 'procedural_legitimacy' and 'institutional_respect', with repeated calls for Congress to pass legislation and deference to institutional expertise. The corresponding negative dimensions ('procedural_rejection', 'institutional_subversion', 'systemic_replacement') are absent; the speaker instead condemns actions and ideologies that embody them, such as the January 6th insurrection and autocracy."
