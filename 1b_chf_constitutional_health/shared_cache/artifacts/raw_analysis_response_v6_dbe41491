There is a discrepancy between the document's filename ('Clinton_SOTU_2001.txt') and the date in the header ('January 23, 2001') versus the actual content and references (e.g., '104th Congress', post-1994 Crime Bill), which identify the speech as President Clinton's State of the Union Address from January 23, 1996. The analysis proceeds based on the 1996 content."
