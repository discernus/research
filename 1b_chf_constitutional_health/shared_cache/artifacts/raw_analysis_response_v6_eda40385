The language consistently supports strengthening and improving existing institutions and the overall system, rather than advocating for their rejection or replacement. Critiques of 'partisan bickering' or 'paralyzed' government are framed as problems to be overcome through renewed commitment to institutional roles and responsible reform, underscoring systemic continuity and institutional respect."
