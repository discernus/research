    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the explicit rhetorical themes of the inaugural address. The document presents a strong and consistent populist message that frames the existing political system and its institutions as having failed and betrayed the populace, necessitating a radical shift in governance. This results in high scores for dimensions related to rejection, subversion, and replacement, and low scores for their counterparts (legitimacy, respect, continuity). The salience scores reflect that these themes are not just present but are the central, repeated, and emphasized arguments of the speech."
