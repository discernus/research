    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the President's role as a partner with Congress, repeatedly calling for legislative action on a range of reform-oriented proposals. The speech strongly emphasizes procedural legitimacy and systemic continuity. A notable counterpoint is the conditional threat of executive action on climate change if Congress fails to act, representing a moderate degree of procedural rejection. The rhetoric is almost entirely focused on working within and improving existing systems, with no evidence of systemic replacement or institutional subversion."
