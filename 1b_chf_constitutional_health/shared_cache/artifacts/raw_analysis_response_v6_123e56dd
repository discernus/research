    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on a formal State of the Union address, which aligns well with the framework's intended corpus. The document exhibits strong themes of legislative process, institutional cooperation, and systemic renewal, making the positive dimensions highly evident. Conversely, rhetoric associated with the negative dimensions (rejection, subversion, replacement) is largely absent. The primary challenge was disambiguating strong calls for policy reform (e.g., 'revolutionize our welfare system') from calls for systemic replacement, but the context consistently indicated reform within the existing constitutional structure."
