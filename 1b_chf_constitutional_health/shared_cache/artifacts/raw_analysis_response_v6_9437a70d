The speech consistently emphasizes working within the existing framework and institutions, promoting continuity and established procedures. Calls for 'reform' are framed as improvements within the system, not revolutionary change. Critiques of bureaucracy are presented as practical improvements rather than fundamental attacks on institutional legitimacy."
