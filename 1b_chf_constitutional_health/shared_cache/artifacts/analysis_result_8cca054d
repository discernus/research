The discourse is characterized by appeals to bipartisanship, calls for legislative action through established processes, and a central theme of reforming government to adapt to a new era (the 'New Covenant'). This results in high scores for procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity. There is also a notable, but secondary, theme of institutional subversion, which frames the government as bureaucratic and captured by special interests, thus justifying the proposed reforms. Rhetoric supporting procedural rejection or systemic replacement is absent.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"Clinton_SOTU_2000.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"procedural_legitimacy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"procedural_rejection\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"institutional_respect\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"institutional_subversion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.7,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"systemic_continuity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"systemic_replacement\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 1.0\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"procedural_legitimacy\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector, and I was proud to sign it yesterday.
