    "analysis_notes": "Analyzed President Bush's 2003 State of the Union address, focusing on rhetoric related to constitutional health dimensions. The speech strongly emphasized supporting existing institutions, procedures, and gradual improvements, both domestically and in promoting democracy abroad. There was no explicit rhetoric advocating for fundamental system replacement or rejection of established procedures by the speaker. Acknowledged public concerns about 'activist courts' were noted but not attributed as the speaker's direct subversion of institutions."
