    "analysis_notes": "The document is a formal political speech (2014 State of the Union Address) that aligns well with the framework's intended corpus. The rhetoric is strongly oriented towards working within and reforming existing constitutional and institutional structures. This results in high scores for the 'health' dimensions (legitimacy, respect, continuity) and zero scores for the corresponding 'pathology' dimensions (rejection, subversion, replacement). Salience is particularly high for Systemic Continuity, as the speech's core argument is framed around a historical narrative of American progress through reform during crises."
