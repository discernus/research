An expert discourse analyst, I will now analyze the provided documents using the specified framework. My analysis will focus on generating raw dimensional scores, assessing salience, providing confidence levels, and extracting direct evidence, adhering strictly to the separation of concerns and dimensional completeness requirements. All mathematical computations are deferred to downstream processes.

    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focused on a formal inaugural address, which provides clear rhetorical signals aligning with the framework's dimensions. The speech's central theme of 'renewal to preserve' American ideals provides strong, explicit evidence for systemic continuity and procedural legitimacy, while showing minimal to no evidence for the opposing pathological dimensions. The critique of political practice was scored as low institutional subversion, per the disambiguation guidelines distinguishing it from delegitimizing attacks."
