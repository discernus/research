    "analysis_notes": "The analysis reflects a speech delivered in the context of a newly divided government. The text is overwhelmingly characterized by appeals for bipartisan cooperation, adherence to legislative and constitutional processes, and respect for institutional roles. The dominant themes are procedural legitimacy and institutional respect, with a strong undercurrent of systemic continuity through proposed reforms. There is a near-total absence of rhetoric associated with procedural rejection, institutional subversion, or systemic replacement."
