    "analysis_notes": "Analyzed Clinton's 1993 Inaugural Address for its stance on constitutional health dimensions. The speech strongly emphasizes renewal and reform within the existing democratic and institutional framework, showing high levels of procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity. There is no evidence of procedural rejection, institutional subversion, or systemic replacement rhetoric. Some criticisms of political behavior are framed as calls for reform rather than delegitimization."
