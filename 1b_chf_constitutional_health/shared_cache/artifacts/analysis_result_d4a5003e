The scoring reflects the document's consistent appeal to established legislative and institutional processes for domestic policy, contrasted with its description of systemic collapse abroad (the Soviet Union). The document scores highly on dimensions related to procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity, as the President's entire domestic agenda is framed as a series of proposals for Congress to enact through standard procedures. Pathological dimensions (rejection, subversion, replacement) are present at low levels, primarily through critiques of partisan behavior, pork-barrel spending, and isolated rhetorical flourishes like 'revolutionize America's schools'.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"george_bush_1992_address_before_a_joint_session_of_the_congress_on_the_state_of_the_union.md\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"procedural_legitimacy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"procedural_rejection\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.2,\n          \"salience\": 0.2,\n          \"confidence\": 0.9\n        },\n        \"institutional_respect\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"institutional_subversion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.2,\n          \"salience\": 0.3,\n          \"confidence\": 0.85\n        },\n        \"systemic_continuity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"systemic_replacement\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1,\n          \"confidence\": 0.8\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"procedural_legitimacy\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"I submit my plan tomorrow, and I'm asking you to pass it by March 20th.
