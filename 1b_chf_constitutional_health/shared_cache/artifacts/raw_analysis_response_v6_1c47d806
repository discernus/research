    "analysis_notes": "The document exhibits strong tension, particularly on the Procedural axis. The speaker simultaneously appeals to established processes (working with Congress, invoking the UN) while also reserving the right to unilateral, extra-procedural action, especially regarding foreign policy and Iraq. The analysis captures this by scoring both opposing dimensions highly. The Systemic axis is strongly oriented towards continuity and reform within the existing framework, with no rhetoric suggesting systemic replacement for the United States."
