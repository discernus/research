    "analysis_notes": "Analyzed President Obama's 2013 State of the Union address for constitutional health dimensions. The speech consistently emphasizes working within established democratic processes, respecting institutions, and seeking gradual reform and continuity. It strongly rejects rhetoric that bypasses procedures, delegitimizes institutions, or advocates for revolutionary systemic change. The tone is largely optimistic and calls for unity and collective action within the existing framework."
