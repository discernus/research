The analysis distinguishes between advocating for the export of the American system (Systemic Continuity) and advocating for its replacement at home (Systemic Replacement, which is absent). Similarly, controversial executive actions are framed within constitutional authority (Procedural Legitimacy) rather than as a rejection of process."
