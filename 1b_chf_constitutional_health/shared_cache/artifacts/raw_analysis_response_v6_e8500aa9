The rhetoric strongly emphasizes procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity through bipartisan reform. There is a notable absence of rhetoric related to systemic replacement, institutional subversion, or procedural rejection, with only a minor exception regarding a critique of legislative earmarks, which is framed as a reform effort rather than a rejection of the process itself."
