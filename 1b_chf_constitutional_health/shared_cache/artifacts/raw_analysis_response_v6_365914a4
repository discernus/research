It is a paradigmatic example of a leader advocating for policy changes through established constitutional and legislative processes. The analysis strongly reflects high scores in procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity, with negligible scores in their oppositional dimensions. The rhetoric is consistently collaborative and reform-oriented."
