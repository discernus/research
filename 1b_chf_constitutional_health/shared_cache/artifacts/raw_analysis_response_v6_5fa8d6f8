The scoring differentiates between the intensity of a statement (raw_score) and its rhetorical prominence or centrality to the speech's overall message (salience). The speech is characterized by a strong emphasis on working within the existing constitutional framework, albeit with a notable threat of unilateral executive action in one policy area."
