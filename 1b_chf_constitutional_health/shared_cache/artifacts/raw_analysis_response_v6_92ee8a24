The speech's central themes of continuity, responsibility, and adherence to founding principles provide clear evidence for the 'health' dimensions (legitimacy, respect, continuity), which are also the most salient. The 'pathology' dimensions (rejection, subversion, replacement) are either explicitly rejected or entirely absent."
