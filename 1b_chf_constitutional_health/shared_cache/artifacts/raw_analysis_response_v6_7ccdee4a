    "analysis_notes": "The document is a hypothetical inaugural address with highly explicit and rhetorically charged language. This allows for high confidence in scoring across all dimensions. The primary rhetorical strategy is to frame the existing system as corrupt and failed (high institutional_subversion) to justify the use of extra-procedural powers (high procedural_rejection) and systemic changes (high systemic_replacement). Dimensions related to health (legitimacy, respect, continuity) are present but are rhetorically subordinate and have low salience."
