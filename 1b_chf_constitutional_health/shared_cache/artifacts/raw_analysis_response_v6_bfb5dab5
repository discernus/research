    "analysis_notes": "The analysis is based on President Clinton's 1993 address to Congress. The speech is a classic example of a presidential policy proposal, inherently operating within the existing constitutional and procedural framework. The discourse is heavily weighted towards procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity, with virtually no evidence for the opposing 'pathology' dimensions. The salience scores reflect the central rhetorical themes of the speech: using the legislative process, working with Congress, and reforming the existing system to meet future challenges."
