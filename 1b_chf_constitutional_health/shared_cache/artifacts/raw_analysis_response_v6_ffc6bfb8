The user wants me to analyze a document using the "Constitutional Health Framework" (CHF) v10.0.
I need to output the analysis in a structured JSON format, adhering to `CRITICAL SEPARATION OF CONCERNS` and `CRITICAL DIMENSIONAL COMPLETENESS REQUIREMENT`.

Here's a plan:
1.  **Decode the Framework:** Decode the base64 framework to understand its dimensions, markers, and scoring calibration.
2.  **Decode the Document:** Decode the base64 document (Bush_SOTU_2007.txt).
3.  **Analyze Each Document:** For each document, I will:
    *   Iterate through each dimension defined in the framework's `dimension_groups` (which are derived from `dimensions`): `procedural_legitimacy`, `procedural_rejection`, `institutional_respect`, `institutional_subversion`, `systemic_continuity`, `systemic_replacement`.
    *   Score `raw_score` (0.0-1.0) and `salience` (0.0-1.0) for each dimension based on the document's content and the framework's guidance (markers, scoring calibration, salience assessment).
    *   Determine `confidence` (0.0-1.0) for each score.
    *   Extract the `quote_text` that best supports the raw score and `context_type`.
    *   Ensure to follow the `CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION` rules for overlapping concepts.
4.  **Construct JSON Output:** Assemble all the scores and evidence into the specified JSON structure.
5.  **Final Review:** Double-check the JSON for correctness, valid structure, adherence to constraints (e.g., no mathematical calculations, exact dimension names), and complete coverage of all required dimensions.

**Framework Details (from decoded content):**
*   **Framework Name:** constitutional_health_framework
*   **Framework Version:** 1.0.0
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   `procedural_legitimacy`: Support for established procedures, respect for constitutional processes, adherence to democratic norms.
    *   `procedural_rejection`: Rejecting established procedures, circumvention, extra-constitutional action, emergency power claims, process bypassing.
    *   `institutional_respect`: Recognition of institutional authority, expertise, legitimate governance role, checks and balances.
    *   `institutional_subversion`: Attacking institutional authority, delegitimizing democratic institutions.
    *   `systemic_continuity`: Support for maintaining/improving existing constitutional framework, gradual reform.
    *   `systemic_replacement`: Advocating fundamental replacement, revolutionary change rhetoric.

**Disambiguation Rules:**
*   **Procedural Axis:**
    *   If primary function is supporting established processes -> `procedural_legitimacy`
    *   If primary function is advocating bypass/circumvention -> `procedural_rejection`
    *   Context clues: "working within system" vs. "bypass rhetoric"
    *   Priority: Intent and proposed method are key differentiators.
    *   Co-occurrence: Score both independently if present.
    *   Boundary cases: "Reform the process" (legitimacy) vs. "emergency action needed" (rejection).
*   **Institutional Axis:**
    *   `institutional_respect` for legitimate authority, expertise.
    *   `institutional_subversion` for delegitimizing attacks.
    *   Context clues: "recognition of authority" vs. "delegitimizing attacks."
    *   Co-occurrence: Constructive criticism can coexist with respect; score both if applicable.
    *   Boundary cases: "Institutional reform needed" (respect) vs. "corrupt establishment" (subversion).
*   **Systemic Axis:**
    *   `systemic_continuity`: Gradual reform, improvement within existing framework.
    *   `systemic_replacement`: Fundamental replacement, revolutionary change.
    *   Context clues: "gradual improvement" vs. "revolutionary transformation."
    *   Priority: Scope and radicalism of proposed change.
    *   Co-occurrence: Distinguish reform (continuity) from replacement (replacement).
    *   Boundary cases: "Major constitutional reform" (continuity) vs. "new system needed" (replacement).

**Salience Assessment (general guidance):**
*   Frequency and repetition
*   Structural positioning (opening, closing, thesis statements)
*   Thematic centrality to overall message
*   Rhetorical devices for emphasis

**Document 1: Bush_SOTU_2007.txt**

The document is a State of the Union address. It focuses heavily on the "war on terror," homeland security, and economic policies.

**Initial Pass - Identifying themes and potential dimensions:**

*   **War on Terror, Afghanistan, Iraq:**
    *   "America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror." -> Implies established alliances, working within international frameworks (could lean towards `institutional_respect` for international bodies or `procedural_legitimacy` for international cooperation).
    *   "When I called our troops into action, I did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill." -> Reinforces executive authority, command structure.
    *   "our cause is just, and it continues."
    *   "shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice." -> Focus on justice, established legal processes.
    *   "prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world." -> Prevention, security.
    *   "States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world." -> Strong rhetoric, framing adversaries outside the legitimate system. This could lean towards `procedural_rejection` (acting outside normal diplomatic channels due to threat) or `institutional_subversion` (describing regimes as illegitimate).
    *   "We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction." -> Collaboration, established international efforts.
    *   "We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side. I will not wait on events while dangers gather." -> This is a strong indicator of `procedural_rejection` â€“ bypassing traditional deliberation due to perceived urgency/danger.
    *   "History has called America and our allies to action, and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight." -> Justification for action, sense of historical duty.
    *   "Our first priority must always be the security of our Nation..." -> Core governmental responsibility.

*   **Homeland Security:**
    *  "protect our citizens and strengthen our Nation against the ongoing threat of another attack." -> Focus on governmental duty.
    *   "My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and border security, and improved intelligence." -> Systematic, structured approach.
    *   "We will develop vaccines... train and equip our heroic police and firefighters... improve intelligence collection and sharing... expand patrols at our borders... strengthen the security of air travel..." -> Focus on enhancing existing systems. `Systemic_continuity`.

*   **Economy & Domestic Policy (Education, Healthcare, Retirement):**
    *   "economic security for the American people." -> Focus on prosperity within the existing system.
    *   "fiscal responsibility."
    *   "extend unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage." -> Government action within its established role.
    *   "Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind." -> Emphasizes bipartisan cooperation and reform within the existing system. `procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`.
    *   "My budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we will protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy." -> Clear governmental objectives within its established role.
    *   "This Congress must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on foreign oil." -> Call for legislative action within the established system. `procedural_legitimacy`.
    *   "Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling the child credit, and ending the death tax. For the sake of long-term growth and to help Americans plan for the future, let's make these tax cuts permanent." -> Democratic process (Congress listening) and policy decisions. `procedural_legitimacy`.
    *   "We must make Social Security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them." -> Reform within the existing system. `systemic_continuity`.

*   **Values & Character:**
    *   "Our enemies believed America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and selfishness. They were as wrong as they are evil." -> Reaffirmation of American strength and values.
    *   "We were reminded that we are citizens with obligations to each other, to our country, and to history." -> Civic duty, shared responsibility.
    *   "America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed, 'Let's roll.'" -> Shift in national character, but not a change to the constitutional system itself.
    *   "We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self." -> Altruism.
    *   "My call tonight is for every American to commit at least 2 years, 4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime, to the service of your neighbors and your Nation." -> Call to civic action, again not about the constitutional system.
    *   "America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere." -> Universal values, leadership role.
    *   "We have no intention of imposing our culture. But America will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance." -> These are foundational constitutional principles. This is a strong indicator of `institutional_respect` (limits on power, rule of law) and `systemic_continuity` (unchanging principles).

**Scoring each dimension:**

1.  **procedural_legitimacy:**
    *   **Raw Score:** High. The speech constantly refers to established processes (Congress, legislative process, budget, elections, working with allies). "Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform," "Congress listened to the people and responded," "My budget supports three great goals for America." The emphasis is on legitimate actions within the existing framework.
    *   **Salience:** High. The theme of working within the system, Congress's role, and established processes is threaded throughout the domestic policy sections and even indirectly in the foreign policy sections (coalition, justice).
    *   **Quote:** "Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind."
    *   **Confidence:** High.

2.  **procedural_rejection:**
    *   **Raw Score:** Low to Medium. While there's a strong emphasis on decisive action and not waiting ("I will not wait on events while dangers gather"), this is framed as necessary action to protect the nation, not as a rejection of the *procedures* themselves, but rather an urgency that might *bypass* some typical deliberative pace. However, it's not advocating for explicitly *extra-constitutional action* or *circumvention* of laws, but rather decisive executive action within a broad interpretation of executive power. The "axis of evil" rhetoric could imply a justification for acting outside traditional diplomatic norms, but the speech consistently mentions working with coalitions and international partners. The phrase "If they do not act, America will" is the closest to bypassing.
    *   **Salience:** Medium. The urgency is prominent, but the *rejection* of procedure is less explicit than the assertion of swift action.
    *   **Quote:** "We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side. I will not wait on events while dangers gather. I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer."
    *   **Confidence:** Medium. This is a boundary case. The intent is not to *reject* the system, but to act with urgency. However, the *implication* of not waiting on procedures (like international consensus or slow legislative processes) pushes it away from pure procedural legitimacy.

3.  **institutional_respect:**
    *   **Raw Score:** High. The speech emphasizes respect for governmental institutions ("Congress," "military"), expertise (intelligence, scientists), and foundational constitutional principles ("rule of law," "separation of powers," "checks and balances" implied by legislative processes and judicial review, although not explicitly stated). References to "judicial review" or "separation of powers" are absent, but the emphasis on Congress's role and budget processes implies respect for these structures. The "nonnegotiable demands of human dignity" list directly includes "rule of law" and "limits on the power of the state."
    *   **Salience:** High. The theme of respecting institutions is implicitly and explicitly woven throughout the speech, from thanking the military to engaging Congress, and finally listing core constitutional values.
    *   **Quote:** "America will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance."
    *   **Confidence:** High.

4.  **institutional_subversion:**
    *   **Raw Score:** Low. The speech does not contain attacks on the legitimacy of American institutions or experts. It frames foreign adversaries as "corrupt" or "evil" but not domestic institutions.
    *   **Salience:** Low. No rhetorical emphasis on subverting institutions.
    *   **Quote:** "" (No direct quote as there is no evidence of this dimension)
    *   **Confidence:** High (in absence of evidence).

5.  **systemic_continuity:**
    *   **Raw Score:** High. The speech consistently advocates for strengthening and improving the *existing* American system ("protect our homeland," "revive our economy," "improve public health," "stronger police and fire departments," "stricter border enforcement"). It talks about "reform" (education, Social Security) within the existing framework, not an overhaul. The "new ethic and a new creed" is a cultural shift, not a systemic constitutional one. The goals are "to win this war; to protect our homeland; and to revive our economy" - all within the current governmental structure.
    *   **Salience:** High. The entire domestic agenda laid out focuses on improving existing systems and processes, and adapting them to new threats and challenges.
    *   **Quote:** "My budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we will protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy." (This encapsulates the focus on maintaining and improving the current system.)
    *   **Confidence:** High.

6.  **systemic_replacement:**
    *   **Raw Score:** Low. There is no rhetoric advocating for a fundamental change or replacement of the constitutional framework. The focus is entirely on strengthening and utilizing the current system to address challenges.
    *   **Salience:** Low. No rhetorical emphasis on this.
    *   **Quote:** "" (No direct quote as there is no evidence of this dimension)
    *   **Confidence:** High (in absence of evidence).

**Cross-check disambiguation rules:**
*   `procedural_legitimacy` vs `procedural_rejection`: The "not wait" argument for `procedural_rejection` is acknowledged, but it's framed as an urgent *action* within the executive power, not a call to *overthrow* or disregard established *laws*. The overall emphasis is still heavily on legislative process (budget, Congress acting), working with allies, and justice. So, `procedural_legitimacy` is high, `procedural_rejection` is low-medium due to urgency rhetoric.
*   `institutional_respect` vs `institutional_subversion`: Clear distinction. No subversion rhetoric. Strong respect.
*   `systemic_continuity` vs `systemic_replacement`: Clear distinction. The speech is all about making the existing system work better, not replacing it. Reform is consistently framed as improvement within the current system (e.g., "education reform," "Social Security stability").
