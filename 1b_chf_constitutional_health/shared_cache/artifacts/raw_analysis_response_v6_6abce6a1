    "analysis_notes": "The document is a State of the Union address, a genre characterized by formal respect for institutions and calls for legislative action within existing frameworks. The analysis reflects the speech's strong emphasis on bipartisan cooperation, reform of existing systems (continuity), and respect for institutional processes and authority. Pathological dimensions like rejection, subversion, and replacement are either absent or present only as reform-oriented critiques rather than delegitimizing attacks, resulting in low or zero scores for those dimensions."
