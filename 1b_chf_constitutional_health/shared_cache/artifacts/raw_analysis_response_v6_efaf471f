    "analysis_notes": "The document is a classic State of the Union address that strongly aligns with the 'health' dimensions of the framework. It consistently advocates for working within established governmental procedures and institutions to achieve gradual, forward-looking reforms. The rhetoric is centered on bipartisan partnership and leveraging the existing system to prepare for the future. The 'pathology' dimensions (Rejection, Subversion, Replacement) are almost entirely absent from the text, making the scoring straightforward."
