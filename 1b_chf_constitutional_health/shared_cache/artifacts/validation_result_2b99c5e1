    "The corpus manifest entry for document_id 'obama_2009_sotu' has a severe mismatch. The filename is 'Bush_SOTU_2009.txt' while the speaker is listed as 'Barack Obama'. This points a critical data point for the Obama administration to an incorrect source file, corrupting the time series.",
    "The experiment specification exclusively mentions analyzing 'SOTU addresses'. However, to achieve the per-administration counts and a contiguous time series, the analysis must include 'Joint Session Addresses' delivered by presidents in their first year. This is a standard practice, but the experiment document fails to state it explicitly.",
    "The experiment's Abstract states the analysis uses '37+ SOTU addresses'. The Methodology section details a set of speeches that sums to 32 (8+8+8+4+4). The actual number of SOTU-equivalent speeches in the specified 1993-2024 range is 32. The '37+' figure in the abstract is inaccurate.",
    "The framework's machine-readable appendix contains 'framework_version: \"1.0.0\"', which is inconsistent with the file's name ('chf_v10.md') and the human-readable title ('Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0'). The critical 'spec_version' is correct, so this doesn't block execution.",
    "The experiment's scope is defined as 1993-2024. The provided Corpus Manifest has a date_range of '1992-2025' and includes documents from both 1992 and 2025, which are outside the experiment's stated time frame."
