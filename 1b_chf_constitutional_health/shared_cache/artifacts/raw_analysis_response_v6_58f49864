The document presents a clear dichotomy between domestic policy, which is heavily focused on reforming existing institutions (Systemic Continuity), and foreign policy, which is framed around the global spread of democracy. Evidence for Institutional Subversion is present but targeted, contrasting with broader themes of Procedural Legitimacy and Institutional Respect."
