    "analysis_notes": "The document is a formal State of the Union address, a genre well-suited for this framework. The analysis captured the inherent tensions in presidential rhetoric, particularly the dual strategy of calling for bipartisan cooperation within existing procedures while simultaneously criticizing institutional actors (like the Supreme Court) and threatening executive action to bypass legislative gridlock. The primary theme is systemic continuity through a wide range of proposed reforms, giving that dimension the highest salience and intensity."
