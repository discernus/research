The primary themes are Systemic Continuity and Procedural Legitimacy, urging Congress to act through legislative processes. A notable, but secondary, element of Procedural Rejection is present in the conditional threat of executive action on climate change. Anti-institutional and systemic replacement rhetoric is absent."
