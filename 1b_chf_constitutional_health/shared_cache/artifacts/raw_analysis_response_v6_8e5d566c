    "analysis_notes": "The document is a State of the Union address by George W. Bush. Although the filename indicates 2009, the content clearly places it as the 2004 address. The analysis reflects the text provided. The speech heavily emphasizes working through established legislative processes (procedural legitimacy) and respecting the role of Congress (institutional respect). There is a notable, but secondary, theme of institutional subversion targeting 'activist judges'. The dominant rhetorical thrust is one of systemic continuity and reform, with no evidence of advocating for systemic replacement."
