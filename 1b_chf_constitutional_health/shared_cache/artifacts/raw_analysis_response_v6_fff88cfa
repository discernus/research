    "analysis_notes": "The document is a 1996 State of the Union address, a formal speech adhering to constitutional norms. The analysis reflects this context, showing high scores for dimensions related to procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity. The opposing 'pathology' dimensions (rejection, subversion, replacement) are almost entirely absent, as the speech's rhetoric is overwhelmingly focused on bipartisan cooperation, working through established legislative channels, and reforming\u2014rather than replacing\u2014existing government systems and programs. The scoring is therefore confident and clearly delineated."
