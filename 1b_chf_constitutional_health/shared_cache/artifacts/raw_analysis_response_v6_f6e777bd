    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on a State of the Union address, a genre characterized by appeals to legislative action and national unity. The text is a strong example of reformist rhetoric, emphasizing working within established constitutional and institutional channels to address policy challenges. Pathological dimensions are largely absent, with critiques framed as problems to be solved collaboratively rather than as delegitimizing attacks on the system itself."
