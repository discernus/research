The State of the Union format inherently structures some of the discourse, particularly regarding 'institutional_respect'. A notable tension exists between high scores for both 'institutional_subversion' (critiquing 'the swamp') and 'systemic_continuity' (defending the Constitution), which is a key feature of the populist rhetoric in the text."
