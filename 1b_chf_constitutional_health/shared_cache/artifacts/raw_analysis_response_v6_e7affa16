    "analysis_notes": "The document, a State of the Union address, is a quintessential example of reformist, centrist political discourse. The analysis reflects a strong emphasis on working within existing constitutional and institutional structures, leading to high scores in legitimacy, respect, and continuity dimensions. Conversely, there is a near-total absence of rhetoric related to procedural rejection, institutional subversion, or systemic replacement, resulting in zero scores for those dimensions. The speaker's primary rhetorical strategy is to call for bipartisan cooperation to solve national problems, reinforcing the legitimacy of the political process."
