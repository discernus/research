The analysis reflects the speech's strong adherence to traditional constitutional norms and its complete lack of rhetoric associated with procedural rejection, institutional subversion, or systemic replacement. Scores for the 'pathology' dimensions are uniformly zero due to the absence of any supporting evidence."
