    "The Document Summary Table in the experiment specification is inconsistent with the corpus manifest. The document counts for the Bush W. and Trump administrations are incorrect, and the table's total sum (49) contradicts its stated total (48) and the manifest's actual total (48). Specifically, the manifest lists 10 documents for Bush W. (not 11) and a different breakdown for Trump's 7 documents than what the table shows.",
    "The primary hypothesis (H\u2080) for the one-way ANOVA includes the Bush H.W. administration, which has only one data point (n=1). A group in an ANOVA must have n>1 to calculate the necessary within-group variance.",
    "The corpus manifest contains documents with misleading filenames that contradict their associated metadata. For example, the file `Bush_SOTU_2009.txt` has 'Barack Obama' as the speaker, and `Trump_SOTU_2025.txt` has 'Joint Session Address' as its `speech_type`.",
    "The experiment abstract describes the corpus as spanning \"through Biden (2021-2025)\", but the corpus manifest contains documents attributed to Donald Trump in the year 2025. This framing is inconsistent with the corpus contents."
