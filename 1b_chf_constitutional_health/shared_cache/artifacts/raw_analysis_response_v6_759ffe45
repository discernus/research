    "analysis_notes": "The analysis reflects a speech heavily focused on legislative proposals and incremental reform within existing constitutional and institutional structures. The primary rhetorical strategy is to call on Congress to act, thus scoring highly on procedural legitimacy and systemic continuity. Negative dimensions like rejection, subversion, and replacement are either absent or present only in very low, nuanced forms, such as criticizing specific policies or political behaviors rather than the institutions or systems themselves."
