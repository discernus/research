    "analysis_notes": "The analysis focuses on the speaker's orientation toward the U.S. constitutional system. The speech's central theme of promoting democracy abroad is interpreted as an extension of the U.S. system's values (Systemic Continuity), not as a call for revolutionary change within the U.S. (Systemic Replacement). The scoring reflects the speech's strong affirmation of constitutional processes, institutions, and historical continuity."
