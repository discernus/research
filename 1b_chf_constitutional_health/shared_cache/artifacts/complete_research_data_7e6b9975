If no direct quote, use \"\".\n        *   Assess `confidence` (0.0-1.0) for both the score and the evidence.\n        *   Determine `context_type` for the quote. (This isn't explicitly defined in the framework, so I will default to \"direct quote\" or similar if a more specific type isn't evident from the prompt). The prompt says \"context_type\": \"[quote context classification]\", which is vague. I will use \"direct quote\" if it's a direct quote, and \"summary\" if it's a summary of the passage. However, the instruction \"For the \"quote_text\" field, you MUST provide a direct quote from the document. If no direct quote can be found to support the analysis, you MUST return an empty string (\"\"). Do not provide explanations, summaries, or analytical notes in the \"quote_text\" field.\" means `context_type` will likely always be \"direct quote\" or similar. I'll use \"direct quote\" if I find one, and then `quote_text` will be `\"\"` if not, so `context_type` will only be relevant if a quote is found.\n\n4.  **Construct JSON Output:** Assemble all the scores, salience, confidence, and evidence into the specified JSON structure.\n\n**Framework Details (from decoded content):**\n\n*   **Framework Name:** \"constitutional_health_framework\"\n*   **Framework Version:** \"1.0.0\"\n*   **Dimensions:**\n    *   `procedural_legitimacy`: Support for established procedures, respect for constitutional processes, adherence to democratic norms.\n    *   `procedural_rejection`: Rejecting established procedures, extra-constitutional action, emergency power claims, process bypassing.\n    *   `institutional_respect`: Recognition of institutional authority, expertise, legitimate governance role, support for checks and balances.\n    *   `institutional_subversion`: Attacking institutional authority, expertise, delegitimizing democratic institutions.\n    *   `systemic_continuity`: Support for maintaining/improving existing constitutional framework, gradual reform.\n    *   `systemic_replacement`: Advocating fundamental replacement rather than reform, revolutionary change rhetoric.\n\n**Disambiguation Rules:**\n*   **Procedural Axis:**\n    *   `procedural_legitimacy` vs. `procedural_rejection`: If primary function is supporting established processes, score Legitimacy. If bypassing or circumventing, score Rejection.\n    *   `Boundary Cases`: \"Reform the process\" -> Legitimacy vs. Circumvention (Rejection). \"Emergency action needed\" -> Crisis response (Legitimacy) vs. Constitutional bypass (Rejection).\n*   **Institutional Axis:**\n    *   `institutional_respect` vs. `institutional_subversion`: Respect recognizes legitimate authority/expertise. Subversion attacks/delegitimizes.\n    *   `Boundary Cases`: \"Institutional reform needed\" -> constructive criticism (Respect) vs. delegitimizing attack (Subversion). \"Corrupt establishment\" -> legitimate concern vs. institutional delegitimization.\n*   **Systemic Axis:**\n    *   `systemic_continuity` vs. `systemic_replacement`: Continuity supports gradual reform within framework. Replacement advocates fundamental, revolutionary change.\n    *   `Boundary Cases`: \"Major constitutional reform\" -> improvement (Continuity) vs. system replacement (Replacement). \"New system needed\" -> reform rhetoric vs. revolutionary replacement.\n\n**Salience Assessment:**\n*   Frequency and repetition\n*   Structural positioning (opening, closing, thesis)\n*   Thematic centrality\n*   Rhetorical devices\n\n**Document: Bush_SOTU_2003.txt**\n\nI'll read through the document with these dimensions in mind.\n\n**Initial Scan for Themes:**\n\n*   **Unity/Bipartisanship:** \"system of two parties... differences and debate... conducted in a civil tone... respect for one another.\" -> `procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`\n*   **Fight against terrorism/Iraq war:** \"act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom\", \"end of tyranny\", \"future security of America depends on it\", \"dictatorships shelter terrorists\", \"fight against terror\", \"Iraq\", \"Afghan\", \"North Korea, Iran\", \"Saddam Hussein\", \"weapons of mass murder\". -> This is a core theme, but how does it relate to constitutional health? It frames national security as linked to spreading democracy, which might touch on systemic continuity/replacement by *others*, and institutional respect for US institutions that lead this.\n*   **Economic policies:** \"build our prosperity by leading the world economy\", \"economic retreat leads to a stagnant and second-rate economy\". Tax cuts, spending cuts, earmark reform, entitlements (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid). -> Focus on economic policy, less on constitutional processes, institutions, or systemic change within the US constitutional framework itself.\n*   **Social issues/Values:** \"compassionate, decent, hopeful society\", \"violent crime rates have fallen\", \"welfare cases have dropped\", \"drug use among youth is down\", \"fewer abortions\", \"rising generation finding personal responsibility\", \"wise policies\", \"culture is unraveling\", \"unethical conduct by public officials\", \"courts that try to redefine marriage\". \"human cloning\", \"embryos for experiments\", \"human-animal hybrids\", \"selling human embryos\". \"gift from our Creator\". -> These touch on values and societal health, not directly constitutional health. \"courts that try to redefine marriage\" might hint at `institutional_subversion` if framed as undermining judicial role or proper process, but it's more about judicial *outcomes* than process or legitimacy.\n*   **Call for unity/cooperation:** \"join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements\", \"put aside partisan politics and work together\". -> `procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`.\n*   **Specific actions for national security:** PATRIOT Act reauthorization, terrorist surveillance program \"authorized by Constitution and by statute\". \"Federal courts have approved the use of that authority\". \"Appropriate Members of Congress have been kept informed\". -> Strong `procedural_legitimacy` and `institutional_respect` here, defending actions as legitimate and within bounds.\n*   **Role of US in the world:** \"continue to lead\", \"protect our people... secure the peace... control our destiny... by our leadership\", \"end of tyranny in our world\". \"advance of freedom is the great story of our time\". \"democracies replace resentment with hope\". \"America rejects the false comfort of isolationism.\" -> This frames US global action within a broader historical and moral context. It relates more to US foreign policy doctrine than internal constitutional health.\n*   **Iraq progress:** \"from dictatorship to liberation, to sovereignty, to a Constitution, to national elections.\" -> This is about building a *new* constitutional system elsewhere, not impacting the US one directly.\n*   **Iraq decision-making:** \"decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, DC.\" -> This is more about operational control than constitutional principles.\n*   **Criticism:** \"responsible criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure.\" -> This distinguishes legitimate critique from destructive one. Supports `institutional_respect` and rejects `institutional_subversion` implicitly.\n\n**Scoring Strategy:**\n\n*   **procedural_legitimacy:** Strong. Emphasis on working within existing processes (Congress, Courts), respect for debate, call for bipartisanship, justification of surveillance based on constitutional/statutory authority.\n*   **procedural_rejection:** Very low. No explicit calls to bypass or reject processes. The closest might be the surveillance program, but it's framed as *authorized* by existing law and constitution.\n*   **institutional_respect:** Strong. Deference to Congress (\"seek your good advice\"), Supreme Court (new members, O'Connor), law enforcement/military, justification for actions based on \"institutional authority.\" Explicitly distinguishes responsible criticism from delegitimizing defeatism.\n*   **institutional_subversion:** Very low. No calls to undermine US institutions. Criticisms are of other nations' institutions or vague \"activist courts\" but not framed as a general attack on US democratic institutions.\n*   **systemic_continuity:** Moderate to Strong. Emphasis on \"strengthening our economic leadership\", \"continuing to lead the world in human talent and creativity\", \"preparing our Nation to compete in the world\". Suggests improvement and strengthening *within* the existing system. Economic agenda is about improving the current system, not replacing it. Health care, energy, education reforms are all framed as improvements within the existing framework.\n*   **systemic_replacement:** Very low. No language suggesting a fundamental overhaul or revolutionary change to the US constitutional system. The focus on \"new system\" is external (Iraq).\n\n**Refining Scores and Salience:**\n\n**Procedural Legitimacy:**\n*   Mentions working with Congress, respect for debate, \"civil tone,\" \"good will and respect for one another.\"\n*   Justifies surveillance program as \"based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute\" and \"Federal courts have approved the use of that authority.\"\n*   Call for commission to address entitlements (\"put aside partisan politics and work together\").\n*   Reauthorization of PATRIOT Act.\n*   Overall, consistent emphasis on working within the established system.\n*   *Score:* 0.8 (high intensity, frequent mentions, central to political discourse)\n*   *Salience:* 0.7 (discussed in various sections, particularly concerning national security actions and domestic policy)\n\n**Procedural Rejection:**\n*   No explicit advocacy for bypassing or rejecting procedures. The closest, the surveillance program, is framed as *legal* and *constitutional*.\n*   *Score:* 0.0 (absent)\n*   *Salience:* 0.0 (not prominent)\n\n**Institutional Respect:**\n*   Expresses gratitude to Supreme Court members, the Senate for confirmations.\n*   Highlights role of law enforcement, intelligence, military (\"superb professionals\").\n*   States that military decisions are made by commanders, not politicians.\n*   Distinguishes between \"responsible criticism\" and \"defeatism.\"\n*   Recognizes institutional obligations (\"Our Government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly\").\n*   Call for reforms to strengthen \"ethical standards of Washington\" - implies respect for the institution itself, seeking to improve its integrity.\n*   *Score:* 0.8 (high recognition and support for various government branches and their roles)\n*   *Salience:* 0.7 (recurs throughout, particularly in national security and domestic sections)\n\n**Institutional Subversion:**\n*   No direct attacks on US institutional authority.\n*   Criticism of \"activist courts that try to redefine marriage\" is present, but framed as a policy disagreement or a belief in judicial overreach, not a wholesale delegitimization of the judiciary itself. It's about outcomes vs. process.\n*   The framework's definition for `institutional_subversion` (\"attacking institutional authority, expertise, or legitimate governance role, delegitimizing democratic institutions\") is not met by this particular criticism. It's a critique of specific *judicial actions* not a general delegitimization of the court's role or authority.\n*   *Score:* 0.1 (very weak, indirect hint from the 'activist courts' comment, but not a central theme)\n*   *Salience:* 0.1 (minimal rhetorical prominence for this specific type of critique, it's a brief mention)\n\n**Systemic Continuity:**\n*   Emphasis on \"strengthening our economic leadership,\" \"improving our environment,\" \"make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past.\"\n*   Advocates for \"gradual reform\" in social security/medicare through a commission, not immediate drastic change.\n*   Mentions \"No Child Left Behind Act\" for educational improvement.\n*   \"We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land.\"\n*   Overall theme is improvement and strengthening the existing US system.\n*   *Score:* 0.9 (very strong, dominant theme of progress and reform within the existing framework)\n*   *Salience:* 0.8 (pervasive, forms the basis for numerous policy proposals and positive outlooks)\n\n**Systemic Replacement:**\n*   No language advocating for a fundamental replacement of the US constitutional system.\n*   The \"new system\" rhetoric applies to Iraq, not the US.\n*   *Score:* 0.0 (absent)\n*   *Salience:* 0.0 (not prominent)\n\nConfidence: Overall high confidence in the analysis. The speech is quite direct and the themes are clear.\n\nFinal check on JSON structure and constraints.\n- All 6 dimensions scored.\n- Raw scores 0.0-1.0.\n- Salience 0.0-1.0.\n- Confidence 0.0-1.0.\n- Evidence provided with `quote_text`, `confidence`, and `context_type`. If no quote, `quote_text` is empty string.\n- No mathematical calculations.\n- `document_id` and `document_name` placeholders are used correctly.\n- `analyst_confidence` is overall.\n- `analysis_notes` for methodological notes.\n- Verify dimension names match exactly.\n\nLooks good.<ctrl95><<<DISCERNUS_ANALYSIS_JSON_v6>>>\n{\n  \"analysis_metadata\": {\n    \"framework_name\": \"constitutional_health_framework\",\n    \"framework_version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"analyst_confidence\": 0.9,\n    \"analysis_notes\": \"Analysis focused on identifying the speaker's rhetorical emphasis on constitutional and institutional principles.

It focuses heavily on the \"war on terror,\" homeland security, and economic policies.\n\n**Initial Pass - Identifying themes and potential dimensions:**\n\n*   **War on Terror, Afghanistan, Iraq:**\n    *   \"America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror.\" -> Implies established alliances, working within international frameworks (could lean towards `institutional_respect` for international bodies or `procedural_legitimacy` for international cooperation).\n    *   \"When I called our troops into action, I did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill.\" -> Reinforces executive authority, command structure.\n    *   \"our cause is just, and it continues.\"\n    *   \"shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice.\" -> Focus on justice, established legal processes.\n    *   \"prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world.\" -> Prevention, security.\n    *   \"States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.\" -> Strong rhetoric, framing adversaries outside the legitimate system. This could lean towards `procedural_rejection` (acting outside normal diplomatic channels due to threat) or `institutional_subversion` (describing regimes as illegitimate).\n    *   \"We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction.\" -> Collaboration, established international efforts.\n    *   \"We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side. I will not wait on events while dangers gather.\" -> This is a strong indicator of `procedural_rejection` \u2013 bypassing traditional deliberation due to perceived urgency/danger.\n    *   \"History has called America and our allies to action, and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight.\" -> Justification for action, sense of historical duty.\n    *   \"Our first priority must always be the security of our Nation...\" -> Core governmental responsibility.\n\n*   **Homeland Security:**\n    *  \"protect our citizens and strengthen our Nation against the ongoing threat of another attack.\" -> Focus on governmental duty.\n    *   \"My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and border security, and improved intelligence.\" -> Systematic, structured approach.\n    *   \"We will develop vaccines... train and equip our heroic police and firefighters... improve intelligence collection and sharing... expand patrols at our borders... strengthen the security of air travel...\" -> Focus on enhancing existing systems. `Systemic_continuity`.\n\n*   **Economy & Domestic Policy (Education, Healthcare, Retirement):**\n    *   \"economic security for the American people.\" -> Focus on prosperity within the existing system.\n    *   \"fiscal responsibility.\"\n    *   \"extend unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage.\" -> Government action within its established role.\n    *   \"Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind.\" -> Emphasizes bipartisan cooperation and reform within the existing system. `procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`.\n    *   \"My budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we will protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy.\" -> Clear governmental objectives within its established role.\n    *   \"This Congress must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on foreign oil.\" -> Call for legislative action within the established system. `procedural_legitimacy`.\n    *   \"Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling the child credit, and ending the death tax. For the sake of long-term growth and to help Americans plan for the future, let's make these tax cuts permanent.\" -> Democratic process (Congress listening) and policy decisions. `procedural_legitimacy`.\n    *   \"We must make Social Security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them.\" -> Reform within the existing system. `systemic_continuity`.\n\n*   **Values & Character:**\n    *   \"Our enemies believed America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and selfishness. They were as wrong as they are evil.\" -> Reaffirmation of American strength and values.\n    *   \"We were reminded that we are citizens with obligations to each other, to our country, and to history.\" -> Civic duty, shared responsibility.\n    *   \"America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed, 'Let's roll.'\" -> Shift in national character, but not a change to the constitutional system itself.\n    *   \"We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self.\" -> Altruism.\n    *   \"My call tonight is for every American to commit at least 2 years, 4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime, to the service of your neighbors and your Nation.\" -> Call to civic action, again not about the constitutional system.\n    *   \"America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere.\" -> Universal values, leadership role.\n    *   \"We have no intention of imposing our culture. But America will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance.\" -> These are foundational constitutional principles. This is a strong indicator of `institutional_respect` (limits on power, rule of law) and `systemic_continuity` (unchanging principles).\n\n**Scoring each dimension:**\n\n1.  **procedural_legitimacy:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** High. The speech constantly refers to established processes (Congress, legislative process, budget, elections, working with allies). \"Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform,\" \"Congress listened to the people and responded,\" \"My budget supports three great goals for America.\" The emphasis is on legitimate actions within the existing framework.\n    *   **Salience:** High. The theme of working within the system, Congress's role, and established processes is threaded throughout the domestic policy sections and even indirectly in the foreign policy sections (coalition, justice).\n    *   **Quote:** \"Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** High.\n\n2.  **procedural_rejection:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** Low to Medium. While there's a strong emphasis on decisive action and not waiting (\"I will not wait on events while dangers gather\"), this is framed as necessary action to protect the nation, not as a rejection of the *procedures* themselves, but rather an urgency that might *bypass* some typical deliberative pace. However, it's not advocating for explicitly *extra-constitutional action* or *circumvention* of laws, but rather decisive executive action within a broad interpretation of executive power. The \"axis of evil\" rhetoric could imply a justification for acting outside traditional diplomatic norms, but the speech consistently mentions working with coalitions and international partners. The phrase \"If they do not act, America will\" is the closest to bypassing.\n    *   **Salience:** Medium. The urgency is prominent, but the *rejection* of procedure is less explicit than the assertion of swift action.\n    *   **Quote:** \"We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side. I will not wait on events while dangers gather. I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** Medium. This is a boundary case. The intent is not to *reject* the system, but to act with urgency. However, the *implication* of not waiting on procedures (like international consensus or slow legislative processes) pushes it away from pure procedural legitimacy.\n\n3.  **institutional_respect:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** High. The speech emphasizes respect for governmental institutions (\"Congress,\" \"military\"), expertise (intelligence, scientists), and foundational constitutional principles (\"rule of law,\" \"separation of powers,\" \"checks and balances\" implied by legislative processes and judicial review, although not explicitly stated). References to \"judicial review\" or \"separation of powers\" are absent, but the emphasis on Congress's role and budget processes implies respect for these structures. The \"nonnegotiable demands of human dignity\" list directly includes \"rule of law\" and \"limits on the power of the state.\"\n    *   **Salience:** High. The theme of respecting institutions is implicitly and explicitly woven throughout the speech, from thanking the military to engaging Congress, and finally listing core constitutional values.\n    *   **Quote:** \"America will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** High.\n\n4.  **institutional_subversion:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** Low. The speech does not contain attacks on the legitimacy of American institutions or experts. It frames foreign adversaries as \"corrupt\" or \"evil\" but not domestic institutions.\n    *   **Salience:** Low. No rhetorical emphasis on subverting institutions.\n    *   **Quote:** \"\" (No direct quote as there is no evidence of this dimension)\n    *   **Confidence:** High (in absence of evidence).\n\n5.  **systemic_continuity:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** High. The speech consistently advocates for strengthening and improving the *existing* American system (\"protect our homeland,\" \"revive our economy,\" \"improve public health,\" \"stronger police and fire departments,\" \"stricter border enforcement\"). It talks about \"reform\" (education, Social Security) within the existing framework, not an overhaul. The \"new ethic and a new creed\" is a cultural shift, not a systemic constitutional one. The goals are \"to win this war; to protect our homeland; and to revive our economy\" - all within the current governmental structure.\n    *   **Salience:** High. The entire domestic agenda laid out focuses on improving existing systems and processes, and adapting them to new threats and challenges.\n    *   **Quote:** \"My budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we will protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy.\" (This encapsulates the focus on maintaining and improving the current system.)\n    *   **Confidence:** High.\n\n6.  **systemic_replacement:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** Low. There is no rhetoric advocating for a fundamental change or replacement of the constitutional framework. The focus is entirely on strengthening and utilizing the current system to address challenges.\n    *   **Salience:** Low. No rhetorical emphasis on this.\n    *   **Quote:** \"\" (No direct quote as there is no evidence of this dimension)\n    *   **Confidence:** High (in absence of evidence).\n\n**Cross-check disambiguation rules:**\n*   `procedural_legitimacy` vs `procedural_rejection`: The \"not wait\" argument for `procedural_rejection` is acknowledged, but it's framed as an urgent *action* within the executive power, not a call to *overthrow* or disregard established *laws*. The overall emphasis is still heavily on legislative process (budget, Congress acting), working with allies, and justice. So, `procedural_legitimacy` is high, `procedural_rejection` is low-medium due to urgency rhetoric.\n*   `institutional_respect` vs `institutional_subversion`: Clear distinction. No subversion rhetoric. Strong respect.\n*   `systemic_continuity` vs `systemic_replacement`: Clear distinction. The speech is all about making the existing system work better, not replacing it. Reform is consistently framed as improvement within the current system (e.g., \"education reform,\" \"Social Security stability\").\n\nFinal confidence check: The analysis seems consistent with the framework and the document's content.<ctrl95><<<DISCERNUS_ANALYSIS_JSON_v6>>>\n{\n  \"analysis_metadata\": {\n    \"framework_name\": \"constitutional_health_framework\",\n    \"framework_version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"analyst_confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"analysis_notes\": \"Analyzed a State of the Union address, focusing on the President's emphasis on established procedures, institutional authority, and systemic continuity in the face of domestic and international challenges.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"Bush_SOTU_2007.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"procedural_legitimacy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.85,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"procedural_rejection\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.4,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"institutional_respect\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"institutional_subversion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"systemic_continuity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"systemic_replacement\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"procedural_legitimacy\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"direct statement of collaborative legislative process\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"procedural_rejection\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side.

If no direct quote, use \"\".\n        *   Assess `confidence` (0.0-1.0) for both the score and the evidence.\n        *   Determine `context_type` for the quote. (This isn't explicitly defined in the framework, so I will default to \"direct quote\" or similar if a more specific type isn't evident from the prompt). The prompt says \"context_type\": \"[quote context classification]\", which is vague. I will use \"direct quote\" if it's a direct quote, and \"summary\" if it's a summary of the passage. However, the instruction \"For the \"quote_text\" field, you MUST provide a direct quote from the document. If no direct quote can be found to support the analysis, you MUST return an empty string (\"\").

If bypassing or circumventing, score Rejection.\n    *   `Boundary Cases`: \"Reform the process\" -> Legitimacy vs. Circumvention (Rejection). \"Emergency action needed\" -> Crisis response (Legitimacy) vs. Constitutional bypass (Rejection).\n*   **Institutional Axis:**\n    *   `institutional_respect` vs. `institutional_subversion`: Respect recognizes legitimate authority/expertise. Subversion attacks/delegitimizes.\n    *   `Boundary Cases`: \"Institutional reform needed\" -> constructive criticism (Respect) vs. delegitimizing attack (Subversion). \"Corrupt establishment\" -> legitimate concern vs. institutional delegitimization.\n*   **Systemic Axis:**\n    *   `systemic_continuity` vs. `systemic_replacement`: Continuity supports gradual reform within framework. Replacement advocates fundamental, revolutionary change.\n    *   `Boundary Cases`: \"Major constitutional reform\" -> improvement (Continuity) vs. system replacement (Replacement). \"New system needed\" -> reform rhetoric vs. revolutionary replacement.\n\n**Salience Assessment:**\n*   Frequency and repetition\n*   Structural positioning (opening, closing, thesis)\n*   Thematic centrality\n*   Rhetorical devices\n\n**Document: Bush_SOTU_2003.txt**\n\nI'll read through the document with these dimensions in mind.\n\n**Initial Scan for Themes:**\n\n*   **Unity/Bipartisanship:** \"system of two parties... differences and debate... conducted in a civil tone... respect for one another.\" -> `procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`\n*   **Fight against terrorism/Iraq war:** \"act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom\", \"end of tyranny\", \"future security of America depends on it\", \"dictatorships shelter terrorists\", \"fight against terror\", \"Iraq\", \"Afghan\", \"North Korea, Iran\", \"Saddam Hussein\", \"weapons of mass murder\". -> This is a core theme, but how does it relate to constitutional health? It frames national security as linked to spreading democracy, which might touch on systemic continuity/replacement by *others*, and institutional respect for US institutions that lead this.\n*   **Economic policies:** \"build our prosperity by leading the world economy\", \"economic retreat leads to a stagnant and second-rate economy\". Tax cuts, spending cuts, earmark reform, entitlements (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid). -> Focus on economic policy, less on constitutional processes, institutions, or systemic change within the US constitutional framework itself.\n*   **Social issues/Values:** \"compassionate, decent, hopeful society\", \"violent crime rates have fallen\", \"welfare cases have dropped\", \"drug use among youth is down\", \"fewer abortions\", \"rising generation finding personal responsibility\", \"wise policies\", \"culture is unraveling\", \"unethical conduct by public officials\", \"courts that try to redefine marriage\". \"human cloning\", \"embryos for experiments\", \"human-animal hybrids\", \"selling human embryos\". \"gift from our Creator\". -> These touch on values and societal health, not directly constitutional health. \"courts that try to redefine marriage\" might hint at `institutional_subversion` if framed as undermining judicial role or proper process, but it's more about judicial *outcomes* than process or legitimacy.\n*   **Call for unity/cooperation:** \"join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements\", \"put aside partisan politics and work together\". -> `procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`.\n*   **Specific actions for national security:** PATRIOT Act reauthorization, terrorist surveillance program \"authorized by Constitution and by statute\". \"Federal courts have approved the use of that authority\". \"Appropriate Members of Congress have been kept informed\". -> Strong `procedural_legitimacy` and `institutional_respect` here, defending actions as legitimate and within bounds.\n*   **Role of US in the world:** \"continue to lead\", \"protect our people... secure the peace... control our destiny... by our leadership\", \"end of tyranny in our world\". \"advance of freedom is the great story of our time\". \"democracies replace resentment with hope\". \"America rejects the false comfort of isolationism.\" -> This frames US global action within a broader historical and moral context. It relates more to US foreign policy doctrine than internal constitutional health.\n*   **Iraq progress:** \"from dictatorship to liberation, to sovereignty, to a Constitution, to national elections.\" -> This is about building a *new* constitutional system elsewhere, not impacting the US one directly.\n*   **Iraq decision-making:** \"decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, DC.\" -> This is more about operational control than constitutional principles.\n*   **Criticism:** \"responsible criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure.\" -> This distinguishes legitimate critique from destructive one. Supports `institutional_respect` and rejects `institutional_subversion` implicitly.\n\n**Scoring Strategy:**\n\n*   **procedural_legitimacy:** Strong. Emphasis on working within existing processes (Congress, Courts), respect for debate, call for bipartisanship, justification of surveillance based on constitutional/statutory authority.\n*   **procedural_rejection:** Very low. No explicit calls to bypass or reject processes. The closest might be the surveillance program, but it's framed as *authorized* by existing law and constitution.\n*   **institutional_respect:** Strong. Deference to Congress (\"seek your good advice\"), Supreme Court (new members, O'Connor), law enforcement/military, justification for actions based on \"institutional authority.\" Explicitly distinguishes responsible criticism from delegitimizing defeatism.\n*   **institutional_subversion:** Very low. No calls to undermine US institutions. Criticisms are of other nations' institutions or vague \"activist courts\" but not framed as a general attack on US democratic institutions.\n*   **systemic_continuity:** Moderate to Strong. Emphasis on \"strengthening our economic leadership\", \"continuing to lead the world in human talent and creativity\", \"preparing our Nation to compete in the world\". Suggests improvement and strengthening *within* the existing system. Economic agenda is about improving the current system, not replacing it. Health care, energy, education reforms are all framed as improvements within the existing framework.\n*   **systemic_replacement:** Very low. No language suggesting a fundamental overhaul or revolutionary change to the US constitutional system. The focus on \"new system\" is external (Iraq).\n\n**Refining Scores and Salience:**\n\n**Procedural Legitimacy:**\n*   Mentions working with Congress, respect for debate, \"civil tone,\" \"good will and respect for one another.\"\n*   Justifies surveillance program as \"based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute\" and \"Federal courts have approved the use of that authority.\"\n*   Call for commission to address entitlements (\"put aside partisan politics and work together\").\n*   Reauthorization of PATRIOT Act.\n*   Overall, consistent emphasis on working within the established system.\n*   *Score:* 0.8 (high intensity, frequent mentions, central to political discourse)\n*   *Salience:* 0.7 (discussed in various sections, particularly concerning national security actions and domestic policy)\n\n**Procedural Rejection:**\n*   No explicit advocacy for bypassing or rejecting procedures. The closest, the surveillance program, is framed as *legal* and *constitutional*.\n*   *Score:* 0.0 (absent)\n*   *Salience:* 0.0 (not prominent)\n\n**Institutional Respect:**\n*   Expresses gratitude to Supreme Court members, the Senate for confirmations.\n*   Highlights role of law enforcement, intelligence, military (\"superb professionals\").\n*   States that military decisions are made by commanders, not politicians.\n*   Distinguishes between \"responsible criticism\" and \"defeatism.\"\n*   Recognizes institutional obligations (\"Our Government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly\").\n*   Call for reforms to strengthen \"ethical standards of Washington\" - implies respect for the institution itself, seeking to improve its integrity.\n*   *Score:* 0.8 (high recognition and support for various government branches and their roles)\n*   *Salience:* 0.7 (recurs throughout, particularly in national security and domestic sections)\n\n**Institutional Subversion:**\n*   No direct attacks on US institutional authority.\n*   Criticism of \"activist courts that try to redefine marriage\" is present, but framed as a policy disagreement or a belief in judicial overreach, not a wholesale delegitimization of the judiciary itself. It's about outcomes vs. process.\n*   The framework's definition for `institutional_subversion` (\"attacking institutional authority, expertise, or legitimate governance role, delegitimizing democratic institutions\") is not met by this particular criticism. It's a critique of specific *judicial actions* not a general delegitimization of the court's role or authority.\n*   *Score:* 0.1 (very weak, indirect hint from the 'activist courts' comment, but not a central theme)\n*   *Salience:* 0.1 (minimal rhetorical prominence for this specific type of critique, it's a brief mention)\n\n**Systemic Continuity:**\n*   Emphasis on \"strengthening our economic leadership,\" \"improving our environment,\" \"make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past.\"\n*   Advocates for \"gradual reform\" in social security/medicare through a commission, not immediate drastic change.\n*   Mentions \"No Child Left Behind Act\" for educational improvement.\n*   \"We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land.\"\n*   Overall theme is improvement and strengthening the existing US system.\n*   *Score:* 0.9 (very strong, dominant theme of progress and reform within the existing framework)\n*   *Salience:* 0.8 (pervasive, forms the basis for numerous policy proposals and positive outlooks)\n\n**Systemic Replacement:**\n*   No language advocating for a fundamental replacement of the US constitutional system.\n*   The \"new system\" rhetoric applies to Iraq, not the US.\n*   *Score:* 0.0 (absent)\n*   *Salience:* 0.0 (not prominent)\n\nConfidence: Overall high confidence in the analysis. The speech is quite direct and the themes are clear.\n\nFinal check on JSON structure and constraints.\n- All 6 dimensions scored.\n- Raw scores 0.0-1.0.\n- Salience 0.0-1.0.\n- Confidence 0.0-1.0.\n- Evidence provided with `quote_text`, `confidence`, and `context_type`.

It focuses heavily on the \"war on terror,\" homeland security, and economic policies.\n\n**Initial Pass - Identifying themes and potential dimensions:**\n\n*   **War on Terror, Afghanistan, Iraq:**\n    *   \"America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror.\" -> Implies established alliances, working within international frameworks (could lean towards `institutional_respect` for international bodies or `procedural_legitimacy` for international cooperation).\n    *   \"When I called our troops into action, I did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill.\" -> Reinforces executive authority, command structure.\n    *   \"our cause is just, and it continues.\"\n    *   \"shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice.\" -> Focus on justice, established legal processes.\n    *   \"prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world.\" -> Prevention, security.\n    *   \"States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.\" -> Strong rhetoric, framing adversaries outside the legitimate system. This could lean towards `procedural_rejection` (acting outside normal diplomatic channels due to threat) or `institutional_subversion` (describing regimes as illegitimate).\n    *   \"We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction.\" -> Collaboration, established international efforts.\n    *   \"We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side. I will not wait on events while dangers gather.\" -> This is a strong indicator of `procedural_rejection` \u2013 bypassing traditional deliberation due to perceived urgency/danger.\n    *   \"History has called America and our allies to action, and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight.\" -> Justification for action, sense of historical duty.\n    *   \"Our first priority must always be the security of our Nation...\" -> Core governmental responsibility.\n\n*   **Homeland Security:**\n    *  \"protect our citizens and strengthen our Nation against the ongoing threat of another attack.\" -> Focus on governmental duty.\n    *   \"My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and border security, and improved intelligence.\" -> Systematic, structured approach.\n    *   \"We will develop vaccines... train and equip our heroic police and firefighters... improve intelligence collection and sharing... expand patrols at our borders... strengthen the security of air travel...\" -> Focus on enhancing existing systems. `Systemic_continuity`.\n\n*   **Economy & Domestic Policy (Education, Healthcare, Retirement):**\n    *   \"economic security for the American people.\" -> Focus on prosperity within the existing system.\n    *   \"fiscal responsibility.\"\n    *   \"extend unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage.\" -> Government action within its established role.\n    *   \"Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind.\" -> Emphasizes bipartisan cooperation and reform within the existing system. `procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`.\n    *   \"My budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we will protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy.\" -> Clear governmental objectives within its established role.\n    *   \"This Congress must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on foreign oil.\" -> Call for legislative action within the established system. `procedural_legitimacy`.\n    *   \"Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling the child credit, and ending the death tax. For the sake of long-term growth and to help Americans plan for the future, let's make these tax cuts permanent.\" -> Democratic process (Congress listening) and policy decisions. `procedural_legitimacy`.\n    *   \"We must make Social Security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them.\" -> Reform within the existing system. `systemic_continuity`.\n\n*   **Values & Character:**\n    *   \"Our enemies believed America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and selfishness. They were as wrong as they are evil.\" -> Reaffirmation of American strength and values.\n    *   \"We were reminded that we are citizens with obligations to each other, to our country, and to history.\" -> Civic duty, shared responsibility.\n    *   \"America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed, 'Let's roll.'\" -> Shift in national character, but not a change to the constitutional system itself.\n    *   \"We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self.\" -> Altruism.\n    *   \"My call tonight is for every American to commit at least 2 years, 4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime, to the service of your neighbors and your Nation.\" -> Call to civic action, again not about the constitutional system.\n    *   \"America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere.\" -> Universal values, leadership role.\n    *   \"We have no intention of imposing our culture. But America will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance.\" -> These are foundational constitutional principles. This is a strong indicator of `institutional_respect` (limits on power, rule of law) and `systemic_continuity` (unchanging principles).\n\n**Scoring each dimension:**\n\n1.  **procedural_legitimacy:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** High. The speech constantly refers to established processes (Congress, legislative process, budget, elections, working with allies). \"Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform,\" \"Congress listened to the people and responded,\" \"My budget supports three great goals for America.\" The emphasis is on legitimate actions within the existing framework.\n    *   **Salience:** High. The theme of working within the system, Congress's role, and established processes is threaded throughout the domestic policy sections and even indirectly in the foreign policy sections (coalition, justice).\n    *   **Quote:** \"Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** High.\n\n2.  **procedural_rejection:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** Low to Medium. While there's a strong emphasis on decisive action and not waiting (\"I will not wait on events while dangers gather\"), this is framed as necessary action to protect the nation, not as a rejection of the *procedures* themselves, but rather an urgency that might *bypass* some typical deliberative pace. However, it's not advocating for explicitly *extra-constitutional action* or *circumvention* of laws, but rather decisive executive action within a broad interpretation of executive power. The \"axis of evil\" rhetoric could imply a justification for acting outside traditional diplomatic norms, but the speech consistently mentions working with coalitions and international partners. The phrase \"If they do not act, America will\" is the closest to bypassing.\n    *   **Salience:** Medium. The urgency is prominent, but the *rejection* of procedure is less explicit than the assertion of swift action.\n    *   **Quote:** \"We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side. I will not wait on events while dangers gather. I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** Medium. This is a boundary case. The intent is not to *reject* the system, but to act with urgency. However, the *implication* of not waiting on procedures (like international consensus or slow legislative processes) pushes it away from pure procedural legitimacy.\n\n3.  **institutional_respect:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** High. The speech emphasizes respect for governmental institutions (\"Congress,\" \"military\"), expertise (intelligence, scientists), and foundational constitutional principles (\"rule of law,\" \"separation of powers,\" \"checks and balances\" implied by legislative processes and judicial review, although not explicitly stated). References to \"judicial review\" or \"separation of powers\" are absent, but the emphasis on Congress's role and budget processes implies respect for these structures. The \"nonnegotiable demands of human dignity\" list directly includes \"rule of law\" and \"limits on the power of the state.\"\n    *   **Salience:** High. The theme of respecting institutions is implicitly and explicitly woven throughout the speech, from thanking the military to engaging Congress, and finally listing core constitutional values.\n    *   **Quote:** \"America will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance.\"\n    *   **Confidence:** High.\n\n4.  **institutional_subversion:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** Low. The speech does not contain attacks on the legitimacy of American institutions or experts. It frames foreign adversaries as \"corrupt\" or \"evil\" but not domestic institutions.\n    *   **Salience:** Low. No rhetorical emphasis on subverting institutions.\n    *   **Quote:** \"\" (No direct quote as there is no evidence of this dimension)\n    *   **Confidence:** High (in absence of evidence).\n\n5.  **systemic_continuity:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** High. The speech consistently advocates for strengthening and improving the *existing* American system (\"protect our homeland,\" \"revive our economy,\" \"improve public health,\" \"stronger police and fire departments,\" \"stricter border enforcement\"). It talks about \"reform\" (education, Social Security) within the existing framework, not an overhaul. The \"new ethic and a new creed\" is a cultural shift, not a systemic constitutional one. The goals are \"to win this war; to protect our homeland; and to revive our economy\" - all within the current governmental structure.\n    *   **Salience:** High. The entire domestic agenda laid out focuses on improving existing systems and processes, and adapting them to new threats and challenges.\n    *   **Quote:** \"My budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we will protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy.\" (This encapsulates the focus on maintaining and improving the current system.)\n    *   **Confidence:** High.\n\n6.  **systemic_replacement:**\n    *   **Raw Score:** Low. There is no rhetoric advocating for a fundamental change or replacement of the constitutional framework. The focus is entirely on strengthening and utilizing the current system to address challenges.\n    *   **Salience:** Low. No rhetorical emphasis on this.\n    *   **Quote:** \"\" (No direct quote as there is no evidence of this dimension)\n    *   **Confidence:** High (in absence of evidence).\n\n**Cross-check disambiguation rules:**\n*   `procedural_legitimacy` vs `procedural_rejection`: The \"not wait\" argument for `procedural_rejection` is acknowledged, but it's framed as an urgent *action* within the executive power, not a call to *overthrow* or disregard established *laws*. The overall emphasis is still heavily on legislative process (budget, Congress acting), working with allies, and justice. So, `procedural_legitimacy` is high, `procedural_rejection` is low-medium due to urgency rhetoric.\n*   `institutional_respect` vs `institutional_subversion`: Clear distinction. No subversion rhetoric. Strong respect.\n*   `systemic_continuity` vs `systemic_replacement`: Clear distinction. The speech is all about making the existing system work better, not replacing it. Reform is consistently framed as improvement within the current system (e.g., \"education reform,\" \"Social Security stability\").\n\nFinal confidence check: The analysis seems consistent with the framework and the document's content.<ctrl95><<<DISCERNUS_ANALYSIS_JSON_v6>>>\n{\n  \"analysis_metadata\": {\n    \"framework_name\": \"constitutional_health_framework\",\n    \"framework_version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"analyst_confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"analysis_notes\": \"Analyzed a State of the Union address, focusing on the President's emphasis on established procedures, institutional authority, and systemic continuity in the face of domestic and international challenges.\"\n  },\n  \"document_analyses\": [\n    {\n      \"document_id\": \"{artifact_id}\",\n      \"document_name\": \"Bush_SOTU_2007.txt\",\n      \"dimensional_scores\": {\n        \"procedural_legitimacy\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.85,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"procedural_rejection\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.4,\n          \"salience\": 0.5,\n          \"confidence\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"institutional_respect\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"institutional_subversion\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"systemic_continuity\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 0.9,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        },\n        \"systemic_replacement\": {\n          \"raw_score\": 0.0,\n          \"salience\": 0.0,\n          \"confidence\": 0.95\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"procedural_legitimacy\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind.\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.95,\n          \"context_type\": \"direct statement of collaborative legislative process\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"procedural_rejection\",\n          \"quote_text\": \"We'll be deliberate; yet, time is not on our side.
