The discourse is overwhelmingly characterized by calls for bipartisan cooperation, working through established legislative processes, and strengthening existing governmental systems (Social Security, Medicare) for the future. Consequently, dimensions related to constitutional health (legitimacy, respect, continuity) are high, while those related to pathology (rejection, subversion, replacement) are absent."
