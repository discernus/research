    "The experiment's 'Document Summary Table' and 'Statistical Grouping Structure' both state n=11 for the 'Bush W.' administration. However, the corpus manifest ('corpus.md') only contains n=10 documents where the metadata field 'administration' is 'Bush W.'.",
    "The experiment's 'Document Summary Table' specifies incorrect speech type counts for the 'Trump' administration, listing 4 SOTU and 1 Joint Session. The corpus manifest metadata shows this group actually contains 3 SOTU and 2 Joint Session addresses.",
    "The experiment's 'Document Summary Table' contains an internal arithmetic error. The individual administration counts as listed (1 + 12 + 11 + 12 + 7 + 6) sum to 49, but the table's 'Total' is stated as 48, which matches the corpus manifest.",
    "The prose description in `corpus.md` refers to a 'Washington (1789): First Inaugural' document. This document is not listed in the machine-readable YAML manifest and is therefore not part of the executable corpus.",
    "Several documents in the corpus manifest have misleading filenames or identifiers that conflict with their authoritative metadata. For example, `Bush_SOTU_2009.txt` is assigned to the 'Obama' administration, and the file `Trump_SOTU_2025.txt` has a `document_id` of `trump_2025_joint_session` and `speech_type` of 'Joint Session Address'.",
    "The group sizes for the 'Trump' (n=7) and 'Biden' (n=6) administrations are small. This reduces the statistical power of the planned ANOVA and subsequent pairwise comparisons (Tukey HSD) and variance tests (Levene's test).",
    "The framework file is named `chf_v10.md` and correctly uses `spec_version: \"10.0\"`, but its internal metadata specifies `framework_version: \"1.0.0\"`."
