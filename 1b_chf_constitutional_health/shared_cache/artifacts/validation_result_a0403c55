    "The corpus manifest ('corpus.md') is specified as `corpus_version`: \"7.3\" and uses a JSON format. The experiment specification requires a v8.0.1 compliant corpus manifest, which must be a Markdown file with a human-readable overview and a YAML appendix. The provided v7.3 format is deprecated and incompatible.",
    "The experiment is explicitly scoped to analyzing \"State of the Union rhetoric\" only. However, the corpus manifest includes a large number of documents with other 'speech_type' values, such as \"Inaugural\", \"Joint Session Address\", and \"Farewell Address\".",
    "The 'president' metadata field, a critical variable for the \"Administration Comparison\" analysis, uses inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., \"Bush\", \"George W. Bush\", \"William J. Clinton\").",
    "The corpus manifest contains several internally inconsistent or erroneous records, including SOTU addresses attributed to presidents in years they were not in office (e.g., 'Clinton_SOTU_2001.txt', 'Obama_SOTU_2017.txt') and a document attributed to the wrong president ('Bush_SOTU_2009.txt' attributed to Obama).",
    "The experiment abstract claims to analyze \"37+ SOTU addresses,\" but the provided manifest contains only approximately 28 SOTU addresses within the 1993-2024 period."
