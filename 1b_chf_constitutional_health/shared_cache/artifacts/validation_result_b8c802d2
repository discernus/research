    "The experiment's description of its data composition is inconsistent with the corpus manifest. The 'Document Summary Table' and 'Statistical Grouping Structure' in the experiment spec do not match the document counts and metadata provided in the corpus manifest for the Bush W. and Trump administrations.",
    "The framework's internal metadata does not match its filename and prose description. The file 'chf_v10.md' refers to itself as v10.0, but its machine-readable metadata specifies 'framework_version: \"1.0.0\"'.",
    "The human-readable description in 'corpus.md' lists a document ('Washington (1789): First Inaugural') that is not present in the machine-readable document manifest. Additionally, the year ranges for administrations in the experiment spec's 'Statistical Grouping Structure' (e.g., Clinton 1993-2001) are misleadingly overlapping."
