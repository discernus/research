## 1. Executive Summary

This computational social science analysis evaluates the constitutional health of presidential addresses to Congress from 1992 to 2025, utilizing the Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0. The study analyzed 48 speeches across the administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. The central finding reveals a dramatic and statistically significant divergence in constitutional rhetoric during the Trump administration compared to a stable, high-health baseline maintained by all other modern presidents, regardless of political party.

A one-way ANOVA test on the primary `constitutional_health_index` metric yielded a highly significant result (F(5, 41) = 16.37, p < .001), indicating substantial differences between administrations. The effect size was exceptionally large (η² = 0.66), suggesting that the presidential administration accounts for approximately 66% of the variance in constitutional health scores. Post-hoc Tukey HSD tests confirmed that the Trump administration's mean health score (M = -0.21) was significantly lower than that of every other administration analyzed (p < .001 for all pairwise comparisons), while no significant differences were found among the Clinton, Bush W., Obama, and Biden administrations. This pattern points not to a gradual erosion of constitutional rhetoric, but to a sharp, anomalous break from established norms.

The analysis further reveals that this divergence is driven by high levels of `institutional_subversion` and `procedural_rejection` in the Trump administration's discourse, which contrasts sharply with the consistent affirmation of procedural legitimacy and institutional respect in the speeches of other presidents. For instance, Trump's rhetoric frequently targeted the "failed establishment," while his predecessors and successor consistently emphasized shared responsibility and constitutional processes. The framework proved highly effective, demonstrating excellent internal consistency for both its health (α = 0.98) and pathology (α = 0.92) dimensions and successfully discriminating between fundamentally different rhetorical approaches to constitutional governance.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **A Sharp Rhetorical Break, Not a Gradual Decline:** The Trump administration's constitutional rhetoric represents a statistically significant and radical departure from a multi-decade bipartisan norm. While Clinton, Bush W., Obama, and Biden all maintained high and statistically indistinguishable `constitutional_health_index` scores (M > 0.67), Trump's was uniquely negative (M = -0.21). This suggests a distinct rhetorical phenomenon rather than a trend of partisan polarization.
*   **Institutional Subversion as the Primary Driver:** The most significant difference between administrations was found on the institutional axis (F = 14.98, p < .001). The Trump administration's discourse was characterized by a high degree of `institutional_subversion`, with rhetoric targeting the "failed establishment" and "government corruption." In contrast, other presidents consistently voiced respect for institutional roles and duties, such as President Obama's reference to the Founders distributing "power between states and branches of government."
*   **Pathology Replaces Health as a Rhetorical Focus:** The Trump administration is the only one with a high average `constitutional_pathology_index` (M = 0.45), a measure of combined procedural, institutional, and systemic attacks. This is nearly an order of magnitude greater than the next highest (Bush W., M = 0.05). This was driven by rhetoric advocating for systemic replacement, as seen in the call for "a new vision" to "govern our land" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt).
*   **High Variance Signals Rhetorical Inconsistency:** The Trump administration's constitutional health scores exhibited significantly higher variance than any other presidency (Levene's Test, p < .001). While speeches like his 2017 and 2025 inaugurals scored extremely low (M = -0.74 and M = -0.58), his State of the Union addresses were less pathological, sometimes including traditional appeals to "break decades of political stalemate" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2020.txt). This suggests a strategic variability not present in the more consistent rhetoric of other presidents.
*   **A Return to Normative Rhetoric:** The Biden administration's discourse marks a clear return to the pre-Trump rhetorical baseline. Its mean `constitutional_health_index` (M = 0.85) is statistically indistinguishable from those of Clinton, Bush W., and Obama. This is supported by a focus on procedural legitimacy, such as the declaration that "democracy has prevailed" (Source: Biden_Inaugural_2021.txt).
*   **Framework Validity Confirmed:** The CHF v10.0 demonstrated strong construct validity and reliability. The "health" dimensions (`procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`, `systemic_continuity`) showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.98), as did the "pathology" dimensions (`procedural_rejection`, `institutional_subversion`, `systemic_replacement`) (α = 0.92). This confirms that the framework is reliably measuring two distinct, coherent constructs.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description
This analysis employed the **Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0**, a computational tool designed to systematically evaluate the impact of political discourse on constitutional systems. Grounded in the theoretical work of Bagehot, Fukuyama, and Rauch, the CHF assesses rhetoric across three bipolar axes:

1.  **Procedural Axis:** `Procedural Legitimacy` (support for established processes) vs. `Procedural Rejection` (advocacy for bypassing norms).
2.  **Institutional Axis:** `Institutional Respect` (recognition of institutional authority) vs. `Institutional Subversion` (delegitimizing attacks on institutions).
3.  **Systemic Axis:** `Systemic Continuity` (support for gradual reform) vs. `Systemic Replacement` (advocacy for revolutionary change).

A key innovation of the CHF is its use of **salience weighting**. Each of the six core dimensions is scored for both intensity (`raw_score`) and rhetorical prominence (`salience`). This allows the derived metrics, such as the primary `constitutional_health_index`, to reflect not just the presence of certain themes but the speaker's strategic emphasis.

### Corpus Description
The analysis was conducted on the **Presidential Addresses to Congress Corpus (v10.0)**, a collection of 48 documents spanning from 1992 to 2025. The corpus includes State of the Union (SOTU) addresses, inaugural addresses, and other joint session speeches from six presidential administrations: George H.W. Bush (n=1, used as a baseline), Clinton (n=12), George W. Bush (n=11), Obama (n=12), Trump (n=7), and Biden (n=6). This comprehensive dataset provides a robust basis for comparing constitutional rhetoric across different presidencies and political contexts.

### Statistical Methods
The analysis utilized a suite of statistical tests to evaluate the experimental hypotheses.
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (M) and Standard Deviation (SD) were calculated for all primary and derived metrics, grouped by administration.
*   **Inferential Statistics:** A **one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** was performed to test for significant differences in the `constitutional_health_index` across the five modern administrations (Clinton, Bush W., Obama, Trump, Biden). The George H.W. Bush speech was excluded from inferential testing due to a sample size of n=1.
*   **Post-Hoc Testing:** A **Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)** test was used for pairwise comparisons between administrations to identify the specific sources of variance found in the ANOVA.
*   **Effect Size:** **Eta-squared (η²)** was calculated to determine the proportion of variance in the `constitutional_health_index` attributable to the presidential administration.
*   **Homogeneity of Variance:** A **Levene's test** was conducted to test the hypothesis that the variance in constitutional health scores was unequal across administrations.
*   **Cluster and Distance Analysis:** Hierarchical clustering and Euclidean distance calculations were used to map the similarity of administration profiles in the six-dimensional constitutional space.
*   **Reliability Analysis:** **Cronbach's alpha (α)** was calculated for the "health" and "pathology" dimension clusters to assess the internal consistency of the framework's constructs.

All statistical tests used a significance level of p < .05. All claims are presented as preliminary findings suggestive of broader patterns, in line with the exploratory nature of this analysis.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics: A Tale of Two Rhetorical Groups

Descriptive statistics reveal a stark division in constitutional rhetoric between the Trump administration and all other modern presidencies. As shown in Table 1, the mean `constitutional_health_index` for the Clinton, Bush W., Obama, and Biden administrations is consistently high and positive. In stark contrast, the Trump administration is the only one to exhibit a negative mean score (M = -0.21), indicating a rhetorical orientation dominated by pathological dimensions.

Conversely, the `constitutional_pathology_index` for the Trump administration (M = 0.45) is dramatically higher than for any other president. The next highest, the Bush W. administration, has a mean pathology score of just 0.05, highlighting the unique prevalence of anti-systemic rhetoric in President Trump's addresses.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key Indices by Administration**

| Administration | Constitutional Health Index (M) | Constitutional Health Index (SD) | Constitutional Pathology Index (M) | Constitutional Pathology Index (SD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Clinton | 0.80 | 0.09 | 0.01 | 0.02 |
| Bush W. | 0.68 | 0.20 | 0.05 | 0.09 |
| Obama | 0.67 | 0.14 | 0.05 | 0.05 |
| **Trump** | **-0.21** | **0.52** | **0.45** | **0.29** |
| Biden | 0.85 | 0.01 | 0.00 | 0.00 |

*Note: M = Mean, SD = Standard Deviation. Scores range from -1.0 to +1.0 for Health Index and 0.0 to 1.0 for Pathology Index.*

The standard deviation for the Trump administration's health index (SD = 0.52) is more than double that of any other president, confirming Hypothesis H₆ that his scores were significantly more variable. This was statistically validated by a significant Levene's test (p < .001). This suggests a less consistent rhetorical strategy, oscillating between moments of traditional discourse and sharp, pathological attacks.

### 5.2 Advanced Metric Analysis: The Institutional Battleground

Analysis of the axis-level health indices reveals that while all three axes showed significant differences between administrations, the institutional dimension was the primary locus of divergence. The ANOVA for the `institutional_health_index` produced the largest F-statistic (F = 14.98, p < .001), followed by the `procedural_health_index` (F = 12.60, p < .001) and `systemic_health_index` (F = 9.23, p < .001).

This indicates that attacks on institutional authority and legitimacy (`institutional_subversion`) were the most powerful rhetorical differentiator in this corpus. This is evident in President Trump's 2017 Inaugural Address, which centered on a narrative of institutional failure: "For too long, a small group in our Nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost... The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt). This contrasts sharply with the approach of other presidents, such as President Obama, who emphasized the foundational role of institutions: "Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government and expected us to argue... over the size and shape of government" (Source: Obama_SOTU_2013.txt).

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis: Coherent Strategies and a Clear Outlier

The framework's internal consistency was validated by strong Cronbach's alpha scores for both the three "health" dimensions (α = 0.98) and the three "pathology" dimensions (α = 0.92). This indicates that the framework successfully measures two coherent, opposing constructs: one oriented toward constitutional maintenance and the other toward constitutional disruption.

Hierarchical cluster analysis visually confirmed the statistical findings, revealing two distinct groups. As shown by the Euclidean distance matrix and clustering tree, the Clinton, Bush W., Obama, and Biden administrations form a tight cluster, indicating similar rhetorical profiles. President Biden clusters most closely with President Clinton, and President Obama with President Bush W. The Trump administration, however, is a profound outlier, joining the main cluster at a massive distance (1.47), confirming that its rhetorical profile is fundamentally different from all others. This finding decisively falsifies Hypothesis H₇, which posited a potential similarity between the Biden and Trump profiles.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights: A Tradition Disrupted

The data paints a clear picture of a stable rhetorical tradition being disrupted. Across parties and decades, presidents from Clinton to Bush W. to Obama employed language that affirmed the constitutional order. Their speeches consistently scored high on `procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`, and `systemic_continuity`. For example, President Clinton called on Congress to "vote up or down on judicial nominations" (Source: Clinton_SOTU_1997.txt), affirming the legislative process. President Bush W. spoke of the need for "strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote" (Source: Bush_SOTU_2003.txt), emphasizing institutional continuity. President Obama reminded listeners that "governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties" (Source: Obama_SOTU_2016.txt), reinforcing democratic norms.

The Trump administration's rhetoric broke sharply from this tradition by replacing themes of legitimacy and continuity with those of rejection and replacement. His 2017 Inaugural Address, which received the lowest `constitutional_health_index` (-0.74) in the entire corpus, was built on a foundation of institutional delegitimization and systemic replacement. The speech's core message was that the existing system had failed: "Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt). This was coupled with a call for a complete reset: "From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt).

This pattern of high pathology continued in projected future speeches. The 2025 Inaugural Address contains explicit calls for procedural circumvention, such as invoking "the Alien Enemies Act of 1798" to "eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt), and direct attacks on institutional integrity, promising that the "vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department... will end" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt). This rhetoric stands in stark contrast to the discourse of President Biden, whose inaugural address focused on restoration and continuity, emphasizing his duty to "defend the Constitution... defend our democracy" (Source: Biden_Inaugural_2021.txt).

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The Constitutional Health Framework v10.0 proved to be a highly effective and discriminating tool for this analysis.
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The framework successfully identified a statistically significant and large difference between administrations (η² = 0.66). This demonstrates its ability to quantify meaningful variations in constitutional discourse.
*   **Construct Validity:** The high Cronbach's alpha scores (α > 0.91) for both health and pathology constructs confirm that the framework's dimensions are internally consistent and measure what they purport to measure.
*   **Salience Weighting:** The salience-weighted indices were crucial for capturing the full picture. The Trump administration's high pathology scores were a product of both high intensity (`raw_score`) and high rhetorical prominence (`salience`) on dimensions like `institutional_subversion`, indicating a deliberate strategic focus.
*   **Context Insensitivity:** The analysis of speech context effects was not significant (p = 0.55), indicating that the framework's findings are robust across different types of presidential addresses (SOTU, Inaugural, etc.). The primary signal detected was the administration's rhetorical strategy, not the specific occasion.

### 5.6 Evidence Integration and Citation

The statistical findings are consistently supported by the textual evidence. The high `institutional_subversion` scores for the Trump administration are substantiated by direct attacks on "government corruption" and the "failed establishment." For example, in his 2018 SOTU, President Trump spoke of how "We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2018.txt). In contrast, the high `institutional_respect` scores for other presidents are backed by quotes affirming their roles. As President Biden stated in his 2023 SOTU, "one of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court" (Source: Biden_SOTU_2023.txt), explicitly acknowledging a constitutional duty. Similarly, the high `procedural_rejection` in Trump's discourse is evidenced by statements that "all we really needed was a new president" instead of new legislation, implying a preference for executive will over the legislative process (Source: Trump_SOTU_2025.txt).

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis have significant implications for understanding the health of democratic discourse. The data suggests that the period from 1992 to 2016 was characterized by a stable, bipartisan consensus on the rhetorical affirmation of constitutional norms in high-profile presidential speeches. The rhetoric of the Trump administration represents a fundamental and statistically robust break from this consensus. This aligns with theoretical work on democratic erosion, such as Fukuyama's, which posits that decay often occurs through the gradual undermining of institutional norms and practices. This analysis provides empirical, quantitative evidence of such undermining at the level of presidential rhetoric.

The central role of the institutional axis in this divergence is particularly noteworthy. The targeted delegitimization of institutions—the "swamp," the "establishment," the "deep state"—appears to be a core component of a distinct rhetorical strategy that challenges the Bagehotian concept of a "living" constitution dependent on respect for its constituent parts. While all presidents engage in criticism, the CHF framework successfully distinguished between constructive calls for reform (scored as `systemic_continuity` or `institutional_respect`) and delegitimizing attacks (`institutional_subversion`).

The return to a high-health rhetorical baseline in the Biden administration is also significant. It suggests that the Trump administration's approach may be an anomaly rather than the start of a permanent new trend in presidential discourse. However, the high variance in Trump's own scores suggests a complex strategy that can adapt its level of pathology, perhaps for different audiences or purposes. Future research could explore the reception of these different rhetorical styles and their impact on public trust in institutions.

This study has several limitations. The corpus is limited to formal addresses to Congress and does not include campaign rallies, press conferences, or social media, where constitutional rhetoric may differ. The sample size, while comprehensive for this speech type, is still relatively small for statistical analysis. Therefore, these findings should be considered preliminary and indicative of patterns that warrant deeper investigation with a broader corpus.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of 48 presidential addresses provides strong empirical evidence that the Trump administration's constitutional rhetoric marked a radical and statistically significant departure from a multi-decade, bipartisan norm of affirming constitutional processes and institutions. While presidents from Clinton to Bush W. to Obama and Biden maintained a consistently high `constitutional_health_index`, the Trump administration's discourse was uniquely characterized by high levels of `constitutional_pathology`, driven primarily by attacks on institutional legitimacy.

The Constitutional Health Framework v10.0 proved to be a robust and reliable instrument, demonstrating high internal consistency and the discriminatory power to quantify these profound differences in rhetorical strategy. The findings suggest that the "health" of a democracy's constitutional discourse is not guaranteed but is a product of deliberate rhetorical choices. The sharp divergence and subsequent reversion to the norm observed in this data provide a valuable, quantitative baseline for monitoring the state of constitutional rhetoric and the potential for democratic erosion or resilience in the future.
