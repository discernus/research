## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational social science analysis of the constitutional health of 48 presidential addresses to Congress from 1992 to 2025, utilizing the Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0. The study reveals a period of remarkable rhetorical stability and high constitutional health from the George H.W. Bush administration through the Obama administration, establishing a consistent bipartisan baseline. This norm is characterized by strong, salience-weighted support for procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity.

The central finding of this analysis is the identification of the Trump administration's rhetoric as a statistically significant and radical departure from this established norm. A one-way ANOVA reveals that administration is the single largest factor explaining variance in constitutional health scores (η² = 0.72, *p* < .001). Post-hoc testing confirms that the Trump administration's mean Constitutional Health Index (*M* = -0.18, *SD* = 0.56) is significantly lower than that of every other modern presidency, all of which cluster tightly together with high positive scores (e.g., Clinton *M* = 0.83, Bush W. *M* = 0.82, Obama *M* = 0.80). This divergence is driven by a sharp increase in rhetoric centered on institutional subversion and systemic replacement. Furthermore, the Trump administration's rhetoric exhibits significantly higher variance (*p* < .001), indicating a volatile and unpredictable constitutional orientation.

The Biden administration's rhetoric marks a clear return to the pre-2017 bipartisan baseline, with constitutional health scores statistically indistinguishable from the Clinton, Bush W., and Obama administrations. This research demonstrates the CHF's effectiveness in quantifying and diagnosing shifts in political discourse, providing empirical evidence of a dramatic, but perhaps temporary, disruption and subsequent restoration of traditional constitutional rhetoric in presidential addresses. The findings suggest that while the foundations of constitutional discourse are resilient, they are not immune to profound, administration-specific challenges.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **A Stable Bipartisan Constitutional Consensus (1992-2016):** Presidential rhetoric from George H.W. Bush to Barack Obama, regardless of political party, demonstrated a consistently high and stable commitment to constitutional health. The mean Constitutional Health Index scores for Clinton (*M* = 0.83), Bush W. (*M* = 0.82), and Obama (*M* = 0.80) are statistically indistinguishable, forming a tight rhetorical cluster.
*   **The Trump Administration as a Radical Outlier:** The Trump administration's rhetoric represents a fundamental break from the modern presidential norm. Its mean Constitutional Health Index (*M* = -0.18) is not only negative but statistically significantly lower than all other administrations analyzed (*p* < .001). Hierarchical clustering and Euclidean distance analysis confirm the Trump administration is a lone outlier, while all other modern presidents group together.
*   **Institutional Subversion and Systemic Replacement as Key Drivers:** The dramatic decline in constitutional health during the Trump administration is primarily driven by a surge in pathological rhetoric. The dimensions with the most significant variation across administrations were `systemic_replacement_raw` (*p* < .001) and `institutional_subversion_raw` (*p* < .001). This is supported by textual evidence, such as the call to end the "vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt).
*   **Extreme Rhetorical Volatility:** Beyond its low average health score, the Trump administration's rhetoric is uniquely volatile. A Levene's test confirms its variance in constitutional health is significantly higher than other administrations (*p* < .001), with a standard deviation (*SD* = 0.56) more than triple that of any other president.
*   **The Biden Administration Marks a Return to Norm:** The Biden administration's constitutional rhetoric (*M* = 0.73) signals a clear return to the pre-2017 bipartisan baseline. Its scores are statistically indistinguishable from the Clinton, Bush W., and Obama administrations, suggesting a restoration of traditional constitutional discourse.
*   **Framework Validation:** The analysis validates the internal coherence of the Constitutional Health Framework. "Health" dimensions (`procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`, `systemic_continuity`) are very strongly intercorrelated (*r* > .95), as are "pathology" dimensions (*r* > .80). The overall `constitutional_health_index` and `constitutional_pathology_index` are almost perfectly negatively correlated (*r* = -0.99), confirming they measure opposing constructs as intended.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description

This analysis employs the **Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0**, a computational tool designed to evaluate the impact of political discourse on the health of a constitutional system. Grounded in the theoretical work of Bagehot, Fukuyama, and Rauch, the CHF assesses rhetoric across three bipolar axes:
1.  **Procedural Axis:** Procedural Legitimacy vs. Procedural Rejection
2.  **Institutional Axis:** Institutional Respect vs. Institutional Subversion
3.  **Systemic Axis:** Systemic Continuity vs. Systemic Replacement

A key innovation of the CHF is its use of **salience weighting**. For each of the six core dimensions, the framework produces not only a `raw_score` (intensity) but also a `salience` score (rhetorical prominence). This allows for the calculation of derived metrics, such as the primary `constitutional_health_index`, that reflect not just the content of the rhetoric but the speaker's strategic emphasis. This dual-track analysis provides a more nuanced understanding of how speakers prioritize and frame constitutional issues.

### Corpus Description

The corpus consists of 48 presidential addresses to Congress, including State of the Union (SOTU) addresses, inaugural addresses, and other joint session speeches. The documents span from a 1992 baseline (George H.W. Bush) to 2025 (projected), covering the Clinton, George W. Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations. This longitudinal corpus allows for robust time-series and cross-administration comparison.

### Statistical Methods

The analysis utilized a suite of statistical tests to evaluate the experiment's hypotheses and explore patterns in the data.
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean (*M*) and standard deviation (*SD*) were calculated for all core and derived metrics, grouped by administration, to identify baseline patterns.
*   **Inferential Statistics:** A **one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)** was performed to test for significant differences in the `constitutional_health_index` across administrations. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used.
*   **Post-Hoc Testing:** A **Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)** test was conducted following the significant ANOVA result to identify which specific administrations differed from one another.
*   **Effect Size:** **Eta-squared (η²)** was calculated to determine the proportion of variance in the `constitutional_health_index` attributable to the presidential administration.
*   **Variance Homogeneity:** A **Levene's test** was used to test the hypothesis that the variance in constitutional health scores was equal across administrations.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** A **Pearson correlation matrix** was computed for all core dimensions and key derived metrics to assess the internal validity of the framework and identify relationships between rhetorical strategies.
*   **Cluster and Distance Analysis:** **Hierarchical clustering (Ward's method)** and **Euclidean distance** calculations were performed on the 6-dimensional profiles of each administration to visualize their rhetorical similarity.
*   **Reliability Analysis:** **Cronbach's alpha** was calculated for the "health" and "pathology" dimensions to assess their internal consistency as measurement scales.

### Limitations

While the findings are statistically robust, it is important to acknowledge the study's limitations. The corpus, while comprehensive for its category, is still a relatively small sample (N=48) for some statistical comparisons. The analysis is limited to a specific, formal genre of political communication (presidential addresses) and may not generalize to other forms of discourse. All findings should be considered indicative of trends within this specific rhetorical context.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics and Administration-Level Patterns

Descriptive analysis of the `constitutional_health_index` reveals a stark divergence between the Trump administration and all other modern presidencies. As shown in Table 1, the mean scores for the Bush H.W., Clinton, Bush W., Obama, and Biden administrations are all high and positive, clustering within a narrow range from 0.73 to 0.85. In dramatic contrast, the Trump administration's mean score is negative (*M* = -0.18).

A similar but inverse pattern is observed for the `constitutional_pathology_index`, which measures the salience-weighted presence of rhetoric attacking constitutional norms. The Trump administration's mean pathology score (*M* = 0.46) is an order of magnitude higher than any other, indicating that rhetoric of procedural rejection, institutional subversion, and systemic replacement was a central and prominent feature of these addresses.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key Indices by Administration**
| Administration | Constitutional Health Index (*M*) | Constitutional Health Index (*SD*) | Constitutional Pathology Index (*M*) | Constitutional Pathology Index (*SD*) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Biden | 0.73 | 0.16 | 0.04 | 0.07 |
| Bush H.W. | 0.85 | N/A | 0.00 | N/A |
| Bush W. | 0.82 | 0.12 | 0.02 | 0.05 |
| Clinton | 0.83 | 0.05 | 0.01 | 0.01 |
| Obama | 0.80 | 0.09 | 0.01 | 0.02 |
| **Trump** | **-0.18** | **0.56** | **0.46** | **0.30** |

*Note: M = Mean, SD = Standard Deviation. N=47 for analysis involving groups.*

The standard deviation for the Trump administration's health index (*SD* = 0.56) is also a significant outlier, more than three times larger than the next highest (Biden, *SD* = 0.16). This was confirmed by a Levene's test, which found a significant difference in variances across groups (*W* = 14.51, *p* < .001), formally confirming Hypothesis H₆. This indicates that the Trump administration's constitutional rhetoric was not only pathologically oriented on average but also exceptionally volatile and inconsistent compared to the stable, high-health rhetoric of its predecessors and successor.

### 5.2 Inferential Analysis: The Trump Administration as a Statistical Anomaly

A one-way ANOVA was conducted to test for differences in the `constitutional_health_index` among administrations. The result was highly significant, *F*(5, 41) = 26.54, *p* < .001, confirming Hypothesis H₁. The effect size was extremely large (η² = 0.72), indicating that the presidential administration alone accounts for 72% of the variance in constitutional health scores.

To pinpoint the source of this difference, a Tukey HSD post-hoc analysis was performed. The results were unambiguous: the Trump administration's mean score was significantly lower than every other administration in the study (all *p* < .001). No other pairwise comparisons between administrations were statistically significant. This confirms Hypotheses H₂, H₃, and H₅, while falsifying H₄. The data provides no evidence of a significant difference in constitutional health rhetoric between Democratic (Clinton, Obama, Biden) and other Republican (Bush H.W., Bush W.) administrations; they form a single, high-health rhetorical bloc from which only the Trump administration deviates.

This separation is visualized in the cluster analysis. The Euclidean distance between the Trump administration's 6-dimensional profile and any other administration (e.g., 1.17 to Biden) is more than ten times greater than the distance between any other two presidents (e.g., 0.05 between Bush W. and Obama). This falsifies Hypothesis H₇, which posited a similarity between Biden and Trump. The data shows the opposite: Biden's rhetoric is dimensionally very similar to Obama's, and both are exceptionally distant from Trump's.

### 5.3 Correlation and Interaction Analysis: Coherent Rhetorical Strategies

The Pearson correlation matrix reveals strong, theoretically consistent relationships between the framework's dimensions, validating its internal structure. The three "health" dimensions (`procedural_legitimacy`, `institutional_respect`, `systemic_continuity`) are all very strongly and positively correlated with each other (*r* > .95). This suggests that speakers who support one aspect of constitutional health tend to support them all, deploying a coherent **pro-constitutional rhetorical strategy**. For example, in his 2009 address, President Bush W. combined institutional respect and procedural legitimacy, stating, "These institutions, these unseen pillars of civilization, must remain strong in America, and we will defend them," and affirming that if judges overstep, "the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process" (Source: Bush_SOTU_2009.txt).

Conversely, the three "pathology" dimensions (`procedural_rejection`, `institutional_subversion`, `systemic_replacement`) are also strongly and positively correlated with each other (*r* > .80). This indicates a cohesive **anti-constitutional rhetorical strategy**, where attacks on one pillar of the system are accompanied by attacks on others. This pattern is most evident in the Trump administration's rhetoric. In his 2025 inaugural address, the analysis captured calls for procedural rejection ("I will declare a national emergency at our southern border") alongside institutional subversion ("The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our Government will end") (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt).

The `constitutional_health_index` and `constitutional_pathology_index` are nearly perfectly negatively correlated (*r* = -0.99), confirming they function as valid, opposing measures of the underlying construct.

### 5.4 Pattern Recognition: The Drivers of Pathological Rhetoric

Analysis of which dimensions varied most significantly across administrations shows that the divergence was primarily driven by the "pathology" dimensions. The two dimensions with the largest F-statistics were `systemic_replacement_raw` (*F* = 21.34) and `institutional_subversion_raw` (*F* = 21.21). This indicates that the most dramatic difference in presidential rhetoric was the introduction of prominent, high-salience themes of replacing the existing system and delegitimizing its core institutions.

While all presidents engage in some criticism, the CHF's disambiguation rules distinguish constructive critique from delegitimizing subversion. For instance, President Obama's statement that "Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise" (Source: Obama_SOTU_2013.txt) was coded as a critique of partisan behavior, not an attack on the institution of democracy itself. In contrast, President Trump's 2017 inaugural address, with its themes of "American carnage" and a failed establishment, was coded with high `institutional_subversion` and `systemic_replacement`, contributing to its extremely low health score of -0.79.

### 5.5 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The results demonstrate the high discriminatory power and reliability of the Constitutional Health Framework v10.0.
*   **Discriminatory Power:** The massive effect size (η² = 0.72) for the `administration` variable shows the framework is exceptionally sensitive to meaningful shifts in constitutional discourse, successfully isolating a major change in the rhetorical landscape.
*   **Reliability:** The internal consistency of the measurement scales was excellent. The three "health" dimensions achieved a Cronbach's alpha of 0.98, and the three "pathology" dimensions achieved a Cronbach's alpha of 0.94. These high values indicate that the dimensions reliably measure the coherent constructs of constitutional health and pathology.
*   **Salience-Weighting:** The salience-weighted indices proved crucial. The `constitutional_pathology_index` for the Trump administration (*M* = 0.46) shows that pathological themes were not merely present but were rhetorically central to the message, a nuance that a simple intensity score might miss.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis offer a stark, quantitative picture of the state of presidential constitutional rhetoric. The most significant implication is the empirical identification of a stable, bipartisan "constitutional consensus" in presidential addresses from 1992-2016, a norm from which the Trump administration radically departed. This consensus, characterized by high scores in procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity, appears to be a feature of modern institutional governance, as presidents of both parties have historically used this formal platform to reinforce the system they lead. As President George W. Bush stated, "The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings" (Source: Bush_Inaugural_2001.txt), a sentiment reflecting this shared baseline.

The Trump administration's rhetoric, as measured by the CHF, represents a clear break. The combination of low mean health, high mean pathology, and extreme volatility suggests a fundamentally different approach to constitutional governance. The drivers of this shift—institutional subversion and systemic replacement—align with theoretical concepts of democratic erosion, where the delegitimization of institutions and norms precedes formal changes. The data suggests a rhetorical strategy aimed not at working within the existing constitutional framework, but at positioning it as a "failed establishment" in need of "complete overhaul."

The Biden administration's return to the previous rhetorical baseline is equally significant. It suggests that the disruption observed may be specific to an administration's unique populist, anti-establishment strategy rather than a permanent partisan realignment in constitutional discourse. The fact that Biden's scores are statistically indistinguishable from those of Clinton, Bush W., and Obama points to the resilience of the traditional rhetorical norm.

Finally, the non-significant effect of speech context (SOTU vs. Inaugural vs. Joint Session) was an interesting finding. While one might expect the soaring, unifying rhetoric of an inaugural address to score differently from a policy-focused SOTU, the data shows that the speaker's administration is a far more powerful predictor of constitutional health than the specific occasion. This reinforces the central finding that the observed shift is a feature of a particular governance style, not a contextual artifact.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of 48 presidential addresses provides robust, empirical evidence of a dramatic disruption and subsequent restoration of constitutional rhetoric in the American presidency. For a quarter-century, a stable, bipartisan consensus valuing procedural, institutional, and systemic health prevailed. The Trump administration marked a statistically unprecedented departure from this norm, introducing a volatile and pathological rhetorical style centered on delegitimizing the very system of governance. The Biden administration's discourse signals a return to the long-standing rhetorical tradition.

The Constitutional Health Framework v10.0 proved to be a highly effective and reliable instrument for diagnosing these trends. Its ability to distinguish between administrations with such a large effect size, combined with its high internal reliability, validates its use as a tool for monitoring the health of democratic discourse. Future research should apply this framework to a wider range of political communication, including legislative debates, campaign rhetoric, and media commentary, to determine if the patterns observed here are unique to the presidency or reflective of broader trends in the political ecosystem.
