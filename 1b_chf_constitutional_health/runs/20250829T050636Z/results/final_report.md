## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the constitutional health of U.S. presidential addresses to Congress from 1992 to 2025. Utilizing the Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0, this study analyzed 48 speeches across six administrations (Bush H.W., Clinton, Bush W., Obama, Trump, Biden) to measure discourse patterns related to procedural legitimacy, institutional respect, and systemic continuity. The analysis reveals a period of relative stability in constitutional rhetoric from the Bush H.W. through the Obama administrations, followed by a statistically significant and profound departure during the Trump administration, and a subsequent return to prior norms under the Biden administration.

The central finding is that the Trump administration’s discourse exhibits a dramatically lower mean Constitutional Health Index (CHI) (M = -0.21) compared to the Clinton (M = 0.80), Bush W. (M = 0.68), Obama (M = 0.67), and Biden (M = 0.85) administrations. This difference is highly significant (ANOVA F(5, 41) = 16.37, p < .001), with a large effect size (η² = 0.66). The Trump administration’s rhetoric is uniquely characterized by a high Constitutional Pathology Index (M = 0.45), driven by salient themes of institutional subversion and procedural rejection. In contrast, the Clinton, Bush W., Obama, and Biden administrations consistently demonstrated high levels of support for constitutional processes and institutions, with negligible pathology scores.

The CHF framework proved highly effective in quantifying these rhetorical shifts. Its salience-weighted metrics and multi-axial design successfully captured not only the presence of pathological discourse but its centrality to the Trump administration's messaging. The framework's internal reliability was strong, with Cronbach's alpha scores of α = 0.98 for health-oriented dimensions and α = 0.92 for pathology-oriented dimensions. These preliminary findings suggest a significant normative shift in presidential constitutional discourse, warranting further investigation into its causes and potential effects on democratic health.

## 2. Key Insights

*   **Significant Divergence in Constitutional Health:** The Trump administration’s constitutional rhetoric represents a radical and statistically significant departure from modern presidential norms. Its mean Constitutional Health Index (M = -0.21) is profoundly lower than that of the Clinton (M = 0.80), Bush W. (M = 0.68), Obama (M = 0.67), and Biden (M = 0.85) administrations. The difference is statistically significant (p < .001).
*   **Pathology as a Rhetorical Strategy:** The Trump administration is a significant outlier in its use of constitutionally pathological rhetoric. Its mean Constitutional Pathology Index (M = 0.45) is nearly nine times higher than the next highest administration (Bush W., M = 0.05). This was driven by a focus on delegitimizing institutions, as when President Trump stated, "For too long, a small group in our Nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt).
*   **Institutional and Procedural Axes as Key Battlegrounds:** The most significant differences between administrations occurred along the Institutional and Procedural Health axes. The Trump administration scored uniquely low on Institutional Health, driven by high Institutional Subversion. As President Trump claimed, "The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our Government will end" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt). This contrasts sharply with other presidents who consistently affirmed institutional roles.
*   **High Rhetorical Volatility:** The Trump administration displayed significantly higher variance in its constitutional health scores than any other administration (Levene’s Test, p < .001). This suggests a more volatile and less predictable approach to constitutional discourse, oscillating between traditional appeals and sharp attacks on the system.
*   **Return to Norms:** The Biden administration’s discourse marks a clear return to the high levels of constitutional health characteristic of the pre-Trump era. Its mean CHI (M = 0.85) is statistically indistinguishable from the Clinton and Obama administrations, emphasizing themes of democratic restoration. As President Biden stated, "We’ve learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed" (Source: Biden_Inaugural_2021.txt).
*   **Framework Efficacy:** The Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0 demonstrated high internal consistency (α > 0.91 for both health and pathology constructs) and strong discriminatory power. Its salience-weighted metrics were crucial for distinguishing between incidental critiques and central rhetorical strategies, proving effective in quantifying the observed shifts in presidential discourse.

## 4. Methodology

### Framework Description

This analysis employed the **Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0**, a computational model designed to evaluate how political discourse impacts the health of a constitutional system. Grounded in the theoretical work of Bagehot, Fukuyama, and Rauch, the CHF assesses discourse along three bipolar axes:

1.  **Procedural Axis:** Measures the balance between *Procedural Legitimacy* (support for established processes) and *Procedural Rejection* (advocacy for circumventing processes).
2.  **Institutional Axis:** Measures the balance between *Institutional Respect* (recognizing institutional authority) and *Institutional Subversion* (delegitimizing attacks on institutions).
3.  **Systemic Axis:** Measures the balance between *Systemic Continuity* (support for gradual reform) and *Systemic Replacement* (advocacy for revolutionary change).

A key innovation of the CHF is its use of **salience weighting**. Each of the six core dimensions is scored for both raw intensity (0-1) and rhetorical salience (0-1), which measures its prominence and centrality to the speaker's message. This allows for the calculation of derived metrics, including axis-level health indices and two primary summary scores: the **Constitutional Health Index (CHI)**, a measure of overall positive orientation towards the constitutional system, and the **Constitutional Pathology Index (CPI)**, a measure of the overall threat level.

### Corpus and Data Structure

The corpus consists of 48 presidential addresses to Congress delivered between 1992 and 2025, including State of the Union, inaugural, and joint session speeches. The documents were sourced from the American Presidency Project and analyzed using the CHF v10.0, producing raw and salience scores for the six core dimensions. These scores, along with document metadata (administration, speech type, year), formed the dataset for statistical analysis.

### Statistical Methods

The analysis proceeded through several stages:
1.  **Derived Metrics Calculation:** The raw and salience scores were used to compute the axis-level indices, CHI, and CPI for each document as per the framework's formulas.
2.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean and standard deviation for all key metrics were calculated for each administration to identify central tendencies and dispersion.
3.  **Inferential Testing:** A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test for significant differences in the mean CHI across the five modern administrations (Clinton, Bush W., Obama, Trump, Biden). A Tukey HSD post-hoc test was used for pairwise comparisons.
4.  **Variance Analysis:** Levene's test was used to assess the homogeneity of variance in CHI scores across administrations.
5.  **Cluster and Distance Analysis:** Hierarchical clustering and Euclidean distance calculations were performed on the mean six-dimensional profiles of each administration to map their rhetorical similarity.
6.  **Reliability Analysis:** Cronbach's alpha was calculated for the three "health" dimensions and the three "pathology" dimensions to assess the internal consistency of the framework's constructs.

All statistical tests used a significance level of α = 0.05. Given the preliminary nature of this study, findings are interpreted as indicative rather than definitive.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics and Overall Trends

The analysis of presidential addresses reveals a stark divergence in constitutional discourse, primarily isolating the Trump administration from its predecessors and successor. As shown in Table 1, the mean Constitutional Health Index (CHI) for the Clinton (M = 0.80, SD = 0.09), Bush W. (M = 0.68, SD = 0.20), Obama (M = 0.67, SD = 0.14), and Biden (M = 0.85, SD = 0.01) administrations fall within a relatively high and stable range. In dramatic contrast, the Trump administration exhibits a negative mean CHI (M = -0.21, SD = 0.52).

This pattern is mirrored in the Constitutional Pathology Index (CPI). The Trump administration’s mean CPI (M = 0.45) is exceptionally high, while all other administrations score near zero, indicating that pathological rhetoric was a central feature of its discourse but largely absent in others.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key Metrics by Administration**

| Administration | N  | Constitutional Health Index (M, SD) | Constitutional Pathology Index (M, SD) |
| :------------- | :- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Clinton        | 11 | 0.80 (0.09)                         | 0.01 (0.02)                            |
| Bush W.        | 10 | 0.68 (0.20)                         | 0.05 (0.09)                            |
| Obama          | 10 | 0.67 (0.14)                         | 0.05 (0.05)                            |
| Trump          | 6  | -0.21 (0.52)                        | 0.45 (0.29)                            |
| Biden          | 5  | 0.85 (0.01)                         | 0.00 (0.00)                            |

### 5.2 Hypothesis Testing: A Rhetorical Break

Inferential testing confirms the significance of these descriptive patterns.

**Primary Hypothesis (H₁):** A one-way ANOVA revealed a highly significant difference in CHI scores across administrations (F(5, 41) = 16.37, p < .001). The effect size was very large (η² = 0.66), indicating that the presidential administration accounts for approximately 66% of the variance in constitutional health scores. This confirms H₁, rejecting the null hypothesis that all administrations have equal constitutional health scores.

**Secondary Hypotheses (H₂-H₅):** The Tukey HSD post-hoc test (Table 2) pinpointed the source of this difference. The Trump administration’s mean CHI was significantly lower than that of every other administration tested (all p < .001). This confirms H₂ (Trump ≠ Bush W.) and H₃ (Trump ≠ Clinton, Obama). Conversely, there were no significant differences between the Biden, Clinton, and Obama administrations, falsifying H₄. The magnitude of the Biden-Trump difference (1.058) far exceeded other cross-party differences, such as Clinton-Bush W. (0.124), confirming H₅.

**Table 2: Tukey HSD Pairwise Comparisons of Constitutional Health Index**

| Comparison        | Mean Difference | p-adj | Result        |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :---- | :------------ |
| **Biden - Trump** | 1.058           | <.001 | **Significant** |
| **Clinton - Trump** | 1.008           | <.001 | **Significant** |
| **Obama - Trump**   | 0.879           | <.001 | **Significant** |
| **Bush W. - Trump** | 0.884           | <.001 | **Significant** |
| Biden - Clinton   | -0.050          | 0.999 | Not Significant |
| Biden - Obama     | -0.180          | 0.753 | Not Significant |

*Note: Table shows selected significant and non-significant comparisons for clarity.*

**Outlier and Response Hypotheses (H₆-H₇):** Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance was highly significant (p < .001), confirming H₆ that the variance in CHI scores is not equal across administrations. The descriptive data (Table 1) clearly shows the Trump administration’s standard deviation (SD = 0.52) is substantially larger than any other, indicating greater rhetorical volatility. Hierarchical clustering and Euclidean distance analysis decisively falsified H₇. The Trump administration is a distant outlier, while the Biden administration clusters closely with the Clinton and Obama administrations, demonstrating a return to, not a continuation of, the divergent pattern.

### 5.3 Dimensional Contribution Analysis

To understand the drivers of the overall health score divergence, ANOVAs were run on the three axis-level health indices and the pathology index. All showed highly significant differences across administrations:
*   **Institutional Health Index:** F = 14.98, p < .001
*   **Constitutional Pathology Index:** F = 13.60, p < .001
*   **Procedural Health Index:** F = 12.60, p < .001
*   **Systemic Health Index:** F = 9.23, p < .001

The Institutional Health Index showed the largest effect, indicating that rhetoric surrounding the legitimacy and authority of institutions was the primary locus of divergence. This was driven by the Trump administration’s high scores on **Institutional Subversion**. For example, President Trump’s 2017 inaugural address framed the government as a hostile entity: "For too long, a small group in our Nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt). This contrasts sharply with the rhetoric of other presidents, such as President Clinton, who framed government as a partner: "We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other" (Source: Clinton_SOTU_2000.txt).

The high significance of the Constitutional Pathology Index further underscores that the Trump administration’s discourse was not merely less healthy, but actively more pathological. This was evident in its high levels of **Procedural Rejection**, such as when President Trump framed legitimate oversight as an invalid process: "If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn’t work that way" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2020.txt). This stands in contrast to the norm of appealing to established processes, as seen when President Biden called on Congress to "pass the Freedom To Vote act. Pass the John Lewis Act—Voting Rights Act" (Source: Biden_SOTU_2023.txt).

### 5.4 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

The CHF framework demonstrated strong performance. The Cronbach's alpha values for the health-oriented dimensions (α = 0.98) and pathology-oriented dimensions (α = 0.92) indicate high internal consistency, suggesting the framework’s constructs are coherent and reliable. The framework’s ability to distinguish so clearly between administrations, as shown by the large effect size in the ANOVA, speaks to its discriminatory power. The salience-weighting was particularly crucial, as it allowed the analysis to capture that pathological themes were not just present but rhetorically central to the Trump administration's messaging, while themes of continuity and legitimacy were central to others. For instance, President Obama’s 2013 inaugural address was built around the theme of continuity: "Today we continue a never-ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time" (Source: Obama_Inaugural_2013.txt), resulting in a high salience score for Systemic Continuity.

## 6. Discussion

The findings of this analysis point to a significant normative shift in American presidential discourse regarding the constitutional system. For over two decades, from Bush H.W. to Obama, presidential addresses to Congress, regardless of party, adhered to a consistent rhetorical framework that affirmed the legitimacy of constitutional processes, respected the authority of co-equal institutions, and framed change as a gradual evolution of the existing system. This shared rhetorical foundation, visible in the stable and high CHI scores, can be seen as a reflection of a broad elite consensus on the fundamentals of American governance.

The Trump administration’s discourse marks a clear and profound break from this consensus. The sharp drop in the Constitutional Health Index and the corresponding spike in the Constitutional Pathology Index are not artifacts of partisan difference but represent a fundamentally different approach to constitutional rhetoric. The data suggests a shift from a strategy of working within the system to a strategy that actively delegitimizes it. The high salience of Institutional Subversion and Procedural Rejection indicates that challenging the "establishment" and its processes was a core component of the administration's political project. This is exemplified by rhetoric that frames the government as a "swamp" and legitimate oversight as "ridiculous, partisan investigations."

The return to high CHI scores under the Biden administration is equally significant. It suggests that the Trump era's rhetorical patterns may have been an aberration rather than a permanent realignment of presidential discourse. President Biden’s speeches, with their explicit focus on restoring democratic norms and proving "democracy still works," can be interpreted as a direct rhetorical counter-programming to the preceding administration. As he stated in his 2021 inaugural, "We’ve learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed" (Source: Biden_Inaugural_2021.txt).

These findings have important implications for the study of democratic health. They provide empirical, quantifiable evidence for the phenomenon of democratic erosion through discourse. The CHF framework allows us to move beyond anecdotal observation to systematically measure how rhetoric can undermine or reinforce the normative foundations of a constitutional system. The high variance in the Trump administration's scores also suggests a strategic unpredictability that may itself be corrosive to institutional stability.

### Limitations and Future Directions

This study is preliminary and has several limitations. The sample size (N=48), while comprehensive for this speech type, is small for broad generalizations. The analysis is limited to a single, formal speech genre and does not capture campaign rhetoric, media appearances, or social media communications, which may exhibit different patterns.

Future research should expand the corpus to include a wider range of political discourse and a longer historical timeframe to determine if the pre-Trump stability was itself a historical anomaly. Further analysis could investigate the causal relationship between this rhetoric and public trust in institutions. Finally, applying the CHF to other democratic systems could provide valuable comparative insights into the rhetorical markers of democratic resilience and decay.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of presidential addresses to Congress provides robust, quantitative evidence of a significant divergence in American constitutional discourse. The period from 1992 to 2016 was characterized by a stable, shared rhetorical commitment to constitutional health. The Trump administration marked a sharp, statistically significant departure from this norm, distinguished by highly salient pathological rhetoric targeting core democratic institutions and processes. The subsequent Biden administration has, in its formal addresses, returned to the pre-existing norms.

The Constitutional Health Framework v10.0 proved to be a reliable and powerful tool for detecting and measuring these shifts. The findings validate the framework's core constructs and demonstrate the value of salience-weighted analysis in capturing the strategic emphasis of political communication. This research underscores the critical role that presidential discourse plays in either upholding or undermining the constitutional system and provides a replicable methodology for monitoring the health of democratic rhetoric over time.
